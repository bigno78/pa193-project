                 1.2 TOE Overview
                      The TOE consists of the Micro Controller and a software stack which is stored on the
                      Micro Controller and which can be executed by the Micro Controller. The software stack
                      can be further split into the following components:
                      • Firmware for booting and low level functionality of the Micro Controller (MC FW)
                        like writing to flash memory. This includes software for implementing cryptographic
                        operations, called Crypto Library.
                      • Software for implementing a Java Card Virtual Machine [15], a Java Card Runtime
                        Environment [16] and a Java Card Application Programming Interface [14], called
                        JCVM, JCRE and JCAPI.
                      • Software for implementing content management according to GlobalPlatform [17],
                        called GlobalPlatform (GP) Framework.
                      • Software for executing native libraries, called Secure Box.
                      The TOE is referred to as JCOP 4.7 SE051. The JCOP 4 Operating System (JCOP 4
                      OS) consists of the software stack without the Crypto Library (Crypto Lib) and without
                      the Micro Controller Firmware (MC FW). The TOE uses one or more communication
                      interfaces to communicate with its environment.
                      The complete TOE is depicted in Figure 1. The elements are described in more detail in
                      Section 1.3 "TOE Description".

 Figure 1. Components of the TOE

                               Figure 1 shows the components of the TOE. The TOE is a composite product on top
                               of CC certified Hardware, Firmware and Crypto Library. Part of the TOE are the JCVM,
                               JCRE, JCAPI and the GP Framework. Also included is optional functionality and the
                               Secure Box mechanism. The Secure Box Native Librarys provide native functions for
                               untrusted third parties and are not part of the TOE.
                               The figure shows Java Card applets which are small programs in Java language that can
                               be executed by the TOE, but are not part of the TOE.

                     1.2.1 Usage and Major Security Features of the TOE
                               The usage of the TOE is focused on security critical applications in small form factors.
                               One main usage scenario is the use of so called smart cards. Examples of such cards
                               are banking cards or electronic drivers’ licenses. The TOE can also be used in an
                               electronic passport. Another usage scenario is device authentication, where the TOE can
                               be used to prove the authenticity or originality of a device like an accessory for a gaming
                               console.
                               The TOE provides a variety of security features. The hardware of the Micro Controller
                               already protects against logical and physical attacks by applying various sensors to
                               detect manipulations and by processing data in ways which protect against leakage
                               of data by side channel analysis. With the software stack the TOE provides many

                 1.2.2 TOE Type
                      The TOE is a Java Card with a GP Framework. It can be used to load and execute off-
                      card verified Java Card applets.

                 1.2.3 Required non-TOE Hardware/Software/Firmware
                      Three groups of users shall be distinguished here.
                      The first group is the end-users group, which uses the TOE with one or more loaded
                      applets in the final form factor like a banking card or an electronic passport. These users
                      only require a communication device to be able to communicate with the TOE. The
                      communication protocol of the TOE is standardized in either ISO7816 [31] (T=1, T=0),
                      ISO14443 [32] (T=CL), or UM10204 [33] (I2C Slave).
                      The second group of users are administrators of cards. They want to configure the
                      card by using the Configuration Module, to install additional applets and to configure and
                      personalise these applets. These users require the same equipment as end-users.
                      The third group of users wants to develop Java Card applets and execute them on
                      the TOE. These applet developers need in addition to the communication device a
                      set of tools for the development of applets. This set of tools can be obtained from the
                      TOE vendor and comprises elements such as PC development environment, byte code
                      verifier, compiler, linker and debugger.

                     1.3 TOE Description

                    1.3.1 TOE Components and Composite Certification
                           The certification of this TOE is a composite certification. The following sections provide
                           a more detailed description of the components of Figure 1. It is also made clear whether
                           a component is covered by a previous certification or whether it is covered in the
                           certification of this TOE.

                  1.3.1.1 Micro Controller

                           The Micro Controller is a secure smart card controller from NXP’s SmartMX3 family.
                           The Micro Controller contains a co-processor for symmetric cryptographic operations,
                           supporting DES and AES, as well as an accelerator for asymmetric cryptographic
                           algorithms. The Micro Controller further contains a physical random number generator.
                           The supported memory technologies are volatile (Random Access Memory (RAM)) and
                           non-volatile (Read Only Memory (ROM) and FLASH) memory.
                           Access to all memory types is controlled by a Memory Management Unit (MMU) which
                           allows to separate and restrict access to parts of the memory.
                           The Micro Controller has been certified in a previous certification and the results are re-
                           used for this certification. The exact reference to the previous certification is given in the
                           following Table 2 "Reference to Certified Micro Controller":

                           Table 2. Reference to Certified Micro Controller

                                                                          [1]

                           Certification ID                BSI-DSZ-CC-1040
                           Reference                       [10]

                           [1]   The SE051 hardware is an instantiation of the N7121 hard macro with I2C side-car.


                  1.3.1.2 Security IC Dedicated Software

                 1.3.1.2.1 MC FW (Micro Controller Firmware)

                           The Micro Controller Firmware is used for testing of the Micro Controller at production,
                           for booting of the Micro Controller after power-up or after reset, for configuration of
                           communication devices and for writing data to volatile and non-volatile memory.
                           The MC FW has been certified together with the Micro Controller and the same reference
                           [10] as given for the Micro Controller also apply for the MC FW.

                 1.3.1.2.2 Crypto Library

                           The Crypto Library provides implementations for symmetric and asymmetric
                           cryptographic operations, hashing, the generation of hybrid deterministic and hybrid
                           physical random numbers and further functions like secure copy and compare.
                           Some of the cryptographic algorithms offered by the Crypto Lib are not certified, see
                           Section 1.3.1.4 "Excluded functionality".
                           The symmetric cryptographic operations comprise the algorithms 3DES and AES. These
                           algorithms use the symmetric co-processor of the Micro Controller.

                          The supported asymmetric cryptographic operations are ECC and RSA. These
                          algorithms use the Public Key Crypto Coprocessor (PKCC) of the Micro Controller for the
                          cryptographic operations.
                          The Crypto Library has been certified together with the Micro Controller and the same
                          reference [10] as given for the Micro Controller also applies.

                  1.3.1.3 Security IC Embedded Software

                 1.3.1.3.1 JCOP 4.7 SE051

                          The OS of the TOE consists of JCVM, JCRE, JCAPI and GP framework. It is
                          implemented according to the Java Card Specification and GlobalPlatform. Additionally it
                          consists of a proprietary API, which is described in the UGM [9].
                          The TOE can be identified by using the IDENTIFY APDU command (see UGM [9]). This
                          command returns the card identification data, which includes a Platform ID, a Patch ID
                          and other information that allows to identify the content in ROM, FLASH and loaded
                          patches (if any).
                          The TOE also includes a Configuration Module (see Section 1.3.2 "Optional TOE
                          Functionality") which is used for personalisation and configuration of the TOE. It must be
                          deleted after the personalisation is finished (end of Phase 6 ”Personalisation”) by using
                          the DELETE APDU command. Once the Configuration Module is deleted, it is no longer
                          possible to configure the TOE.
                          The TOE contains further functionality for integrity protection of user data via an
                          EDC, encryption of user data via PUF [12] and optional functionality as described in
                          Section 1.3.2 "Optional TOE Functionality".

                  1.3.1.4 Excluded functionality

                          All Secure Box Native Libraries are not part of the TOE. No security functional
                          requirements are claimed on AES CCM, HMAC, HKDF, ECDAA, elliptic curve
                          cryptography based on Edwards and Montgomery curves and FIPS self-tests, they are

                  1.3.3 TOE Reduced Feature Set
                        The TOE is also available to customers with a reduced feature set. This variant of the
                        TOE contains a different base mask configuraton and has some features removed from
                        the TOE. The removed features are:
                        •   No support for SecureBox
                        •   No RSA support in GP
                        •   No DES support in GP
                        •   SCP01 not supported
                        •   SCP02 not supported
                        •   GP CVM service not supported
                        •   GP command chaining is not supported
                        •   ISO 7816 T=1, T=0 (UART) interface not supported
                        The base mask with the reduced feature set is known as IOT Reduced, while the base
                        mask with full functionality is known as IOT Full. For more information on the difference
                        in feature set, please refer to Table 3.1 in the User Guidance and Administration Manual
                        [9].

                 1.3.3.1 Reduced Security Functional Requirements

                        Some security functionality claimed in this Security Target is no longer available in the
                        IOT Reduced base mask or has limited functionality and the corresponding Security
                        Functional Requirements are not (completely) applicable for this variant of the TOE. The

                      The evaluation process is limited to phases 1 to 5. User Applet development is outside
                      the scope of this evaluation. Applets can be loaded into FLASH in phases 3, 4, 5, and 6.
                      Applet loading in phase 7 is also allowed. This means post-issuance loading of applets
                      can be done for a certified TOE.
                      The Configuration Module is loaded into FLASH and has special privileges to personalize
                      and configure the TOE. Before life cycle Phase 7 "Operational Use" the Configuration
                      Module is deleted and hence it is ensured that its functionality cannot be used
                      afterwards. It is possible to load patch code into FLASH in phases 3, 4, 5, and 6. The
                      certification is only valid for the ROM code having the Platform Identifiers and the Patch
                      IDs (if applicable) as stated in Table 5 "Delivery Items".
                      The delivery process from NXP to their customers (to phase 4 or phase 5 of the life
                      cycle) guarantees that the customer is aware of the exact versions of the different parts
                      of the TOE as outlined above.

                         DIAG, A.USE_KEYS) that users handle securely the TOE and related Objectives for the
                         environment are defined (OE.USE_DIAG, OE.USE_KEYS).

                 1.3.5.2 TOE Identification

                         The TOE can be identified by using the Platform ID, the FLASH ID and the Patch ID. The
                         IDENTIFY command and the identification output for this TOE are described in detail
                         in Chapter 2 of the UGM [9]. The IDENTIFY command also returns information about
                         presence of optional functionality and allows to identify the IOT Full and IOT Reduced
                         base mask configuration.

                  1.3.6 Evaluated Package Types
                         A number of package types are supported for this TOE. All package types, which are
                         covered by the certification of the used hardware (see [10]), are also allowed to be used
                         in combination with each product of this TOE.
                         The package types do not influence the security functionality of the TOE. They only
                         define which pads are connected in the package and for what purpose and in which
                         environment the chip can be used. Note that the security of the TOE is not dependent on

2       Conformance Claims (ASE_CCL)
                      This Chapter is divided into the following sections: "CC Conformance Claim", "Package
                      Claim", "PP Claim", and "Conformance Claim Rationale".

                  2.1 CC Conformance Claim
                      This Security Target claims to be conformant to version 3.1 of Common Criteria for
                      Information Technology Security Evaluation according to
                      • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 1, Version 3.1,
                        Revision 5, April 2017" [1]
                      • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 2, Version 3.1,
                        Revision 5, April 2017" [2]
                      • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 3, Version 3.1,
                        Revision 5, April 2017" [3]
                      The following methodology will be used for the evaluation:
                      • Common Methodology for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Evaluation
                        Methodology, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April 2017" [4]
                      This Security Target claims to be CC Part 2 extended and CC Part 3 conformant.
                      The extended Security Functional Requirements are defined in Section 6 "Extended
                      Components Definition (ASE_ECD)".

                  2.2 Package Claim
                      This Security Target claims conformance to the assurance package EAL6. The
                      augmentation to EAL6 is ASE_TSS.2 “TOE summary specification with architectural
                      design summary” and ALC_FLR.1 “Basic flaw remediation”.

                  2.3 PP Claim
                      The Security Target claims demonstrable conformance to the Java Card System -
                      Open Configuration Protection Profile, December 2017, Version 3.0.5 [6], certified by
                      Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI, BSI-CC-PP-0099-2017). The
                      Java Card Protection Profile makes the use of Java Card RMI optional. The TOE does
                      not support Java Card RMI. This ST is more restrictive than the PP [6] which Section 2.4
                      "Conformance Claim Rationale" provides a rational for.

                  2.4 Conformance Claim Rationale

                 2.4.1 TOE Type
                      The TOE type as stated in Section Section 1.2 "TOE Overview" of this ST corresponds
                      to the TOE type of the PP as stated in Section 2.1 of [6] namely a Java Card platform,
                      implementing the Java Card Specification Version 3.0.5 [15], [16], [14].

                  2.4.2 SPD Statement

                 2.4.2.1 Threats

                         The Security Problem Definition (SPD) statement that is presented in Section 4 "Security
                         Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)" includes the threats as presented in the PP [6], but also
                         includes additional threats. These threats are:
                         •   T.OS_OPERATE
                         •   T.RND
                         •   T.COM_EXPLOIT
                         •   T.LIFE_CYCLE
                         •   T.UNAUTHORIZED_CARD_MNGT
                         •   T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA[REFINED]
                         •   T.CONFIG
                         •   T.SEC_BOX_BORDER
                         •   T.MODULE_EXEC
                         •   T.MODULE_REPLACEMENT
                         The threat T.OS_OPERATE is an additional threat added to cover incorrect operating
                         system behavior, it is an addition to the threats in the PP [6].
                         The threat T.RND is taken from the Security IC PP [5].
                         The threat T.COM_EXPLOIT is included to cover communication channels attacks and it
                         is an addition to the threats in the PP [6].
                         The threat T.LIFE_CYCLE is included to cover content management attacks and it is an
                         addition to the threats in the PP [6].
                         The threat T.UNAUTHORIZED_CARD_MNGT refines the threats T.INSTALL and
                         T.DELETION from the Security IC PP [5].
                         The threat T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA[REFINED] refines the threat T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA in
                         the Security IC PP [5].
                         The threat T.CONFIG is an additional threat to cover unauthorized modifications and
                         read access of the configuration area in the TOE. It is an addition to the threats defined in
                         the PP [6].
                         The threat T.SEC_BOX_BORDER is included for the Secure Box which is additional
                         functionality the PP [6] allows.
                         The threats T.MODULE_EXEC and T.MODULE_REPLACEMENT are included for the
                         Modular Design which is additional functionality the PP [6] allows. Furthermore some
                         threats from the PP [6] are refined to cover additional assets from the Modular Design.
                         This comprises threats T.CONFID-JCS-CODE, T.CONFID-JCS-DATA, T.INTEG-APPLI-
                         CODE, T.INTEG-JCS-CODE, T.INTEG-JCS-DATA, and T.SID.1.
                         Note that the threat T.EXE-CODE-REMOTE is not included, since the TOE does not
                         support Java Card RMI. The Java Card Protection Profile [6] makes the use of Java Card
                         RMI optional.

                        The OSP OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS is introduced for the SD feature of the TOE and is
                        an addition to the OSPs in PP [6].
                        The OSP.SECURE-BOX is introduced to allow execution of third party native code and is
                        an addition to the OSPs in PP [6].

                 2.4.2.3 Assumptions

                        The SPD statement includes two of the three assumptions from the PP [6]. The
                        assumption A.Deletion is excluded. The Card Manager is part of the TOE and therefore
                        the assumption is no longer relevant. Leaving out the assumption, makes the SPD of this
                        ST more restrictive than the SPD in the PP [6]. As the Card Manager is part of the TOE,
                        it is ensuring that the deletion of applets through the Card Manager is secure, instead of
                        assuming that it is handled by the Card Manager in the environment of the TOE.
                        Besides the assumptions from the PP [6], following additional assumptions are added:
                        •   A.PROCESS-SEC-IC
                        •   A.USE_DIAG
                        •   A.USE_KEYS
                        •   A.APPS-PROVIDER
                        •   A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY
                        The assumption A.PROCESS-SEC-IC is taken from the underlying certified Micro
                        Controller [10], which is compliant to the Security IC PP [5].
                        The assumptions A.USE_DIAG and A.USE_KEYS are included because the Card
                        Manager is part of the TOE and no longer part of the environment.
                        The assumptions A.APPS-PROVIDER and A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY are added
                        because Security Domains from the GlobalPlatform Specification are introduced. All the
                        applets and packages are signed by the Application Provider Security Domain (APSD)
                        and the correctness is verified on the TOE by Verification Authority Security Domain
                        (VASD) before the package or applet is installed or loaded. A.APPS-PROVIDER and
                        A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY are additions to PP [6] for card content management
                        environment.

                  2.4.3 Security Objectives Statement
                        The statement of security objectives in the ST presented in Section 5 "Security
                        Objectives" includes all security objectives as presented in the PP [6], but also includes a
                        number of additional security objectives. These security objectives are:
                        • OT.IDENTIFICATION
                        • OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS
                        • OT.APPLI-AUTH

                      •   OT.SECURE_LOAD_ACODE
                      •   OT.SECURE_ACTIVATION_ADDITIONAL_CODE
                      •   OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION
                      The security objective OT.IDENTIFICATION is part of the security objectives of the
                      certified Micro Controller [10] (see also Section 1.3.1.1 "Micro Controller") and Crypto
                      Lib [10] (see also Section 1.3.1.2.2 "Crypto Library"), which are also components of this
                      composite certification. Therefore the security objective statement is equivalent to the PP
                      [6] for these two security objectives. OT.IDENTIFICATION is also included for the pre-
                      personalisation feature of the TOE, which is additional functionality the PP allows.
                      The security objectives OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS, OT.APPLI-AUTH, OT.COMM_AUTH,
                      OT.COMM_INTEGRITY, OT.COMM_CONFIDENTIALITY are objectives for the TOE as
                      the GlobalPlatform API and the definitions for Secure Channel, Security Domains and
                      Card Content Management are used from it.
                      The security objectives OT.CARD-CONFIGURATION, OT.SECURE_LOAD_ACODE,
                      OT.SECURE_ACTIVATION_ADDITIONAL_CODE, OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION are
                      related to the configuration of the TOE via the Configuration Module, which is additional
                      functionality the PP [6] allows.
                      The security objective OT.SEC_BOX_FW is related to the Secure Box, which is
                      additional functionality the PP allows.
                      The security objective OT.SID_MODULE is related to the Modular Design of the TOE,
                      which is additional functionality the PP [6] allows.
                      The security objective OT.RNG is related to the Random Number Generator, and is
                      taken from the Security IC PP [5].
                      The ST contains OE.APPLET, OE.VERIFICATION and OE.CODE-EVIDENCE from
                      Security Objectives for the Operational Environment from [6]. Additionally, some of the
                      Security Objectives for the Operational Environment from [6] are listed as TOE Security
                      Objectives in this ST:
                      •   OT.SCP.RECOVERY instead of OE.SCP.RECOVERY
                      •   OT.SCP.SUPPORT instead of OE.SCP.SUPPORT
                      •   OT.SCP.IC instead of OE.SCP.IC
                      •   OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT instead of OE.CARD-MANAGEMENT
                      OT.SCP.RECOVERY, OT.SCP.SUPPORT, and OT.SCP.IC are objectives for the
                      TOE as the Smart Card Platform belongs to the TOE for this evaluation. OT.CARD-
                      MANAGEMENT is an objective for the TOE as the Card Manager belongs to the TOE
                      for this evaluation. Moving objectives from the environment to the TOE adds objectives
                      to the TOE without changing the overall objectives. The statement of security objectives
                      is therefore equivalent to the security objectives in the PP [6] to which conformance is
                      claimed.

                       The security objectives O.INSTALL, O.LOAD, and O.DELETION from the PP [6] are not
                       included since these functionality and objectives are covered by the refined OT.CARD-
                       MANAGEMENT.
                       Note that the objective O.REMOTE is not included, since the TOE does not support Java
                       Card RMI. The Java Card Protection Profile makes the use of Java Card RMI optional.
                       A part of the security objectives for the environment defined in the PP [6] has been
                       included in this ST. The other part of security objectives for the environment, which is
                       present in the PP [6], is used as part of the security objectives for the TOE in this ST. The
                       ST also introduces following additional security objectives for the environment:
                       •   OE.PROCESS_SEC_IC
                       •   OE.USE_DIAG
                       •   OE.USE_KEYS
                       •   OE.APPS-PROVIDER
                       •   OE.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY
                       •   OE.KEY-CHANGE
                       •   OE.SECURITY-DOMAINS
                       The security objective for the environment OE.PROCESS_SEC_IC is from the hardware
                       platform (Micro Controller [10] see also Section 1.3.1.1 "Micro Controller") that is part of
                       this composite product evaluation. Therefore the statement of security objectives for the
                       environment is equivalent to the statement in the Security IC PP [5].
                       OE.USE_KEYS and OE.USE_DIAG are included because the Card Manager is part of
                       the TOE and not a security objective for the environment as in PP [6].
                       OE.APPS-PROVIDER and OE.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY cover trusted actors which
                       enable the creation, distribution and verification of secure applications.
                       OE.KEY-CHANGE covers the switch to trusted keys for the AP.
                       OE.SECURITY-DOMAINS covers the management of security domains in the context of
                       the GlobalPlatform Specification.
                       The statement of security objectives for the environment is therefore considered to be
                       equivalent to the security objectives in the PP [6] to which conformance is claimed.

                 2.4.4 Security Functional Requirements Statement
                       The statement of security functional requirements copies most SFRs as defined in the
                       PP [6], with the exception of a number of options. For the copied set of SFRs the ST is
                       considered equivalent to the statement of SFRs in the PP [6]. Moreover as requested
                       by the PP [6] the ST adds additional threats, objectives and SFRs to fully cover and
                       describe additional security functionality implemented in the TOE.
                       The TOE does not implement Java Card RMI, therefore this ST restricts remote access
                       from the CAD to the services implemented by the applets on the card to none. As a
                       result the SFRs concerning Java Card RMI (FDP_ACF.1/JCRMI, FDP_IFC.1/JCRMI,
                       FDP_IFF.1/JCRMI, FMT_MSA.1/EXPORT, FMT_MSA.1/REM_ REFS, FMT_MSA.3/
                       JCRMI, FMT_SMF.1/JCRMI, FMT_REV.1/JCRMI, and FMT_SMR.1/JCRMI) are not
                       included in the ST. In the PP [6] the use of the Java Card RMI is optional.
                       The SFR FDP_ITC.2/INSTALLER from the PP [6] is replaced by FDP_ITC.2[CCM] which
                       enforces the Security Domain access control policy and the Secure Channel Protocol
                       information flow policy and which are more restrictive than the PACKAGE LOADING
                       information flow control SFP from PP [6].

                      The set of SFRs that define the card content management mechanism CarG are partly
                      replaced or refined and are considered to be equivalent or more restrictive because of
                      the newly introduced SFPs:
                      1. Security Domain access control policy,
                      2. Secure Channel Protocol information flow policy
                      provide a concrete and more restrictive implementation of the PACKAGE LOADING
                      information flow control SFP from PP [6].
                      The table below lists the SFRs from CarG of PP [6] and their corresponding refinements

                      The following SFRs realize refinements of SFRs from PP [6] and add functionality to the

                      FDP_ROL.1[CCM] and FPT_FLS.1[CCM] realize additional security functionality for the

3       Security Aspects
                       This Chapter describes the main security issues of the Java Card System and its
                       environment addressed in this ST, called "security aspects", in a CC-independent way.
                       In addition to this, they also give a semi-formal framework to express the CC security
                       environment and objectives of the TOE. They can be instantiated as assumptions,
                       threats, objectives (for the TOE and the environment) or organizational security policies.
                       The description is based on [6].
                       This chapters described only the Security Aspects which have been added in comparison
                       to the PP [6].

                  3.1 Integrity

                 3.1.1 SA.INTEG-APPLI-DATA-PHYS: Integrity of Application Data (Sensitive
                       Result)
                       Integrity-sensitive application data must be protected against unauthorized modification
                       by physical attacks.

                  3.2 Configuration Module

                 3.2.1 SA.CONFIGURATION-MODULE: Configuration Module
                       The Configuration Module is a JCOP functionality which allows to read and modify
                       configuration items in the configuration area of the TOE.

                  3.3 Modular Design

                 3.3.1 SA.MODULAR-DESIGN: Modular Design
                       The TOE might contain one or more Modules implementing particular functionality. The
                       list of Modules present in the TOE must be retrievable. The Modules have an associated
                       AID which allows to identify them. The AID is equivalent to the Package AID of JavaCard
                       packages. Modules can only be deleted, re-loading of a previously deleted module or
                       replacing a present module must not be possible. Interfaces to a Module can be Public
                       or TOE internal. Public Interfaces can directly be accessed by any Applet or via an
                       APDU, TOE internal interfaces can only be accessed by the TOE itself, Applets use the
                       corresponding JavaCard API [14].

                 3.3.2 SA.MODULE-INVOCATION: Module Invocation
                       Invoking a module must be transparent to the user. If a Module has a TOE internal
                       interface, is not present and is invoked by the user, the TOE must preserve a secure
                       state by throwing an exception or returning an appropriate error status word to the CAD.

4       Security Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)
                       The Security Problem Definition is described within the following sections. Only additional
                       and refined items compared to the PP [6] are described.

                  4.1 Assets
                       Assets are security-relevant elements to be directly protected by the TOE. Confidentiality
                       of assets is always intended with respect to un-trusted people or software, as various
                       parties are involved during the first stages of the smart card product life-cycle. Details
                       concerning the threats are given in Section 4.2 "Threats" hereafter.
                       Assets have to be protected, some in terms of confidentiality and some in terms of
                       integrity or both integrity and confidentiality. These assets might get compromised by the
                       threats that the TOE is exposed to.
                       The assets to be protected by the TOE are listed below. They are grouped according to
                       whether it is data created by and for the user (User data) or data created by and for the
                       TOE (TSF data). This definition of grouping is taken from Section 5.1 of [6].

                                                          with the AP. These keys can be used to load and install applications
                                                          on the card if the Security Domain has the appropriate privileges. To
                                                          be protected from unauthorized disclosure and modification.

                                                          cryptographic keys are needed to perform card management
                                                          operations on the card. To be protected from unauthorized disclosure
                                                          and modification.

                                                          unauthorized modification.


                 4.1.2 TSF Data

                       D.CONFIG_ITEM                 A configuration that can be changed using the Configuration Mechanism.

                 4.2.1.1 T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA[REFINED]: Integrity of Application Data

                        The attacker executes an application to alter (part of) another application’s data.
                        Directly threatened asset(s): D.APP_I_ DATA, D.PIN, D.APP_KEYS, D.ISD_KEYS,
                        D.VASD_KEYS and S.APSD_KEYS.
                        This threat is a refinement of the Threat T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA from [6].

                  4.2.2 Unauthorized Execution

                 4.2.2.1 T.MODULE_EXEC: Code Execution of Modules

                        The attacker bypasses the presence check of a Module which is not present with
                        TOE internal interface to execute arbitrary code. See SA.MODULAR-DESIGN and
                        SA.MODULE-INVOCATION for details. Directly threatened asset(s): D.MODULE_
                        CODE.

                  4.2.3 Card Management

                 4.2.3.1 T.UNAUTHORIZED_CARD_MNGT: Unauthorized Card Management

                        The attacker performs unauthorized card management operations (for instance
                        impersonates one of the actor represented on the card) in order to take benefit of the
                        privileges or services granted to this actor on the card such as fraudulent:
                        •   load of a package file
                        •   installation of a package file
                        •   extradition of a package file or an applet
                        •   personalization of an applet or a Security Domain
                        •   deletion of a package file or an applet
                        •   privileges update of an applet or a Security Domain
                        Directly threatened asset(s): D.ISD_KEYS, D.APSD_KEYS, D.APP_C_DATA, D.APP_
                        I_DATA, D.APP_CODE, D.SEC_DATA, and D.CARD_MNGT_DATA (any other asset
                        may be jeopardized should this attack succeed, depending on the virulence of the
                        installed application).
                        This security objective is a refinement of the Threats T.INSTALL and T.DELETION from
                        [6].

                 4.2.3.2 T.COM_EXPLOIT: Communication Channel Remote Exploit

                        An attacker remotely exploits the communication channels established between a third
                        party and the TOE in order to modify or disclose confidential data.

                  4.2.4 Operating System

                 4.2.4.1 T.OS_OPERATE: Incorrect Operating System Behavior

                        Modification of the correct OS behavior by unauthorized use of TOE or use of incorrect
                        or unauthorized instructions or commands or sequence of commands, in order to obtain
                        an unauthorized execution of the TOE code. An attacker may cause a malfunction of TSF
                        or of the Smart Card embedded OS in order to (1) by-pass the security mechanisms (i.e.
                        authentication or access control mechanisms) or (2) obtain unexpected result from the
                        embedded OS behavior. Different kind of attack path may be used as:
                        1. Applying incorrect unexpected or unauthorized instructions, commands or command
                           sequences,
                        2. Provoking insecure state by insertion of interrupt (reset), premature termination of
                           transaction or communication between IC and the reading device.
                        Info: Any implementation flaw in the OS itself can be exploited with this attack path
                        to lead to an unsecured state of the state machine of the OS. The attacker uses the
                        available interfaces of the TOE. A user could have certain specified privileges that allow
                        loading of selected programs. Unauthorized programs, if allowed to be loaded, may
                        include either the execution of legitimate programs not intended for use during normal
                        operation (such as patches, filters, Trojan horses, etc.) or the unauthorized loading of
                        programs specifically targeted at penetration or modification of the security functions.
                        Attempts to generate a non-secure state in the Smart Card may also be made through
                        premature termination of transactions or communications between the IC and the card
                        reading device, by insertion of interrupts, or by selecting related applications that may
                        leave files open.

                  4.2.5 Random Numbers

                 4.2.5.1 T.RND: Deficiency of Random Numbers

                        An attacker may predict or obtain information about random numbers generated by
                        the TOE for instance because of a lack of entropy of the random numbers provided.
                        An attacker may gather information about the produced random numbers which might
                        be a problem because they may be used for instance to generate cryptographic keys.
                        Here the attacker is expected to take advantage of statistical properties of the random
                        numbers generated by the TOE without specific knowledge about the TOE’s generator.
                        Malfunctions or premature ageing are also considered which may assist in getting
                        information about random numbers.

                        An attacker may try to use malicious code placed in the Secure Box to modify the correct
                        behavior of the Operating System (OS). With the aim to
                        1. disclose the Java Card System code,

                        An attacker loads a Module with functionality differing from a previously deleted Module
                        to bypass TOE Security Functions. See SA.MODULAR-DESIGN for details. Directly
                        threatened assets: D.JCS_DATA.

                   4.3 Organisational Security Policies

                  4.3.1 OSP.PROCESS-TOE: Identification of the TOE
                        An accurate identification must be established for the TOE. This requires that each
                        instantiation of the TOE carries this identification.

                  4.3.2 OSP.KEY-CHANGE: Security Domain Keys Change
                        The Application Provider (AP) shall change its initial security domain keys (APSD) before
                        any operation on its Security Domain.

                  4.3.3 OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS: Security Domains
                        Security domains can be dynamically created, deleted and blocked during usage phase
                        in post-issuance mode.

                  4.3.4 OSP.SECURE-BOX: Secure Box Border
                        Execution of untrusted native code shall be possible without any harm, manipulation, or
                        influence on other parts of the TOE.

                   4.4 Assumptions
                        Note that the assumption A.DELETION is excluded. The Card Manager is part of the
                        TOE and therefore the assumption is no longer relevant.

                 4.4.2 A.USE_KEYS: Protected Storage of Keys Outside of TOE
                       It is assumed that the keys which are stored outside the TOE and which are used for
                       secure communication and authentication between Smart Card and terminals are
                       protected for confidentiality and integrity in their own storage environment. This is
                       especially true for D.APSD_KEYS, D.ISD_KEYS, and D.VASD_KEYS.
                       Info: This is to assume that the keys used in terminals or systems are correctly
                       protected for confidentiality and integrity in their own environment, as the disclosure of
                       such information which is shared with the TOE but is not under the TOE control, may
                       compromise the security of the TOE.

                 4.4.3 A.PROCESS-SEC-IC: Protection during Packaging, Finishing and
                       Personalisation
                       It is assumed that security procedures are used after delivery of the TOE by the TOE
                       Manufacturer up to delivery to the end consumer to maintain confidentiality and integrity
                       of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test data (to prevent any possible copy,
                       modification, retention, theft or unauthorised use). This means that the Phases after TOE
                       Delivery are assumed to be protected appropriately.
                       The assets to be protected are: The information and material produced and/or processed
                       by the Security IC Embedded Software Developer in Phase 1 and by the Composite
                       Product Manufacturer can be grouped as follows:
                       1. the Security IC Embedded Software including specifications, implementation and
                          related documentation,
                       2. pre-personalisation and personalisation data including specifications of formats and
                          memory areas, test related data,
                       3. the User Data and related documentation, and
                       4. material for software development support
                       as long as they are not under the control of the TOE Manufacturer.

                 4.4.4 A.APPS-PROVIDER: Application Provider
                       The AP is a trusted actor that provides basic or secure applications. He is responsible for
                       his security domain keys (APSD keys).
                       Info: An AP generally refers to the entity that issues the application. For instance it can
                       be a financial institution for a payment application such as EMV or a transport operator
                       for a transport application.

                 4.4.5 A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY: Verification Authority
                       The VA is a trusted actor who is able to guarantee and check the digital signature
                       attached to a basic or secure application.
                       Info: As a consequence, it guarantees the success of the application validation upon
                       loading.

5       Security Objectives
                        The Security Objectives for the TOE, for the operational environment and the security
                        objectives rationale are described within the following sections. Only additional and
                        refined items compared to the PP [6] are described.

                   5.1 Security Objectives for the TOE

                  5.1.1 Identification

                 5.1.1.1 OT.SID_MODULE: Subject Identification of Modules

                        The TOE shall uniquely identify every Module before granting it access to any service.

                  5.1.2 Execution

                 5.1.2.1 OT.SENSITIVE_RESULTS_INTEG: Sensitive Result

                        The TOE shall ensure that the sensitive results
                        (com.nxp.id.jcopx.security.SensitiveResultX) of sensitive operations executed by
                        applications through the Java Card API are protected in integrity specifically against
                        physical attacks.

                  5.1.3 Services

                 5.1.3.1 OT.RNG: Random Numbers Generation

                        The TOE shall ensure the cryptographic quality of random number generation. For
                        instance random numbers shall not be predictable and shall have sufficient entropy. The
                        TOE shall ensure that no information about the produced random numbers is available to
                        an attacker since they might be used for instance to generate cryptographic keys.

                  5.1.4 Applet Management

                 5.1.4.1 OT.APPLI-AUTH: Application Authentication

                        The card manager shall enforce the application security policies established by the card
                        issuer by requiring application authentication during application loading on the card. This
                        security objective is a refinement of the Security Objective O.LOAD from [6].
                        AppNote: Each application loaded onto the TOE has been signed by a VA. The VA
                        will guarantee that the security policies established by the card issuer on applications
                        are enforced. For example this authority (DAP) or a third party (Mandated DAP) can
                        be present on the TOE as a Security Domain whose role is to verify each signature at
                        application loading.

                 5.1.4.2 OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS: Domain Rights

                        The Card issuer shall not get access or change personalized AP Security Domain keys
                        which belong to the AP. Modification of a Security Domain keyset is restricted to the AP
                        who owns the security domain.

                        AppNote: APs have a set of keys that allows them to establish a secure channel between
                        them and the platform. These keys sets are not known by the TOE issuer. The security
                        domain initial keys are changed before any operation on the SD (OE.KEY-CHANGE).

                        The TOE shall authenticate the origin of the card management requests that the card
                        receives, and authenticate itself to the remote actor.

                 5.1.4.4 OT.COMM_INTEGRITY: Communication Request Integrity

                        The TOE shall verify the integrity of the card management requests that the card
                        receives.

                 5.1.4.5 OT.COMM_CONFIDENTIALITY: Communication Request Confidentiality

                        The TOE shall be able to process card management requests containing encrypted data.

                  5.1.5 Card Management

                 5.1.5.1 OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT: Card Management

                        The TOE shall provide card management functionalities (loading, installation, extradition,
                        deletion of applications and GP registry updates) in charge of the life cycle of the whole
                        device and installed applications (applets). The card manager, the application with
                        specific rights responsible for the administration of the smart card, shall control the
                        access to card management functions. It shall also implement the card issuer’s policy on
                        card management.
                        The Security Objective from [6] for the environment OE.CARD-MANAGEMENT is listed
                        as TOE Security Objective OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT for the TOE as the Card Manager
                        belongs to the TOE for this evaluation. This security objective is a refinement for the
                        Security Objectives O.INSTALL, O.LOAD, and O.DELETION from [6]. Thus, the following
                        objectives are also covered:
                        • The TOE shall ensure that the installation of an applet performs as expected (See
                          SA.INSTALL for details).
                        • The TOE shall ensure that the loading of a package into the card is secure.
                        • The TOE shall ensure that the deletion of a package from the TOE is secure.
                        AppNote: The card manager will be tightly connected in practice with the rest of the TOE,
                        which in return shall very likely rely on the card manager for the effective enforcement
                        of some of its security functions. The mechanism used to ensure authentication of
                        the TOE issuer, that manages the TOE, or of the Service Providers owning a Security
                        Domain with card management privileges is a secure channel. This channel will be
                        used afterwards to protect commands exchanged with the TOE in confidentiality and
                        integrity. The platform guarantees that only the ISD or the Service Providers owning a
                        Security Domain with the appropriate privilege (Delegated Management) can manage the
                        applications on the card associated with its Security Domain. This is done accordingly
                        with the card issuer’s policy on card management. The actor performing the operation
                        must beforehand authenticate with the Security Domain. In the case of Delegated
                        Management, the card management command will be associated with an electronic
                        signature (GlobalPlatform token) verified by the ISD before execution.
                        The Security Objective from [6] for the environment OE.CARD-MANAGEMENT is listed
                        as TOE Security Objective OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT for the TOE as the Card Manager

                         belongs to the TOE for this evaluation. This security objective is a refinement for the
                         Security Objectives O.INSTALL, O.LOAD, and O.DELETION from [6]. Thus, the following
                         AppNote applicable to O.DELETION applies also:
                         • Usurpation of identity resulting from a malicious installation of an applet on the card
                           may also be the result of perturbing the communication channel linking the CAD and
                           the card. Even if the CAD is placed in a secure environment, the attacker may try to
                           capture, duplicate, permute or modify the packages sent to the card. He may also try to
                           send one of its own applications as if it came from the card issuer. Thus, this objective
                           is intended to ensure the integrity and authenticity of loaded CAP files.

                  5.1.6 Smart Card Platform

                 5.1.6.1 OT.SCP.IC IC: Physical Protection

                         The SCP shall provide all IC security features against physical attacks. This security
                         objective for the environment refers to the point (7) of the security aspect SA.SCP.
                         AppNote: The Security Objectives from [6] for the environment OE.SCP.RECOVERY,
                         OE.SCP.SUPPORT, and OE.SCP.IC are listed as TOE Security Objectives
                         (OT.SCP.RECOVERY, OT.SCP.SUPPORT, and OT.SCP.IC) for the TOE in this section
                         as the Smart Card Platform belongs to the TOE for this evaluation.

                 5.1.6.2 OT.SCP.RECOVERY: SCP Recovery

                         If there is a loss of power, or if the smart card is withdrawn from the CAD while an
                         operation is in progress, the SCP must allow the TOE to eventually complete the
                         interrupted operation successfully, or recover to a consistent and secure state. This
                         security objective for the environment refers to the security aspect SA.SCP.
                         AppNote: The Security Objectives from [6] for the environment OE.SCP.RECOVERY,
                         OE.SCP.SUPPORT, and OE.SCP.IC are listed as TOE Security Objectives

                 5.1.6.3 OT.SCP.SUPPORT: SCP Support

                         The SCP shall support the TSFs of the TOE. This security objective refers to the security
                         aspects 2, 3, 4 and 5 of SA.SCP.
                         AppNote: The Security Objectives from [6] for the environment OE.SCP.RECOVERY,

                 5.1.6.4 OT.IDENTIFICATION: TOE identification

                         The TOE must provide means to store Initialization Data and Pre-personalization Data
                         in its non-volatile memory. The Initialization Data (or parts of them) are used for TOE
                         identification.

                  5.1.7 Secure Box

                 5.1.7.1 OT.SEC_BOX_FW: SecureBox firewall

                        The TOE shall provide separation between the Secure Box native code and the Java
                        Card System. The separation shall comprise software execution and data access.

                  5.1.8 Configuration Module

                 5.1.8.1 OT.CARD-CONFIGURATION: Card Configuration

                        The TOE shall ensure that the customer can only configure customer configuration items
                        and that NXP can configure customer and NXP configuration items.

                 5.1.8.2 OT.SECURE_LOAD_ACODE: Secure loading of the Additional Code

                        This objective is taken over from [8].
                        The Loader of the Initial TOE shall check an evidence of authenticity and integrity of the
                        loaded Additional Code.
                        The Loader enforces that only the allowed version of the Additional Code can be loaded
                        on the Initial TOE. The Loader shall forbid the loading of an Additional Code not intended
                        to be assembled with the Initial TOE.
                        During the Load Phase of an Additional Code, the TOE shall remain secure.

                 5.1.8.3 OT.SECURE_ACTIVATION_ADDITIONAL_CODE: Secure activation of the
                         Additional Code

                        This objective is taken over from [8] (O.Secure_AC_Activation) with editorial modification.
                        Activation of the Additional Code and update of the Identification Data shall be performed
                        at the same time in an Atomic way.
                        All the operations needed for the code to be able to operate as in the Final TOE shall be
                        completed before activation.
                        If the Atomic Activation is successful, then the resulting product is the Final TOE,
                        otherwise (in case of interruption or incident which prevents the forming of the Final
                        TOE), the Initial TOE shall remain in its initial state or fail secure.

                 5.1.8.4 OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION: Secure identification of the TOE

                        This objective is taken over from [8] and further refined.
                        The Identification Data identifies the Initial TOE and Additional Code. The TOE provides
                        means to store Identification Data in its non-volatile memory and guarantees the integrity
                        of these data.
                        After Atomic Activation of the Additional Code, the Identification Data of the Final TOE
                        allows identifications of Initial TOE and Additional Code or the Final TOE. The user shall
                        be able to uniquely identify Initial TOE and Additional Code(s) or the final TOE which are
                        embedded in the Final TOE.

                  5.2 Security Objectives for the Operational Environment

                 5.2.1 OE.APPS-PROVIDER: Application Provider
                      The AP shall be a trusted actor that provides applications. The AP is responsible for its
                      security domain keys.

                 5.2.2 OE.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY: Verification Authority
                      The VA should be a trusted actor who is able to verify bytecode of an application loaded
                      on the card, guarantee and generate the digital signature attached to an application and
                      ensure that its public key for verifying the application signature is on the TOE.

                 5.2.3 OE.PROCESS_SEC_IC: Protection during composite product
                       manufacturing
                      Security procedures shall be used after TOE Delivery up to delivery to the end-consumer
                      to maintain confidentiality and integrity of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test
                      data (to prevent any possible copy, modification, retention, theft or unauthorised use).
                      This means that Phases after TOE Delivery up to the end of Phase 6 must be protected
                      appropriately.

                 5.2.4 OE.KEY-CHANGE: Security Domain Key Change
                      The AP must change its security domain initial keys before any operation on it.

                 5.2.5 OE.SECURITY-DOMAINS: Security Domains
                      Security domains can be dynamically created, deleted and blocked during usage phase
                      in post-issuance mode.

                 5.2.6 OE.USE_DIAG: Secure TOE communication protocols
                      Secure TOE communication protocols shall be supported and used by the environment.

                 5.2.7 OE.USE_KEYS: Protection of OPE keys
                      During the TOE usage, the terminal or system in interaction with the TOE shall ensure
                      the protection (integrity and confidentiality) of their own keys by operational means and/or
                      procedures.

                  5.3 Security Objectives Rationale
                      In this section it is proven that the security objectives described in Section 4 "Security
                      Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)" can be traced for all aspects identified in the TOE-
                      security environment and that they are suited to cover them. At least one security
                      objective results from each assumption, OSP, and each threat. At least one threat, one
                      OSP or assumption exists for each security objective.

                      The component FCS_RNG is taken over from the Java Card PP [6]. In addition following
                      components are defined for the TOE.

                      To define the security functional requirements of the TOE an additional family
                      (FAU_SAS) of the Class FAU (Security Audit) is defined here. This family describes the
                      functional requirements for the storage of audit data. It has a more general approach
                      than FAU_GEN, because it does not necessarily require the data to be generated by
                      the TOE itself and because it does not give specific details of the content of the audit
                      records.
                      The family “Audit data storage (FAU_SAS)” is specified as follows.

                      The TOE shall prevent attacks against the TOE and other secret data where the attack
                      is based on external observable physical phenomena of the TOE. Examples of such
                      attacks are evaluation of TOE’s electromagnetic radiation, simple power analysis (SPA),
                      differential power analysis (DPA), timing attacks, etc. This family describes the functional
                      requirements for the limitation of intelligible emanations which are not directly addressed
                      by any other component of CC part 2 [2].

                      [1]   Applicable only if the corresponding module for the cryptographic operation is present in the TOE.
                      [2]   Due to mathematical weakness only resistant against AVA_VAN.5 for temporary data (e.g. as used for generating session
                            keys), but not if repeatedly applied to the same input data.
                      [3]   Available only in the IOT Full variant of the TOE and not on the IOT Reduced variant. See Section 1.3.3 "TOE Reduced
                            Feature Set" for details.

                      For resistance against attackers with High Attack Potential the user should always
                      refer to the guidance given by the Certification Body in the jurisdiction. The website
                      www.keylength.com provides a good reference to recommended key lengths.

                                                           that security functional requirements are enforced. Hence,
                                                           ”automatic response” means here (i) assuming that there might

                 7.5.1 Rationale for Exclusion of Dependencies
                       The dependency FIA_UID.1 of FMT_SMR.1[INSTALLER] is unsupported. This ST
                       does not require the identification of the "Installer" since it can be considered as part of
                       the TSF.
                       The dependency FIA_UID.1 of FMT_SMR.1[ADEL] is unsupported. This ST does not
                       require the identification of the "applet deletion manager" since it can be considered as
                       part of the TSF.
                       The dependency FIA_UID.1 of FMT_SMR.1[MODULAR-DESIGN] is unsupported.
                       This ST does not require the identification of the "Module Invoker" since it can be
                       considered as part of the TSF.
                       The dependency FMT_SMF.1 of FMT_MSA.1[JCRE] is unsupported. The
                       dependency between FMT_MSA.1[JCRE] and FMT_SMF.1 is not satisfied because no
                       management functions are required for the Java Card RE.
                       The dependency FAU_SAA.1 of FAU_ARP.1 is unsupported. The dependency of
                       FAU_ARP.1 on FAU_SAA.1 assumes that a "potential security violation" generates
                       an audit event. On the contrary, the events listed in FAU_ARP.1 are self-contained
                       (arithmetic exception, ill-formed bytecodes, access failure) and ask for a straightforward
                       reaction of the TSFs on their occurrence at runtime. The JCVM or other components
                       of the TOE detect these events during their usual working order. Thus, there is no
                       mandatory audit recording in this ST.
                       The dependency FIA_UAU.1 of FIA_AFL.1[PIN] is unsupported. The TOE
                       implements the firewall access control SFP, based on which access to the object
                       Implementing FIA_AFL.1[PIN] is organized.
                       The dependencies FMT_SMR.1 of FMT_MSA.1[SecureBox] and
                       FMT_MSA.3[SecureBox] are unsupported. Only S.JCRE is allowed to modify security
                       attributes for the Secure Box before S.SBNativeCode is executed. Furthermore the TOE
                       does not allow to specify alternative initial values for the security attributes of the Secure
                       Box.

                 7.6 Security Assurance Requirements Rationale
                      The selection of assurance components is based on the underlying PP [6]. The Security
                      Target uses the augmentations from the PP, chooses EAL6 and adds the components
                      ASE_TSS.2 and ALC_FLR.1.
                      The rationale for the augmentations is the same as in the PP.
                      The assurance level EAL6 is an elaborated pre-defined level of the CC, Part 3 [3]. The
                      assurance components in an EAL level are chosen in a way that they build a mutually
                      supportive and complete set of components.
                      The additional requirements chosen for augmentation do not add any dependencies,
                      which are not already fulfilled for the corresponding requirements contained in EAL6.
                      Therefore, the components ASE_TSS.2 and ALC_FLR.1 add additional assurance to
                      EAL6, but the mutual support of the requirements is still guaranteed.

                  8.1 Introduction
                       The Security Functions (SF) introduced in this section realize the SFRs of the TOE.
                       See Table 18 "Overview of Security Functions" for list of all Security Functions. Each
                       SF consists of components spread over several TOE components to provide a security
                       functionality and fulfill SFRs.

                       security attributes are initialized and assigned by the system itself which fulfills
                       FMT_MSA.2[FIREWALL-JCVM], FMT_MSA.3[FIREWALL] , and FMT_MSA.3[JCVM].
                       SF.JCVM ensures together with SF.PERS_MEM that the system is halted in case
                       non existing Java objects could be referenced after an aborted transaction to fulfill
                       FDP_RIP.1[ABORT].

                 8.2.2 SF.CONFIG: Configuration Management
                       SF.CONFIG provides means to store Initialization Data and Pre-personalization Data
                       before TOE delivery FAU_SAS.1[SCP].
                       SF.CONFIG provides means to change configuration items of the card. Some
                       configuration items can be changed by the customer and some can only be changed
                       by NXP (FDP_IFC.2[CFG], FDP_IFF.1[CFG] , FMT_MSA.3[CFG], FMT_MSA.1[CFG],
                       FMT_SMR.1[CFG], FMT_SMF.1[CFG], FIA_UID.1[CFG]). SF.CONFIG supports
                       FCS_COP.1 by configuring the behavior of cryptographic operations.

                 8.2.3 SF.OPEN: Card Content Management
                       SF.OPEN provides the card content management functionality according the
                       GlobalPlatform Specification [17]. This supports FCO_NRO.2[SC], FDP_ACC.1[SD],
                       FDP_ACF.1[SD], FDP_UIT.1[CCM], FDP_IFC.2[SC], FDP_IFF.1[SC], FDP_IFC.2[SC],

                       FIA_UAU.1[SC], FIA_UAU.4[SC], and FTP_ITC.1[SC]. In addition to the GP
                       specification, the Java Card Runtime Environment specification [16] is followed to
                       support FDP_ACC.2[ADEL], FDP_ACF.1[ADEL], FMT_MSA.3[SC], FMT_MSA.3[SD],
                       FMT_MTD.1[JCRE], FMT_MTD.3[JCRE], FPT_FLS.1[INSTALLER], FDP_RIP.1[bArray],
                       FDP_RIP.1[ADEL], FPT_TDC.1, FPT_FLS.1[ADEL], and FPT_FLS.1[CCM] for
                       application loading, installation, and deletion.
                       AID management is provided by SF.OPEN according to the GlobalPlatform Specification
                       [17], the Java Card Runtime Environment Specification [16], and the Java Card API
                       Specification [14] to support FIA_ATD.1[AID].
                       SF.OPEN is part of the TOE runtime environment and thus separated from other
                       applications to fulfill FMT_MSA.1[ADEL]. It supports FAU_ARP.1 and FPT_FLS.1 by
                       responding with error messages according to the GlobalPlatform mapping guidelines
                       [20] and fulfills FPT_RCV.3[INSTALLER] by inherent memory cleanup in case of aborted
                       loading and installation.

                 8.2.4 SF.CRYPTO: Cryptographic Functionality
                       SF.CRYPTO provides key creation, key management, key deletion and cryptographic
                       functionality. It provides the API in accordance to the Java Card API Specification
                       [14] to fulfill FCS_CKM.1, FCS_CKM.2, FCS_CKM.3, FCS_CKM.4, and FCS_COP.1.
                       Proprietary solutions (e.g., key lengths not supported by the Java Card API) are
                       supported following the Java Card API. SF.CRYPTO uses SF.DATA_STORAGE to
                       support FCS_CKM.1, FCS_CKM.2, FCS_CKM.3, FCS_CKM.4, FDP_RIP.1[KEYS],
                       and FDP_SDI.2[DATA]. The Crypto Lib certified with the TOE hardware supports

                 8.2.5 SF.RNG: Random Number Generator
                       SF.RNG provides secure random number generation to fulfill FCS_CKM.1 and
                       FCS_RNG.1. Random numbers are generated by the Crypto Lib certified with the TOE
                       hardware. SF.RNG provides an API according to the Java Card API Specification [14] to
                       generate random numbers according to FCS_RNG.1.

                 8.2.6 SF.DATA_STORAGE: Secure Data Storage
                       SF.DATA_STORAGE provides a secure data storage for confidential data. It is used
                       to store cryptographic keys (supports FCS_CKM.1, FCS_CKM.2, FCS_CKM.3,
                       and FCS_CKM.4) and to store PINs (supports FIA_AFL.1[PIN]). All data stored
                       by SF.DATA_STORAGE is CRC32 integrity protected to fulfill FDP_SDI.2[DATA],
                       FAU_ARP.1, and FPT_FLS.1. The stored data is AES encrypted to fulfill FPR_UNO.1.

                 8.2.7 SF.PUF: User Data Protection using PUF
                       SF.PUF implements a mechanism to seal/unseal the user data stored in shared
                       memory against unintended disclosure. SF.PUF encrypts/decrypts the user data with
                       a cryptographic key which is derived from the PUF data and stored directly in the
                       hardware. SF.PUF calculates a MAC as a PUF authentication value. SF.PUF serves
                       to seal/unseal the user data stored in the memory. The user data stored in the memory
                       can be encrypted/decrypted using the PUF block. A MAC (message authentication
                       code) can be calculated as a PUF authentication value. Hence, the user data can be
                       sealed within the TOE and can be solely unsealed by the TOE. The cryptographic key for
                       sealing/unsealing of the user data is generated with the help of a key derivation function
                       based on the PUF block and the Random Number Generator (RNG). The PUF block
                       provides the PUF data to the key derivation function and thereby the cryptographic key
                       is derived. If the TOE is powered off, the PUF data is not available from the PUF block.
                       Therefore SF.PUF is suitable to meet FCS_CKM.1.1[PUF] and FCS_CKM.4.1[PUF]. The
                       encryption/decryption of user data and the calculation of a MAC as a PUF authentication
                       value are performed within the AES coprocessor. Therefore SF.PUF is suitable to meet
                       FCS_COP.1.1[PUF_AES] and FCS_COP.1.1[PUF_MAC].

                 8.2.8 SF.OM: Java Object Management
                       SF.OM provides the object management for Java objects which are processed
                       by SF.JCVM. It provides object creation (FDP_RIP.1[OBJECTS]) and garbage
                       collection according to the Java Card Runtime Environment Specification [16] to fulfill
                       FDP_RIP.1[ODEL] and FPT_FLS.1[ODEL]. SF.OM throws an Java Exception in case
                       an object cannot be created as requested due to too less available memory. This fulfills
                       FAU_ARP.1 and FPT_FLS.1.

                 8.2.9 SF.MM: Memory Management
                       SF.MM provides deletion of memory for transient arrays, global arrays, and logical
                       channels according to the Java Card Runtime Environment Specification [16].
                       Thus, it fulfills FDP_RIP.1[TRANSIENT] by granting access to and erasing of
                       CLEAR_ON_RESET and CLEAR_ ON_DESELECT transient arrays. It supports
                       FIA_ATD.1[AID] when using logical channels and it fulfills FDP_RIP.1[APDU],
                       FDP_RIP.1[bArray] and FDP_RIP.1[GlobalArray_Refined] by clearing the APDU

                 8.2.10 SF.PIN: PIN Management
                        SF.PIN provides secure PIN management by using SF.DATA_STORAGE for PIN objects
                        specified in the Java Card API Specification [14] and the GlobalPlatform Specification
                        [17]. Thus, it fulfills FDP_SDI.2[DATA], FIA_AFL.1[PIN], and FPR_UNO.1.

                 8.2.11 SF.PERS_MEM: Persistent Memory Management
                        SF.PERS_MEM provides atomic write operations and transaction management
                        according to the Java Card Runtime Environment Specification [16]. This supports
                        FAU_ARP.1, FPT_FLS.1, and FDP_ROL.1[FIREWALL].
                        SF.PERS_MEM supports FDP_RIP.1[ABORT] together with SF.JCVM by halting the
                        system in case of object creation in aborted transactions.
                        Low level write routines to persistent memory in SF.PERS_MEM perform checks for
                        defect memory cells to fulfill FAU_ARP.1 and FPT_FLS.1.

                 8.2.12 SF.EDC: Error Detection Code API
                        SF.EDC provides an Java API for user applications to perform integrity checks based on
                        a checksum on Java arrays [9]. The API throws a Java Exception in case the checksum
                        in invalid. This supports FAU_ARP.1 and FPT_FLS.1.

                 8.2.13 SF.HW_EXC: Hardware Exception Handling
                        SF.HW_EXC provides software exception handler to react on unforeseen events
                        captured by the hardware (hardware exceptions). SF.HW_EXC catches the hardware
                        exceptions, to ensure the system goes to a secure state to fulfill FAU_ARP.1 and
                        FPT_FLS.1, as well as to increase the attack counter in order to resist physical
                        manipulation and probing to fulfill FPT_PHP.3.

                 8.2.14 SF.PID: Platform Identification
                        SF.PID provides a platform identifier. This platform identifier is generated during the card
                        image generation. The platform identifier contains IDs for:
                        • NVM content (stored during romizing)
                        • Patch Level (stored during romizing, can be changed during personalization if patch is
                          loaded)
                        • ROM code (stored during romizing)
                        • ROM code checksum (stored during romizing or during first TOE boot).
                        It identifies unambiguously the NVM and ROM part of the TOE. This feature supports
                        FAU_SAS.1[SCP] by using initialization data that is used for platform identification.

                 8.2.15 SF.SMG_NSC: No Side-Channel
                        The TSF ensures that during command execution there are no usable variations in
                        power consumption (measurable at e.g. electrical contacts) or timing (measurable at
                        e.g. electrical contacts) that might disclose cryptographic keys or PINs. All functions of
                        SF.CRYPTO except for SHA are resistant to side-channel attacks (e.g. timing attack,
                        SPA, DPA, DFA, EMA, DEMA) (see FPR_UNO.1 and FPT_EMSEC.1).

                 8.2.16 SF.ACC_SBX: Secure Box
                        SF.ACC_SBX provides an environment to securely execute non-certified native
                        code from third parties. SF.ACC_SBX ensures that only program code and data
                        contained in the secure box can be accessed from within this secure box and therefore
                        cannot harm, manipulate, or influence other parts of the TOE. This fulfills the SFRs
                        FDP_ACC.2[SecureBox], FDP_ACF.1[SecureBox] and FMT_MSA.1[SecureBox].
                        Native code executed in the Secure Box is executed in User Mode. Access to the CPU
                        mode, memory outside the Secure Box, the MMU segment table, and Special Function
                        Registers which allow configuration of the MMU and allow System Management is
                        prohibited for code executed in the Secure Box to fulfill FDP_ACF.1[SecureBox].
                        The MMU segment table to configure the MMU is part of the Secure Box which
                        fulfils FMT_MSA.3[SecureBox]. This MMU segment table can be modified during the
                        prepersonalization in accordance with FMT_MSA.3[SecureBox] to specify alternative
                        settings for initially restrictive values for the MMU segment table. This supports
                        FMT_SMF.1[SecureBox].

                 8.2.17 SF.MOD_INVOC: Module Invocation
                        SF.MOD_INVOC limits the invocation of code inside a Module to such Modules
                        whose security attribute Module Presence has the restrictive default value ”present”.
                        This fulfils the FMT_SMF.1[MODULAR-DESIGN], FMT_SMR.1[MODULAR-
                        DESIGN], FMT_MSA.3[MODULAR-DESIGN] and FIA_UID.1[MODULAR-DESIGN].
                        Limiting the invocation to defined subjects S.APPLET, S.SD and S.JCRE fulfils the
                        FDP_IFC.1[MODULAR-DESIGN] and FDP_IFF.1[MODULAR-DESIGN].
                        Throwing an exception in cases where the security attribute Module Presence
                        has the value ”not present” fulfils FPT_FLS.1[MODULAR-DESIGN]. Deletion of a
                        module may only be performed by S.ADEL which fulfils FMT_MSA.1[MODULAR-
                        DESIGN]. The Modules are identified by their associated unique AIDs, which fulfils
                        FIA_ATD.1[MODULAR-DESIGN] and FIA_USB.1[MODULAR-DESIGN] .

                 8.2.18 SF.SENS_RES: Sensitive Result
                        SF.SENS_RES ensures that sensitive methods of the Java Card API store their results
                        so that callers of these methods can assert their return values. If such a method returns
                        abnormally with an exception then the stored result is tagged as Unassigned and any
                        subsequent assertion of the result will fail. This fulfills FDP_SDI.2[SENSITIVE_RESULT].

                   8.3 Protection against Interference and Logical Tampering
                        The protection of the TOE against Interference and Logical Tampering is implemented in
                        software within the TOE and supported by the hardware of the micro controller.
                        The software protection of the TOE makes use of software security services which allow
                        to detect and react on manipulation of the TOE. Two types of reactions are used: If
                        invalid data from outside the TOE is detected then it is assumed that the TOE was used
                        in a wrong way. This is indicated by an appropriate Status Word or Exception. Detected
                        deviations from the physical operating conditions and inconsistencies of internal states
                        and program flow however are considered to be an attack to the TOE. In such cases an
                        internal Attack Counter is increased.
                        Typical software security mechanisms implemented in the TOE are e.g.:

                      • Complex patterned values are used instead of boolean values which are sensible to
                        tampering (only one bit needs to be changed to manipulate a false into a true.
                      • Small random delays are inserted in the program flow to make successful physical
                        interfering more difficult.
                      • Secret information like Keys or PINs are stored encrypted in the TOE. The Masterkey
                        to decrypt these is not accessible during normal operation.
                      • Critical data is read after it has been written to non volatile memory.
                      • Enhanced cryptographic support is based on the certified Crypto Lib for DES, AES,
                        RSA, ECC and random number generation.
                      • Critical values (like PINs) are compared timing-invariant. This prevents from side
                        channel attacks.
                      Further protection against Tampering and Logical Interference is realized by the MMU
                      implemented in hardware. The MMU is able to perform access control to all types of
                      memory and the special functions registers depending on the current operation.
                      The TOE defines several MMU contexts which restrict access to card internal
                      resources. The standard context used for normal operation has no access to the
                      cryptographic coprocessor. The context for cryptographic operation has no access to the
                      communication interfaces. One special context has write access to the Master Key in the
                      TOE. Afterwards the Master Keys can only be read, but only from a dedicated context
                      which is used to decrypt keys stored in the secure data store. In all other contexts the
                      Master Key is not accessible.
                      Additionally Interference and Logical Tampering is prevented by hardware security
                      services. JCOP 4 OS runs on a certified smart card HW platform which protects against
                      bypass by physical and logical means such as:
                      • cryptographic coprocessors (for symmetric and asymmetric cryptography) protected
                        against DPA and Differential Fault Analysis (DFA),
                      • enhanced security sensors for clock frequency range, low and high temperature
                        sensor, supply voltage sensors Single Fault Injection (SFI) attack detection, light
                        sensors, and
                      • encryption of data stored in persistent and transient memory.

                 8.4 Protection against Bypass of Security Related Actions
                      The TOE prevents bypassing security related actions by several software counter
                      measures. Different mechanism are used depending on the software environment.
                      Generally all input parameter are validated and in case of incorrect parameters the
                      program flow is interrupted. Such event is indicated by an appropriate Status Word or
                      Exception. This prevents the TOE from being attacked by undefined or unauthorized
                      commands or data.
                      Basic protection is contributed by implementation of following standards within the TOE:
                      • Java Applets are separated from each other as defined in the Java Card specifications
                        [14], [16], [15]. The separation is achieved by implementation of the firewall which
                        prevents Applets to access data belonging to a different Java Card context. Information
                        sharing between different contexts is possible by supervision of the well defined Java
                        Card Firewall mechanism implemented in the TOE.
                      • Access to security relevant Applications in the TOE (like Security Domains) is protected
                        by the Secure Channel mechanism defined by GlobalPlatform [17]. The secure channel
                        allows access to Applications only if the secret keys are known. Further protection

                       implemented in the TOE prevent brute force attacks on the secret keys of the Secure
                       Channel.
                      The following mechanisms ensure that it is not possible to access information from the
                      Java Layer without being authorized to do so.
                      • Status informations like Life Cycle of Applets or the Authentication State of a
                        Secure Channel are stored in complex patterned values which protects them from
                        manipulation.
                      • Correct order of Java Card Byte Code execution is ensured by the Virtual Machine
                        which detects if Byte Code of a wrong context is executed.
                      • Correct processing of Byte Codes is ensured by checking at the beginning and end of
                        Byte Code execution that the same Byte Code is executed.
                      Execution of native code in the TOE is protected by following mechanisms:
                      • Critical execution paths of the TOE functionality are protected by program flow and call
                        tree protection. This ensures that it is not possible to bypass security relevant checks
                        and verifications.
                      • Critical conditions are evaluated twice. This ensures that physical attacks on the
                        compared values are detected during security relevant checks and verifications.
                      • The true case in if-conditions leads to the less critical program flow or to an error
                        case. This prevents attacks on the program flow during security relevant checks and
                        verifications.
                      • At the exit of critical loops it is checked that the whole loop was processed. This
                        prevents from manipulation of the program flow and jumping out of the loop.
                      • Critical parameters are checked for consistency. This prevents from attacks with

9       Glossary
                      AID Application Identifier, an ISO-7816 data format used for unique identification of Java
                      Card applications (and certain kinds of files in card file systems). The Java Card platform
                      uses the AID data format to identify applets and packages. AIDs are administered by the
                      International Standards Organization (ISO), so they can be used as unique identifiers.
                      AIDs are also used in the security policies (see ’Context’ below): applets’ AIDs are
                      related to the selection mechanisms, packages’ AIDs are used in the enforcement of the
                      firewall. Note: although they serve different purposes, they share the same name space.
                      APDU buffer The APDU buffer is the buffer where the messages sent (received) by
                      the card depart from (arrive to). The JCRE owns an APDU object (which is a JCRE
                      Entry Point and an instance of the javacard.framework.APDU class) that encapsulates
                      APDU messages in an internal byte array, called the APDU buffer. This object is made
                      accessible to the currently selected applet when needed, but any permanent access (out-
                      of selection-scope) is strictly prohibited for security reasons.
                      applet The name is given to a Java Card technology-based user application. An applet
                      is the basic piece of code that can be selected for execution from outside the card. Each
                      applet on the card is uniquely identified by its AID.
                      applet deletion manager The on-card component that embodies the mechanisms
                      necessary to delete an applet or library and its associated data on smart cards using
                      Java Card technology.
                      context A context is an object-space partition associated to a package. Applets within
                      the same Java technology-based package belong to the same context. The firewall is the
                      boundary between contexts (see "current context").
                      current context The JCRE keeps track of the current Java Card System context (also
                      called "the active context"). When a virtual method is invoked on an object, and a context
                      switch is required and permitted, the current context is changed to correspond to the
                      context of the applet that owns the object. When that method returns, the previous
                      context is restored. Invocations of static methods have no effect on the current context.
                      The current context and sharing status of an object together determine if access to an
                      object is permissible.
                      currently selected applet The applet has been selected for execution in the current
                      session. The Java Card RE keeps track of the currently selected Java Card applet.
                      Upon receiving a SELECT command from the CAD or PCD with this applet’s AID, the
                      Java Card RE makes this applet the currently selected applet over the I/O interface that
                      received the command. The Java Card RE sends all further APDU commands received
                      over each interface to the currently selected applet on this interface ([16], Glossary).
                      default applet The applet that is selected after a card reset ([16], §4.1).
                      installer The installer is the on-card application responsible for the installation of applets
                      on the card. It may perform (or delegate) mandatory security checks according to the
                      card issuer policy (for bytecode-verification, for instance), loads and link packages (CAP
                      file(s)) on the card to a suitable form for the Java Card VM to execute the code they
                      contain. It is a subsystem of what is usually called “card manager”; as such, it can be
                      seen as the portion of the card manager that belongs to the TOE.
                      The installer has an AID that uniquely identifies him, and may be implemented as a Java
                      Card applet. However, it is granted specific privileges on an implementation-specific
                      manner ([16], §10).

                      interface A special kind of Java programming language class, which declares methods,
                      but provides no implementation for them. A class may be declared as being the
                      implementation of an interface, and in this case must contain an implementation for each
                      of the methods declared by the interface (See also shareable interface).
                      Java Card RE The runtime environment under which Java programs in a smart card
                      are executed. It is in charge of all the management features such as applet lifetime,
                      applet isolation, object sharing, applet loading, applet initializing, transient objects, the
                      transaction mechanism and so on.
                      Java Card RE Entry Point An object owned by the Java Card RE context but accessible
                      by any application. These methods are the gateways through which applets request
                      privileged Java Card RE services: the instance methods associated to those objects may
                      be invoked from any context, and when that occurs, a context switch to the Java Card RE
                      context is performed.
                      There are two categories of Java Card RE Entry Point Objects: Temporary ones and
                      Permanent ones. As part of the firewall functionality, the Java Card RE detects and
                      restricts attempts to store references to these objects.
                      Java Card RMI Java Card Remote Method Invocation is the Java Card System version
                      2.2 and 3 Classic Edition mechanism enabling a client application running on the CAD
                      platform to invoke a method on a remote object on the card. Notice that in Java Card
                      System, version 2.1.1, the only method that may be invoked from the CAD is the process
                      method of the applet class and that in Java Card System, version 3 Classic Edition, this
                      functionality is optional.
                      Java Card System Java Card System includes the Java Card RE, the Java Card VM,
                      the Java Card API and the installer.
                      Java Card VM The embedded interpreter of bytecodes. The Java Card VM is the
                      component that enforces separation between applications (firewall) and enables secure
                      data sharing.
                      logical channel A logical link to an application on the card. A new feature of the
                      Java Card System, version 2.2 and 3 Classic Edition, that enables the opening of
                      simultaneous sessions with the card, one per logical channel. Commands issued to a
                      specific logical channel are forwarded to the active applet on that logical channel. Java
                      Card platform, version 2.2.2 and 3 Classic Edition, enables opening up to twenty logical
                      channels over each I/O interface (contacted or contactless).
                      NVRAM Non-Volatile Random Access Memory, a type of memory that retains its
                      contents when power is turned off.
                      object deletion The Java Card System version 2.2 and 3 Classic Edition mechanism
                      ensures that any unreferenced persistent (transient) object owned by the current context
                      is deleted. The associated memory space is recovered for reuse prior to the next card
                      reset.
                      PCD Proximity Coupling Device. The PCD is a contactless card reader device.
                      PICC Proximity Card. The PICC is a card with contactless capabilities.
                      Secure Box The Secure Box is a construct which allows to run non certified third party
                      native code and ensures that this code cannot harm, influence or manipulate the JCOP
                      operating system or any of the applets executed by the operating system.
                      Secure Box Native Library The Secure Box Native Library is non certified third party
                      native code running in the Secure Box.

                      shareable interface An interface declaring a collection of methods that an applet
                      accepts to share with other applets. These interface methods can be invoked from an
                      applet in a context different from the context of the object implementing the methods,
                      thus “traversing” the firewall.
                      SIO An object of a class implementing a shareable interface.
                      subject An active entity within the TOE that causes information to flow among objects or
                      change the system’s status. It usually acts on the behalf of a user. Objects can be active
                      and thus are also subjects of the TOE.
                      transient object An object whose contents are not preserved across CAD sessions.
                      The contents of these objects are cleared at the end of the current CAD session or when
                      a card reset is performed. Writes to the fields of a transient object are not affected by
                      transactions.
                      user Any application interpretable by the Java Card RE. That also covers the
                      packages. The associated subject(s), if applicable, is (are) an object(s) belonging to the
                      javacard.framework.applet class.
