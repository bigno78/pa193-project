A.      Certification

1.      Preliminary Remarks
Under the BSIG1 Act, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) has the task of
issuing certificates for information technology products.
Certification of a product is carried out on the instigation of the vendor or a distributor,
hereinafter called the sponsor.
A part of the procedure is the technical examination (evaluation) of the product according
to the security criteria published by the BSI or generally recognised security criteria.
The evaluation is normally carried out by an evaluation facility recognised by the BSI or by
BSI itself.
The result of the certification procedure is the present Certification Report. This report
contains among others the certificate (summarised assessment) and the detailed
Certification Results.
The Certification Results contain the technical description of the security functionality of
the certified product, the details of the evaluation (strength and weaknesses) and
instructions for the user.

2.      Specifications of the Certification Procedure
The certification body conducts the procedure according to the criteria laid down in the
following:
●   Act on the Federal Office for Information Security 1
●   BSI Certification and Approval Ordinance2
●   BSI Schedule of Costs 3
●   Special decrees issued by the Bundesministerium des Innern (Federal Ministry of the
    Interior)
●   DIN EN ISO/IEC 17065 standard
●   BSI certification: Scheme documentation describing the certification process (CC-

3.      Recognition Agreements
In order to avoid multiple certification of the same product in different countries a mutual
recognition of IT security certificates - as far as such certificates are based on ITSEC or
CC - under certain conditions was agreed.

3.1.    European Recognition of CC – Certificates (SOGIS-MRA)
The SOGIS-Mutual Recognition Agreement (SOGIS-MRA) Version 3 became effective in
April 2010. It defines the recognition of certificates for IT-Products at a basic recognition
level and, in addition, at higher recognition levels for IT-Products related to certain SOGIS
Technical Domains only.
The basic recognition level includes Common Criteria (CC) Evaluation Assurance Levels
EAL 1 to EAL 4. For "Smartcards and similar devices" a SOGIS Technical Domain is in
place. For "HW Devices with Security Boxes" a SOGIS Technical Domains is in place, too.
In addition, certificates issued for Protection Profiles based on Common Criteria are part of
the recognition agreement.
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes, details on
recognition, and the history of the agreement can be seen on the website at
https://www.sogis.eu.
The SOGIS-MRA logo printed on the certificate indicates that it is recognised under the
terms of this agreement by the related bodies of the signatory nations. A disclaimer
beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of recognition.
This certificate is recognized under SOGIS-MRA for all assurance components selected.

3.2.    International Recognition of CC – Certificates (CCRA)
The international arrangement on the mutual recognition of certificates based on the CC
(Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement, CCRA-2014) has been ratified on 08
September 2014. It covers CC certificates based on collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP)
(exact use), CC certificates based on assurance components up to and including EAL 2 or
the assurance family Flaw Remediation (ALC_FLR) and CC certificates for Protection
Profiles and for collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP).
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes can be seen on
the website: https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org.
The Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement logo printed on the certificate indicates
that this certification is recognised under the terms of this agreement by the related bodies
of the signatory nations. A disclaimer beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of
recognition.
This certificate is recognized according to the rules of CCRA-2014, i. e. up to and including
CC part 3 EAL 2+ ALC_FLR components.

4.      Performance of Evaluation and Certification
The certification body monitors each individual evaluation to ensure a uniform procedure, a
uniform interpretation of the criteria and uniform ratings.
The product IDEMIA_HC_Germany_NEO_G2.1_COS, V1 has undergone the certification
procedure at BSI.
The evaluation of the product IDEMIA_HC_Germany_NEO_G2.1_COS, V1 was
conducted by SRC Security Research & Consulting GmbH. The evaluation was completed
on 17 July 2020. SRC Security Research & Consulting GmbH is an evaluation facility
(ITSEF)5 recognised by the certification body of BSI.
For this certification procedure the sponsor and applicant is: IDEMIA Germany GmbH.
The product was developed by: IDEMIA Germany GmbHIDEMIA Germany GmbH.
The certification is concluded with the comparability check and the production of this
Certification Report. This work was completed by the BSI.

5.      Validity of the Certification Result
This Certification Report applies only to the version of the product as indicated. The
confirmed assurance package is valid on the condition that
●   all stipulations regarding generation, configuration and operation, as given in the
    following report, are observed,
●   the product is operated in the environment described, as specified in the following report
    and in the Security Target.
For the meaning of the assurance components and assurance levels please refer to CC
itself. Detailed references are listed in part C of this report.
The Certificate issued confirms the assurance of the product claimed in the Security Target
at the date of certification. As attack methods evolve over time, the resistance of the
certified version of the product against new attack methods needs to be re-assessed.
Therefore, the sponsor should apply for the certified product being monitored within the
assurance continuity program of the BSI Certification Scheme (e.g. by a re-assessment or
re-certification). Specifically, if results of the certification are used in subsequent evaluation
and certification procedures, in a system integration process or if a user's risk
management needs regularly updated results, it is recommended to perform a re-
assessment on a regular e.g. annual basis.
In order to avoid an indefinite usage of the certificate when evolved attack methods would
require a re-assessment of the products resistance to state of the art attack methods, the
maximum validity of the certificate has been limited. The certificate issued on 30 July 2020
is valid until 29 July 2025. Validity can be re-newed by re-certification.
The owner of the certificate is obliged:
     1. when advertising the certificate or the fact of the product's certification, to refer to
        the Certification Report as well as to provide the Certification Report, the Security
        Target and user guidance documentation mentioned herein to any customer of the
        product for the application and usage of the certified product,

     2. to inform the Certification Body at BSI immediately about vulnerabilities of the
        product that have been identified by the developer or any third party after issuance
        of the certificate,
     3. to inform the Certification Body at BSI immediately in the case that security relevant
        changes in the evaluated life cycle, e.g. related to development and production sites
        or processes, occur, or the confidentiality of documentation and information related
        to the Target of Evaluation (TOE) or resulting from the evaluation and certification
        procedure where the certification of the product has assumed this confidentiality
        being maintained, is not given any longer. In particular, prior to the dissemination of
        confidential documentation and information related to the TOE or resulting from the
        evaluation and certification procedure that do not belong to the deliverables
        according to the Certification Report part B, or for those where no dissemination
        rules have been agreed on, to third parties, the Certification Body at BSI has to be
        informed.
In case of changes to the certified version of the product, the validity can be extended to
the new versions and releases, provided the sponsor applies for assurance continuity (i.e.
re-certification or maintenance) of the modified product, in accordance with the procedural
requirements, and the evaluation does not reveal any security deficiencies.

1.       Executive Summary
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is the product IDEMIA_HC_Germany_NEO_G2.1_COS,
V1 developed by IDEMIA Germany GmbH.
The TOE is a smart card product according to the G2-COS specification [17] from gematik
and is implemented on the hardware platform Infineon Security Controller
IFX_CCI_000005h from Infineon Technologies AG (refer to [14], [15]).
The TOE is intended to be used as a card operating system platform for cards of the card
generation G2 in the framework of the German health care system.
For this purpose, the TOE serves as secure data storage and secure cryptographic service
provider for card applications running on the TOE and supports them for their specific
security needs related to storage and cryptographic functionalities. In particular, these
storage and cryptographic services are oriented on the different card types eHC (electronic
Health Card), HPC (Health Professional Card) and SMC-B (Security Module Card Type B)
as currently specified for card products of the generation G2 within the German health
care system. These TOE's storage and cryptographic services that are provided by the
TOE and invoked by the human users and components of the German health care system
cover the following issues:
     •   authentication of human users and external devices,
     •   storage of and access control on user data,
     •   key management and cryptographic functions,
     •   management of TSF data including life cycle support,
     •   export of non-sensitive TSF and user data of the object system if implemented.
The TOE comprises of
     •   the circuitry of the dual-interface chip (i.e. contact-based and contactless chip)
         including all IC Dedicated Software being active in the Smart Card Initialisation
         Phase, Personalisation Phase and Usage Phase of the TOE (the integrated circuit,
         IC Infineon IFX_CCI_000005h),
     •   the Smart Card Embedded Software (IDEMIA_HC_Germany_NEO_G2.1_COS, V1
         Operating System),
     •   the so-called Wrapper (TOE specific SW tool for re-coding and interpretation of
         exported TSF and user data), and
     •   the associated guidance documentation.
The TOE is ready for the installation and personalisation of object systems (applications)
on the TOE that match the G2-COS specification [17], but does not contain itself any
object systems (applications).
In functional view, the TOE with its Smart Card Embedded Software
(IDEMIA_HC_Germany_NEO_G2.1_COS, V1 Operating System) is implemented
according to the G2-COS specification [17] from gematik. Hereby, the TOE implements the
mandatory part of the G2-COS specification [17] with the base functionality of the
operating system platform. Concerning [17], the TOE implements in addition the options
Contactless (“Option_kontaktlose_Schnittstelle”), Logical Channel (“Option_logische_-
Kanäle“) and RSA Key Generation (“Option_RSA_KeyGeneration”) as defined in the G2-



                                                                                           11 / 46
Certification Report                                                              BSI-DSZ-CC-1098-2020




COS specification [17]. None of the further options Crypto Box (“Option_Kryptobox”),
PACE for Proximity Coupling Device (“Option_PACE_PCD”), USB (“Option_USB_-
Schnittstelle”) and RSA CVC (“Option_RSA_CVC”) specified in the G2-COS specification
[17] is implemented in the TOE.
Furthermore, the TOE implements some optional commands from the G2-COS
specification [17] and some additional commands and command variants beyond the G2-
COS specification [17] for the usage phase. Refer to the user guidance [12], chapter 3.2
and 7.
For support of the TOE’s OS Personalisation consisting of the Product PrePersonalisation
(loading of an object system) and Product Personalisation (personalisation of a loaded
object system) in the TOE’s life-cycle model (refer to chapter 2), the TOE provides
developer-specific (pre-)personalisation commands. Refer to the user guidance [11],
chapter 8.6.
The TOE's Wrapper is implemented according to the Wrapper specification [18] from
gematik.
The Security Target [6] is the basis for this certification. It is based on the certified
Protection Profile Card Operating System Generation 2 (PP COS G2), Version 2.1, 10 July
2019, BSI-CC-PP-0082-V4-2019 [8]. The Security Target [6] and [7] uses the mandatory
parts of the PP and the optional packages Contactless, Logical Channel and RSA Key
Generation defined in the PP. None of the PP’s further optional packages Crypto Box,
PACE for Proximity Coupling Device and RSA CVC is used.
The TOE Security Assurance Requirements (SAR) are based entirely on the assurance
components defined in Part 3 of the Common Criteria (see part C or [1], Part 3 for details).
The TOE meets the assurance requirements of the Evaluation Assurance Level EAL 4
augmented by ALC_DVS.2, ATE_DPT.2, AVA_VAN.5.
The TOE Security Functional Requirements (SFR) relevant for the TOE are outlined in the
Security Target [6] and [7], chapter 6.1, 7.4, 8.4 and 9.4. They are selected from Common
Criteria Part 2 and some of them are newly defined. Thus the TOE is CC Part 2 extended.
The TOE Security Functional Requirements are implemented by the following TOE
Security Functionality:

 TOE Security Functionality     Addressed issue
 User Authentication            The authentication of users is supported by the following security
                                services:
                                The product implements a classical PIN-based user authentication. It
                                is possible to flexibly instantiate the service, e.g. by a minimum

                                The system allows for unblocking of a blocked PIN using a PIN
                                unblocking code and to user roles which have the right to unblock the
                                PIN.
                                For convenience purposes, the product implements multi-reference
                                PINs which share the same personal identification number and other
                                attributes. This way it is possible that a user keeps several different
                                PINs in synchronisation with each other.
                                A role with the required rights is allowed to activate or deactivate the
                                verification requirement. This is also a convenience function which
                                leverages the requirement to enter PINs.

Internal and External Device      The product is capable to authenticate an external role. After a
Authentication                    successful role authentication, the product grants additional access
                                  and usage rights to the external entity.
                                  The product also implements internal authentication services, which
                                  proof the authenticity of the card to an external entity. These services
                                  can either be used as one step of a mutual authentication protocol or
                                  to use the product as an authentication token in a larger eco-system.
                                  Mutual Authentication protocols with the establishment of secure
                                  sessions between the card and a trusted external entity are also a
                                  major security service provided by the product. Via the secured
                                  channels it is possible to import and export data protecting the data
                                  integrity and confidentiality.
Security State Model              The product effectively models, stores and manages the security
                                  states acquired by external entities via user or device authentication.
                                  The proper modelling of security states is a prerequisite for
                                  controlling the access to the object system and the usage of
                                  cryptographic services.
Cryptographic Services            The product implements several cryptographic services.
                                  The card is capable to verify and import digital certificates. This way it
                                  is possible to load key material of a public key infrastructure onto the
                                  card for further processing.
                                  The generation and verification of digital signatures are additional
                                  security services which enable the card holder to effectively sign
                                  electronic data and verify such signed data.
                                  Various enciphering, deciphering, and transciphering services
                                  support cryptographic use cases in collaboration with the background
                                  system and other cards.
                                  As an additional service, the product implements the generation of a
                                  fingerprint over the effective code-base which allows for precisely
                                  identifying a specific product release.
Secure Access-Controlled Object   The object system that acts as storage for PINs, cryptographic keys,
System                            and user data provides strict access control mechanisms.
                                  It is possible to model access rules in a fine-grained manner based
                                  on the effective command currently executed, the life-cycle state of
                                  the affected object and the product, the security environment the
                                  product operates in and the current IO state, i.e. the IO interface
                                  used or the status of a secure session.
                                  It is also possible to extend the object system by the loading of new
                                  application dedicated files containing additional data and key material
                                  in the field. This feature is also subject to the access control enforced
                                  by the object system.
                                  The object system provides additional means to initialize users which
                                  allow for initializing the content of the object system. This feature is
                                  used in the approval process of object systems to ensure that a
                                  specific instantiation of an object system adheres to a given
                                  specification.

 Elementary Cryptographic         The elementary cryptographic functions of the product form the basis
 Functions                        for the different authentication protocols and cryptographic services.
                                  The product supports the AES symmetric ciphers with up to 256 bits
                                  as well as additional modes of operation like cipher-block-chaining, or
                                  CMAC computations.
                                  Both the RSA and ECC crypto operations support asymmetric crypto
                                  services and authentication protocols. Additionally, the product
                                  supports on-card key generation.
                                  Several hash-functions like SHA1 and SHA2 support cryptographic
                                  operations like the generation of digital signatures or the derivation of
                                  session keys for secure initialization.
                                  A high-quality random number generator is used internally e.g. for the
                                  generation of cryptographic key material of high quality and also
                                  supports the implementation of many cryptographic protocols.
                                  For the implementation of the elementary cryptographic functions the
                                  embedded software uses the cryptographic features of the underlying
                                  high-secure IC and its dedicated crypto library.
 High Attack Resistance           The product is a secure element which exhibits a high attack
                                  resistance even if an attacker has physical access to the product.
                                  This attack resistance is achieved by strong self-protection
                                  mechanisms and a security design which prevents the bypassing of
                                  security features. Furthermore, the start-up phase (after Reset or
                                  Power On) of the product is secured to ensure that the product
                                  properly initializes from a down-state to a secure mode of operation.
                                  The domain separation is secured by memory access control based
                                  on different privilege levels.
                                  The security features implemented by the product closely collaborate
                                  with the protection mechanisms of the underlying security IC.

The commercial numbering of the TOE IDEMIA_HC_Germany_NEO_G2.1_COS, V1 by
Infineon Technologies AG is as follows:

        H13 chip family

        Product Type: SLC32GDA

By executing the GET DATA command (refer to the user guidance documentation [11],
[12]), the following product identification data of the foundry are set:

        IC Manufacturer: 81 00

        IC Type: 13 2A

        OS Version: 02 02

        Mask Date: 00 62

        OS Subversion: 04 00

The TOE IDEMIA_HC_Germany_NEO_G2.1_COS, V1 is as well known under the
following product identificator:
        Manufacturer: ‘44 45 49 44 4D' (DEIDM)


                                                                                                       16 / 46

       Product: ‘4D 48 43 47 5F 47 32 32' (MHCG_G22)
       OS Version Number: '02 02 04' (2.2.4)
Hereby, the TOE is related to Release R3.1.1-1 and Product Type Version (PTV) 4.5.0-0
as defined by gematik.

According to the Security Target [6] and [7], chapter 1.3.4.1 the life-cycle model of the TOE
consists of the following phases:
Phase 1:      Smart Card Embedded Software Development
Phase 2:      IC Development
Phase 3:      IC Manufacturing
Phase 4:      IC Packaging (combined with Phase 3 to IC Manufacturing)
Phase 5:      OS Loading
Phase 6:      OS Personalisation, consisting of Product PrePersonalisation and
              Product Personalisation
Phase 7:      Operational Use

For TOE production, two different production variants can be distinguished: In the
Integrated Production Variant loading of the Operating System takes place at the IC
manufacturer whereas in the Deferred Production Variant loading of the Operating System
is carried by IDEMIA Germany GmbH. There is a further intermediate phase called OS
PrePersonalisation between Phase 5 and Phase 6, which is either coupled to Phase 5 (in
the Deferred Production Variant) or coupled to Phase 6 (Integrated Production Variant).
TOE delivery in the sense of the CC takes place at the end of Phase 5, more detailed after
the OS PrePersonalisation in the Deferred Production Variant has been carried out, or
alternatively in the Integrated Production Variant without having the OS PrePersonalisation
performed. In the latter case, the OS PrePersonalisation lies in the hands of the Product
PrePersonaliser.
The TOE or product respectively is delivered as smart card (dual-interface, with or without
activated contactless interface) with already loaded Operating System and, depending on
the production variant (see above), with or without finished OS PrePersonalisation.
The user is provided with guidance for TOE identification in [12], chapter 3.1.2. For TOE
identification the COS version as well as the product variant has to be checked. The
variant can either be a test configuration (Test Card) or an operational configuration (Real
Card). The Test Configuration is not considered as part of the TOE.
For identification of the product during its different life-cycle states the GET DATA
command (CLA=80, INS=CA) can be used.
With the parameters P1=’DF’ and P2=’99’ the Card Configuration Data as described in
[11], chapter 8.6.5, 8.7.6 can be retrieved whereby the COS version can be identified. The
following response is expected:

3.     Security Policy
The TOE is a composite smart card product, based on the hardware platform Infineon
Security Controller IFX_CCI_000005h from Infineon Technologies AG and with Smart Card
Embedded Software IDEMIA_HC_Germany_NEO_G2.1_COS, V1 Operating System
implemented by IDEMIA Germany GmbH according to the G2-COS specification [17] from
gematik.
The Security Policy is expressed by the set of Security Functional Requirements and
implemented by the TOE. It covers the following issues:
The TOE is intended to be used as a card operating system platform for applications of the
card generation G2 in the framework of the German health care system. For this purpose,
the TOE serves as secure data storage and secure cryptographic service provider for card
applications running on the TOE and supports them for their specific security needs related
to storage and cryptographic functionalities. In particular, these storage and cryptographic
services are oriented on the card types eHC (electronic Health Card), HPC (Health
Professional Card) and SMC-B (Security Module Card Type B) as currently specified for
card products of the generation G2 within the German health care system.
The TOE implements physical and logical security functionality in order to protect user
data and TSF data stored and operated on the smart card when used in a hostile
environment. Hence, the TOE maintains integrity and confidentiality of code and data
stored in its memories and the different CPU modes with the related capabilities for
configuration and memory access and for integrity, the correct operation and the
confidentiality of security functionality provided by the TOE. Therefore the TOE's overall
policy is to protect against malfunction, leakage, physical manipulation and probing.
Besides, the TOE's life-cycle is supported as well as the user Identification whereas the
abuse of functionality is prevented. Furthermore, specific cryptographic services including
random number generation and key management functionality are being provided to be
securely used by the smart card embedded software.
Specific details concerning the above mentioned security policies can be found in the
Security Target [6] and [7], chapter 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.

4.     Assumptions and Clarification of Scope
The Assumptions defined in the Security Target and some aspects of Threats and
Organisational Security Policies are not covered by the TOE itself. These aspects lead to
specific security objectives to be fulfilled by the TOE-Environment. The following topics are
of relevance:

                   Table 8: Security Objectives for the operational environment

Details can be found in the Security Target [6] and [7], chapter 4.2, 7.3 and 8.3.

5.       Architectural Information
The TOE is set up as a composite product. It is composed of the Infineon Security
Controller IFX_CCI_000005h from Infineon Technologies AG and the Smart Card
Embedded Software with the IDEMIA_HC_Germany_NEO_G2.1_COS, V1 Operating
System developed by IDEMIA Germany GmbH.
For the implementation of the cryptographic functionality the Smart Card Embedded
Software uses the cryptographic features of the underlying high-secure IC and (partially)
its dedicated cryptographic library.
For details concerning the CC evaluation of the underlying IC see the evaluation
documentation under the Certification ID BSI-DSZ-CC-1110-V3-2020 ([14], [15]).
According to the TOE design the Security Functions of the TOE as listed in chapter 1 are
implemented by the following subsystems:
     •   Application Layer (APP)
     •   Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
     •   System Layer (SYS)



                                                                                                  20 / 46

     •   Shared System/Standard Services (SSS)
     •   Wrapper

6.       Documentation
The evaluated documentation as outlined in Table 2 is being provided with the product to
the customer. This documentation contains the required information for secure usage of
the TOE in accordance with the Security Target [6] and [7].
Additional obligations and notes for secure usage of the TOE as outlined in chapter 10 of
this report have to be followed.

7.       IT Product Testing
The developer tested all TOE Security Functions either on real cards or with simulator
tests. For all commands and functionality tests, test cases are specified in order to
demonstrate its expected behaviour including error cases. Hereby a representative sample
including all boundary values of the parameter set, e.g. all command APDUs with valid and
invalid inputs are tested and all functions are tested with valid and invalid inputs.
Repetition of developer tests was performed during the independent evaluator tests.
Since many Security Functions can be tested by APDU command sequences, the
evaluators performed these tests with real cards. This is considered to be a reasonable
approach because the developer tests include a full coverage of all security functionality.
Furthermore, penetration tests were chosen by the evaluators for those Security Functions
where internal secrets of the card could maybe be modified or observed during testing.
During their independent testing, the evaluators covered:
     •   testing APDU commands related to authentication
     •   testing APDU commands related to access control,
     •   testing APDU commands related to general protection of User data and TSF data
     •   testing APDU commands related to cryptographic functions,
     •   testing APDU commands related to key management,
     •   testing APDU commands related to protection of communication,
     •   testing APDU commands related to security relevant attributes,
     •   testing the LOAD APPLICATION commands,
     •   penetration testing related to the verification of the reliability of the TOE,
     •   source code analysis performed by the evaluators,
     •   side channel analysis for hash,
     •   fault injection attacks (laser attacks),
     •   testing APDU commands for the object system installation, personalisation and
         usage phase,
     •   testing APDU commands for the commands using cryptographic mechanisms,
     •   fuzzy testing on APDU processing.




                                                                                               21 / 46

The evaluators have tested the TOE systematically against high attack potential during
their penetration testing.
The achieved test results correspond to the expected test results.

8.      Evaluated Configuration
This certification covers the following configuration of the TOE as outlined in the Security
Target [6] and [7]:
                       IDEMIA_HC_Germany_NEO_G2.1_COS, V1
There is only one configuration of the TOE. Refer to the information provided in chapter 2
of this Certification Report.
The TOE is installed on a dual-interface chip (contact-based and contactless chip) of type
Infineon Security Controller IFX_CCI_000005h from Infineon Technologies AG. This IC is
certified under the Certification ID BSI-DSZ-CC-1110-V3-2020 (refer to [15]).
For the implementation of the cryptographic functionality the Smart Card Embedded
Software uses the cryptographic features of the underlying high-secure IC and (partially)
its dedicated cryptographic library.
The TOE covering the IC and the Smart Card Embedded Software
(IDEMIA_HC_Germany_NEO_G2.1_COS, V1 Operating System) is delivered as a smart
card (dual-interface with or without activated contactless interface) without any object
system installed. The configuration as Test Card is explicitly not in scope of this evaluation
as it is not considered as part of the TOE. For details refer to chapter 2 of this Certification
Report.
The user can identify the certified TOE by the TOE response to specific APDU commands,
more detailed by using the command GET DATA in different command variants according
to the user guidance documentation [11], chapter 8.6.5, 8.7.2 and 8.7.6, and [12], chapter
3.2.4, 7.7.7 and 777.1.2. See chapter 2 of this Certification Report for details.

The Evaluation Methodology CEM [2] was used for those components up to EAL 5
extended by advice of the Certification Body for components beyond EAL 5 and guidance
specific for the technology of the product [4] (AIS 34).
The following guidance specific for the technology was used:
(i)     Composite product evaluation for Smart Cards and similar devices according to AIS
        36 (see [4]). On base of this concept the relevant guidance documents of the
        underlying IC platform (refer to the guidance documents covered by [15]) and the
        document ETR for composite evaluation from the IC’s evaluation ([16]) have been
        applied in the TOE evaluation. Related to AIS 36 the updated version of the JIL
        document ‘Composite product evaluation for Smart Cards and similar devices’,
        version 1.5.1, May 2018 was taken into account.



                                                                                          22 / 46

(iv)     Application of Attack Potential to Smartcards (AIS 26, see [4]).
(v)      Application of CC to Integrated Circuits (AIS 25, see [4]).
(vi)     Security Architecture requirements (ADV_ARC) for smart cards and similar devices
         (AIS 25, see [4]).
(vii)    Evaluation Methodology for CC Assurance Classes for EAL5+ and EAL6 (AIS 34,
         see [4])
(viii)   Functionality classes and evaluation methodology of physical and deterministic
         random number generators (AIS 20 and AIS 31, see [4]).
(ix)     Informationen zur Evaluierung von kryptographischen Algorithmen (AIS 46, see [4]).
For smart card specific methodology the scheme interpretations AIS 25, AIS 26, AIS 34,
AIS 36, AIS 37 and AIS 46 (see [4]) were used. For RNG assessment the scheme
interpretations AIS 20 and AIS 31 were used (see [4]).
A document ETR for composite evaluation according to AIS 36 has not been provided in
the course of this certification procedure. It could be provided by the ITSEF and submitted
to the certification body for approval subsequently.
The assurance refinements outlined in the Security Target were followed in the course of
the evaluation of the TOE.
As a result of the evaluation the verdict PASS is confirmed for the following assurance
components:
●   All components of the EAL 4 package including the class ASE as defined in the CC (see
    also part C of this report).
●   The components ALC_DVS.2, ATE_DPT.2, AVA_VAN.5 augmented for this TOE
    evaluation.
The evaluation has confirmed:
●   PP Conformance:          Card Operating System Generation 2 (PP COS G2), Version
                             2.1, 10 July 2019, BSI-CC-PP-0082-V4-2019 [8]
●   for the Functionality:   PP conformant
                             Common Criteria Part 2 extended
●   for the Assurance:       Common Criteria Part 3 conformant
                             EAL 4 augmented by ALC_DVS.2, ATE_DPT.2, AVA_VAN.5
The Security Target [6] and [7] uses the mandatory parts of the PP and the optional
packages Contactless, Logical Channel and RSA Key Generation defined in the PP. None
of the PP’s further optional packages Crypto Box, PACE for Proximity Coupling Device and
RSA CVC is used.
For specific evaluation results regarding the development and production environment see
annex B in part D of this report.
The results of the evaluation are only applicable to the TOE as defined in chapter 2 and
the configuration as outlined in chapter 8 above.

9.2.    Results of cryptographic assessment
The table in annex C of part D of this report gives an overview of the cryptographic
functionalities inside the TOE to enforce the security policy and outlines the standard of
application where its specific appropriateness is stated.
The strength of these cryptographic algorithms was not rated in the course of this
certification procedure (see BSIG Section 9, Para. 4, Clause 2).
According to the specification [17] and the Technical Guideline BSI TR-03116-1 [21] the
algorithms are suitable for authentication and key agreement and for supporting integrity,
authenticity and confidentiality of the data stored in and processed by the TOE as a card
operating system platform that is intended to be used for cards of the card generation G2
in the framework of the German health care system. The validity period of each algorithm
is mentioned in the official catalogue [21].
The cryptographic algorithms and protocols as outlined in Table 9 in annex C of part D of
this report are implemented in the card operating system and hereby make use of the
IFX_CCI_000005h secure dual-interface controller and its related Crypto Libraries ACL
v2.08.007 and SCL v02.04.002 provided by Infineon Technologies AG that are part of the
TOE. In particular, the core routines for RSA (encryption, decryption, signature generation,
signature verification and key generation) and ECC (ECDSA signature generation and
verification, ECDH, key generation), the AES CBC mode and the SHA hash calculation are
taken from the Crypto Libraries, for random number generation the TOE uses the PTG.3
provided by the IC. The security evaluation of these cryptographic algorithms was
performed in the framework of the certification of the IC with its related Crypto Libraries
(refer to the Certification Report [15] and the corresponding Security Target [14]). The TOE
relies on the correct (i.e. standard-conform) and secure implementation of these
cryptographic algorithms. The remaining cryptographic implementation was analysed in
the framework of the present composite evaluation of the TOE.

10. Obligations and Notes for the Usage of the TOE
The documents as outlined in Table 2 contain necessary information about the usage of
the TOE and all security hints therein have to be considered. In addition all aspects of
Assumptions, Threats and OSPs as outlined in the Security Target not covered by the TOE
itself need to be fulfilled by the operational environment of the TOE.
The customer or user of the product shall consider the results of the certification within his
system risk management process. In order for the evolution of attack methods and
techniques to be covered, he should define the period of time until a re-assessment of the
TOE is required and thus requested from the sponsor of the certificate.
The limited validity for the usage of cryptographic algorithms as outlined in chapter 9 has
to be considered by the user and his system risk management process, too.
Some security measures are partly implemented in this certified TOE, but require
additional configuration or control or measures to be implemented by a product layer on
top, e.g. the Application Software using the TOE. For this reason the TOE includes
guidance documentation (see Table 2) which contains obligations and guidelines for the
developer of the product layer on top on how to securely use this certified TOE and which
measures have to be implemented in order to fulfil the security requirements of the
Security Target of the TOE. In the course of the evaluation of the composite product or




                                                                                        24 / 46
BSI-DSZ-CC-1098-2020                                                          Certification Report




system it must be examined if the required measures have been correctly and effectively
implemented by the product layer on top.
In particular, the following aspects from the TOE user guidance documentation [11] to [13]
need to be taken into account when using the TOE and when designing and implementing
object systems (applications) intended to be set up on the TOE, especially in view of later
TR-conformity testing of card products according to the Technical Guideline BSI TR-03144
([19]):
 ●   Security requirements and hints for designing and implementing object systems
     (applications) intended to be set up and running on the TOE:
     This concerns the design and implementation of object systems of card products
     including application development prior to and after card product delivery as well as
     card management e.g. by using the command LOAD APPLICATION.
     For an object system, one has to take care of the choice of the access rules, flags and
     other security attributes for the object system and its objects. In particular, this
     concerns key objects, PIN objects and TOE specific system objects including their
     assigned security attributes.
     The specific life cycle state concept of the TOE for objects managed and processed by
     the TOE as the MF, folders, files, key and PIN objects has to be taken into account.
     Especially, the concept of physical and logical life cycle states and their specific
     processing by the TOE are of relevance for object systems intended to run on the TOE
     (refer to [17]).
     Any object system set up on the TOE shall only make use of the TOE's certified
     functionality. Card products with an object system that do not fulfil this requirement run
     out of the scope of the certified TOE and shall not be delivered respective used. It has
     to be considered that the TOE implements the functionality of the G2-COS
     specification [17] that is defined as mandatory as well as the chosen optional
     packages Contactless, Logical Channel and RSA Key Generation in [17], but none of
     the further optional packages Crypto Box, PACE for Proximity Coupling Device and
     RSA CVC (and USB) specified in [17]. Optional commands from the G2-COS
     specification [17] and additional commands and command variants beyond the G2-
     COS specification [17] for the usage phase provided by the TOE are outlined in the
     user guidance [12], chapter 3.2 and 7. Developer-specific (pre-)personalisation
     commands are described in the user guidance [11], chapter 8.6.
     Within an object system no key ID or PIN ID duplicates in the same folder shall exist.
     The object system has to be checked for taking this requirement into account by using
     the TOE's Wrapper according to the user guidance [13], chapter 2.3.6. Card products
     with an object system that do not fulfil the requirement run out of the scope of the
     certified TOE and shall not be delivered respective used.
     Refer to the user guidance documentation [11], [12] and [13], chapter 2.3.
 ●   Key usage and handling:
     Refer to the user guidance [12], chapter 8.4, 13.1 and 13.3.
 ●   PIN / PUK Handling:
     Refer to the user guidance [12], chapter 6, 8.3, 13.2, 13.3.1 and 13.3.2.




                                                                                           25 / 46

 ●   Security requirements and hints for Phase 6 of the TOE's life-cycle model described in
     the ST ([6], [7]), more detailed for the OS Personalisation Phase consisting of the
     Product PrePersonalisation (covering the loading of a pre-configured object system
     onto the card) and the Product Personalisation (covering the personalisation of the
     previously loaded object system with individual data and secrets):
     In particular, the TOE's specific load concept and functionality for loading a pre-
     configured object system onto the card in the Product PrePersonalisation and for the
     personalisation of such installed object system in the Product Personalisation has to
     be taken into account.
     Refer to the user guidance [11].
 ●   Security requirements and hints for Phase 7 of the TOE's life-cycle model described in
     the ST ([6], [7]), more detailed for the operational use of the card:
     Refer to the user guidance documentation [12].
 ●   The TOE's Wrapper and its specifics beyond the Wrapper specification [18]:
     Refer to the user guidance [13].
 ●   Overwriting security attributes of objects in card products:
     For the design and implementation of a card product running on the TOE that
     undergoes a later TR-conformity testing according to the Technical Guideline BSI TR-
     03144 ([19]) it is strongly recommended to care for that via the TOE's specific
     personalisation commands as well as via the TOE's regular commands available in
     Phase 7 of the TOE's life-cycle model initialised security attributes and public key data
     of the object system and its objects cannot be overwritten (except for where explicitly
     intended by the object system's intention and design). This addresses the appropriate
     setting of access rules and flags for the object system's objects.
     Refer to the user guidance documentation [11] and [12].

For a TR-conformity testing of a card product set up on the TOE according to the Technical
Guideline BSI TR-03144 ([19]) the following specific aspects and issues have to be taken
into account:
 ●   For the usage of the TOE's Wrapper in the framework of the TR-conformity testing of a
     card product according to the Technical Guideline BSI TR-03144 ([19]) refer in
     particular to its specifics beyond the Wrapper specification [18] as these are outlined
     in the user guidance [13].
 ●   For the TR-conformity testing of a card product according to the Technical Guideline
     BSI TR-03144 ([19]), the TOE’s Wrapper shall not be used together with the
     configuration file CFG_THROW_WARNING. Refer to the user guidance [13], chapter
     2.4.
 ●   Specific requirements for the TR-conformity testing of a card product according to the
     Technical Guideline BSI TR-03144 ([19]) are specified in the user guidance [13],
     chapter 2.3 including subchapters. Each requirement for a card product addressed
     there has to be fulfilled by the card product undergoing a TR-conformity testing
     according to the Technical Guideline BSI TR-03144 ([19]), and a corresponding check
     for fulfilment of these requirements within the card product has to be performed in the
     framework of the TR-conformity testing.




                                                                                        26 / 46
BSI-DSZ-CC-1098-2020                                                         Certification Report




     Note: If for a card product such check for fulfilment of the requirements addressed in
     [13], chapter 2.3 is not possible or if the card product does not fulfil the requirements
     addressed in [13], chapter 2.3 this card product will be rejected for a TR-certificate
     according to the Technical Guideline BSI TR-03144 ([19]).
 ●   The implementation of the TOE's Wrapper provides the functionality to handle and
     export Key-/PIN-objects (including corresponding public security attributes) with
     duplicated key-/PIN-Identifiers within the same folder of an object system (application)
     that is set up on the TOE.
     Each folder in the card product's object system has to be checked whether key ID or
     PIN ID duplicates within this folder are existing. This check shall be done by using the
     TOE's Wrapper according to the user guidance [13], chapter 2.3.6.
     Note: If there is any folder with key ID or PIN ID duplicates found the card product will
     be rejected for a TR-certificate according to the Technical Guideline BSI TR-03144
     ([19]).
 ●   For the card product, it has to be checked that via the TOE's specific personalisation
     commands as well as via the TOE's regular commands available in Phase 7 of the
     TOE's life-cycle model initialised security attributes and public key data of the object
     system and its objects cannot be overwritten (except for where explicitly intended by
     the object system's intention and design).
     Note: If overwriting of initialised security attributes and public key data of the object
     system and its objects via the TOE's specific personalisation commands or via the
     TOE's regular commands available in Phase 7 of the TOE's life-cycle model is
     possible and not technically suppressed (except for data where overwriting is explicitly
     intended by the object system's intention and design) the card product will be rejected
     for a TR-certificate according to the Technical Guideline BSI TR-03144 ([19]).
 ●   Any object system set up on the TOE shall only make use of the TOE's certified
     functionality. The card product's object system has to be checked for taking this
     requirement into account.
     It has to be considered that the TOE implements the functionality of the G2-COS
     specification [17] that is defined as mandatory as well as the chosen optional
     packages Contactless, Logical Channel and RSA Key Generation in [17], but none of
     the further optional packages Crypto Box, PACE for Proximity Coupling Device and
     RSA CVC (and USB) specified in [17]. Optional commands from the G2-COS
     specification [17] and additional commands and command variants beyond the G2-
     COS specification [17] for the usage phase provided by the TOE are outlined in the
     user guidance [12], chapter 3.2 and 7. Developer-specific (pre-)personalisation
     commands are described in the user guidance [11], chapter 8.6.
     Note: If there is any object found for which the TOE's Wrapper throws an exception or
     where the Wrapper or Konsistenz-Prüftool according to the Technical Guideline BSI
     TR-03143 ([20]) indicates the use of uncertified COS functionality the card product will
     be rejected for a TR-certificate according to the Technical Guideline BSI TR-03144
     ([19]).
 ●   If in the framework of the TR-conformity testing of a card product according to the
     Technical Guideline BSI TR-03144 ([19]) the Konsistenz-Prüftool according to the
     Technical Guideline BSI TR-03143 ([20]) depicts in its test report within an access rule




                                                                                          27 / 46
Certification Report                                                       BSI-DSZ-CC-1098-2020




      of an object a wild card or an APDU header lying outside the G2-COS specification
      [17] or the user guidance [12] this has to be manually examined and valuated.
 ●    For a card product that undergoes a TR-conformity testing according to the Technical
      Guideline BSI TR-03144 ([19]), the identification data of the underlying platform (TOE)
      shall be checked for correctness, that is consistency related to the identification data
      depicted in chapter 2 of this Certification Report.
 ●    For a card product that undergoes a TR-conformity testing according to the Technical
      Guideline BSI TR-03144 ([19]) with using the Konsistenz-Prüftool according to the
      Technical Guideline BSI TR-03143 ([20]) it has to be taken into account that for an
      initialised, not yet personalised card product the functionality of the command READ
      BINARY (in particular for reading out a file as e.g. EF.ATR) is not available.
      In the case that the Konsistenz-Prüftool according to the Technical Guideline BSI TR-
      03143 ([20]) expects for its conformity test run read access to a file (as e.g. the
      EF.ATR) via the command READ BINARY, for conformity testing of the initialised, not
      yet personalised card product an appropriate workaround has to be set up by the TR-
      evaluation body. This workaround has to satisfy the overall intention of the TR-
      conformity testing according to the Technical Guideline BSI TR-03144 ([19]) that in the
      end a complete picture of the object system installed in the initialised, not yet
      personalised card product is obtained and a comparison against the respective object
      system specification is carried out.
