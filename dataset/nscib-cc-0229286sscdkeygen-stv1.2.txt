These configurations are based on one or more predefined applets; different configurations might use the
same underlying applet.
The whole applet code resides in the Flash memory; the applets providing these different configurations
are instantiated into Flash memory. Multiple configurations (and hence support for different applications)
can be present at the same time by instantiating multiple applets with their distinct configurations with
some restrictions detailed below. A common combination could be an ICAO MRTD applet and an SSCD ap-
plet providing a travel application with LDS data and EAC authentication together with a signature applica-
tion.
Via configuration the instanciated applets can be tied to the contactless and/or the contact interface, re-
spectively.

1.4.2 TOE definition
The TOE is a combination of hardware and software configured to securely create, use and manage signa-
ture-creation data (SCD). The TOE consists of
       the circuitry of the chip (the integrated circuit, IC) including the contact-based interface with hard-
        ware for the contactless interface including contacts for the antenna, providing basic cryptographic
        functionalities,

Figure 1: Schematic view on the Target of Evaluation (TOE) and its boundaries. The TOE is based on the
certified hardware and Javacard OS. Besides the NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 - cryptovision ePasslet
Suite code in non-volatile memory and the applet instantiated from it which forms the TOE of this security
target, it may also contain additional applets which are not part of the TOE.


The TOE’s functionality claimed by this security target is realized by the NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71
- cryptovision ePasslet Suite in SSCD with key generation configuration. The SSCD with key generation
configuration provides a PKCS#15 compliant file structure and a separate DF for the SSCD functionality
(D.Sig). While D.Sig provides the TOE’s functionality claimed by this security target, the PKCS#15 part is out
of scope of the certification.

1.4.4 TOE functions
The SSCD protects the SCD during its whole life cycle as to be used in a signature-creation process solely by
its signatory. The TOE provides the following functions:

       to generate signature-creation data (SCD) and the correspondent signature-verification data
        (SVD),
       to export the SVD for certification,
       to, optionally, receive and store certificate info,
       to switch the TOE from a non-operational state to an operational state, and
       if in an operational state, to create electronic signatures for data with the following steps:
        a) select an SCD if multiple are present in the SSCD,
        b) authenticate the signatory and determine its intent to sign,
        c) receive data to be signed or a unique representation thereof (DTBS/R),
        d) apply an appropriate cryptographic signature-creation function using the selected SCD to the
           DTBS/R.

The TOE may implement its function for digital signature creation to conform to the specifications in ETSI
TS 101 733 (CAdES) [CADES], ETSI TS 101 903 (XAdES) [XADES] and ETSI TS 101 903 (PADES) [PADES].
The TOE is prepared for the signatory's use by
       generating at least one SCD/SVD pair, and
       personalising for the signatory by storing in the TOE:
        a) the signatory’s reference authentication data (RAD)
        b) optionally, certificate info for at least one SCD in the TOE.
After preparation the SCD shall be in a non-operational state. Upon receiving a TOE the signatory shall verify
its non-operational state and change the SCD state to operational.

After preparation the intended, legitimate user should be informed of the signatory’s verification authenti-
cation data (VAD) required for use of the TOE in signing. If the VAD is a password or PIN, providing this
information shall protect the confidentiality of the corresponding RAD.

If the use of an SCD is no longer required, then it shall be destroyed (e.g. by erasing it from memory) as well
as the associated certificate info, if any exists.

1.4.5 Operation of the TOE
This paragraph presents a functional overview of the TOE in its distinct operational environments:
       The preparation environment, where it interacts with a certification service provider through a cer-
        tificate-generation application (CGA) to obtain a certificate for the signature validation data (SVD)


                                                     8 of 82
NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 – SSCD with Key Generation Security Target Lite


        corresponding with signature creation data (SCD) the TOE has generated. The initialization environ-
        ment interacts further with the TOE to personalize it with the initial value of the reference-authen-
        tication data (RAD).
       The signing environment where it interacts with a signer through a signature-creation application
        (SCA) to sign data after authenticating the signer as its signatory. The signature-creation application
        provides the data to be signed, or a unique representation thereof (DTBS/R) as input to the TOE
        signature-creation function and obtains the resulting electronic signature.
       The management environments where it interacts with the user or an SSCD-Provisioning service
        provider to perform management operations, e.g. for the signatory to reset a blocked RAD. A single
        device, e.g. a smart card terminal, may provide the required secure environment for management
        and signing.
The signing environment, the management environment and the preparation environment are secure and
protect data exchanged with the TOE.
The TOE stores signature creation data and reference authentication data. The TOE may store multiple in-
stances of SCD. In this case the TOE shall provide a function to identify each SCD and the SCA can provide
an interface to the signer to select an SCD for use in the signature creation function of the SSCD. The TOE
protects the confidentiality of the SCD and restricts its use in signature creation to its signatory. The elec-
tronic signature created with the TOE is a qualified electronic signature as defined in [Directive]2 if the cer-
tificate for the SVD is a qualified certificate ([Directive], Annex I)3. Determining the state of the certificate
as qualified in beyond the scope of this standard.
The signature creation application shall protect the integrity of the input it provides to the TOE signature-
creation function as being consistent with the user data authorized for signing by the signatory. Unless im-
plicitly known to the TOE, the SCA indicates the kind of the signing input (as DTBS/R) it provides and com-
putes any hash values required. The TOE may augment the DTBS/R with signature parameters it stores and
then computes a hash-value over the input as needed by the kind of input and the used cryptographic al-
gorithm.
The TOE stores signatory reference authentication data (RAD) to authenticate a user as its signatory. The
RAD is a password e.g. PIN. The TOE protects the confidentiality and integrity of the RAD. The TOE may
provide a user interface to directly receive verification authentication data (VAD) from the user, alterna-
tively, the TOE receives the VAD from the signature-creation application. If the signature-creation applica-
tion handles, is requesting or obtaining a VAD from the user, it shallis assumed to protect the confidentiality
and integrity of this data.
A certification service provider and a SSCD-provisioning service provider interact with the TOE in the secure
preparation environment to perform any preparation function of the TOE required before control of the
TOE is given to the legitimate user. These functions may include:
       initialising the RAD,
       generating a key pair,
       storing personal information of the legitimate user.
In the case at hand the TOE is a smart card or electronic ID document. In this case a smart-card terminal
may be deployed that provides the required secure environment to handle a request for signatory authori-
zation. A signature can be obtained on a document prepared by a signature-creation application component

2009-MA-02 - references the [Directive], it also incorporates the requirements of the eIDAS regulation [Re-
gulation] and the according commission implementing regulation [Implementing].

running on personal computer connected to the card terminal. The signature creation application, after
presenting the document to the user and after obtaining the authorization PIN initiates the electronic sig-
nature creation function of the smart card through the terminal.
The RAD verification is typically performed by direct PIN verification (VERIFY PIN command); to further pro-
tect the RAD (password or PIN) – especially in a contactless application scenario – the Password Authenti-
cated Connection Establishmanet (PACE) protocol according to [TR03110] can be used.

1.4.6 Major security features of the TOE
The TOE provides the following TOE security functionalities:
         TSF_Access manages the access to objects (files, directories, data and secrets) stored in the applet’s
          file system. It also controls write access of initialization, pre-personalization and personalization
          data4.
         TSF_Admin manages the storage of manufacturing data, pre-personalization data and personaliza-
          tion data.
         TSF_Secret ensures secure management of secrets such as cryptographic keys. This covers secure
          key storage, access to keys as well as secure key deletion. These mechanisms are mainly provided
          by TSF_OS.
         TSF_Crypto performs high level cryptographic operations. The implementation is mainly based on
          the Security Functionalities provided by TSF_OS.
         TSF_SecureMessaging realizes a secure communication channel.
         TSF_Auth realizes two authentication mechanisms: PIN verification and alternatively authentication
          with the PACE protocol.
         TSF_Integrity protects the integrity of internal applet data like the Access control lists.
         TSF_OS contains all security functionalities provided by the certified platform (IC, Javacard opera-
          tion system). The cryptographic operations needed for this TOE are provided by the platform:
              o   Electronic signature-generation (and key generation) with RSA and key sizes of 2000 up to
                  4096 bit in steps of 1 bit, or ECDSA with key sizes of key sizes of 160 bit to 521 bit in steps
                  of one bit.
              o   Secure messaging with AES (128, 192 or 256 bit key length).
              o   PACE authentication with key lengths of 160 bit to 521 bit in steps of one bit (ECC).

1.4.7 TOE life cycle
This paragraph is based on the protection profile [PP0059].

1.4.7.1    General
The TOE life cycle distinguishes stages for development, production, preparation and operational use. The
development and production of the TOE (cf. CC part 1 [CC_1], para.139) together constitute the develop-
ment phase of the TOE.



4 In the context of this security target the three categories are defined as follows: initialization comprises
the preparation of the TOE based on proprietary operations of the platform with the Java Card operation
system; pre-personalization comprises the configuration of the card manager and security domains as well
as the generation of applet instances using Global Platform commands. Personalization is carried out after-
wards using commands of the applet layer of the TOE.

TOE preparation and deletion of certificate info when SCD is destroyed are optional. The delivery to the
SSCD provisioning service after the development phase is also the end of the scope of the certification ac-
cording to Common Criteria.



The operational usage of the TOE comprises the preparation stage and the operational use stage. The TOE
operational use stage begins when the signatory performs the TOE operation to enable it for use in signing
operations. Enabling the TOE for signing requires at least one keyset of SCD stored in its memory.
The TOE life cycle ends when all keys stored in it have been rendered permanently unusable. Rendering a
key in the SSCD unusable may include deletion of any stored corresponding certificate info. The lifecycle
may allow generation of SCD or SCD/SVD key pairs after delivery to the signatory as well.

1.4.7.2   Preparation stage
An SSCD-provisioning service provider having accepted the TOE from a manufacturer prepares the TOE for
use and delivers it to its legitimate user. The preparation phase ends when the legitimate user of the TOE,
having received it from an SSCD-provisioning service and any SCD it might already hold have been enabled

for use in signing. During preparation of the TOE, as specified above, an SSCD-provisioning service provider
performs the following tasks:
       Create and configure the signature application according to AGD_PRE; this step involves applet in-
        stanciation as well as creation of the file system (card profile).5
       Obtain information on the intended recipient of the device as required for the preparation process
        and for identification as a legitimate user of the TOE.
       Generate a PIN and/or obtain a biometric sample of the legitimate user, store this data as RAD in
        the TOE and prepare information about the VAD for delivery to the legitimate user.
       Generate a certificate for at least one SCD either by:
        a) The TOE generating an SCD/SVD pair and obtaining a certificate for the SVD exported from the
           TOE, or
        b) Initializing security functions in the TOE for protected export of the SVD and obtaining a certifi-
           cate for the SVD after receiving a protected request from the TOE,
       Optionally, present certificate info to the SSCD.
       Deliver the TOE and the accompanying VAD info to the legitimate user.
The SVD certification task (fourth list item above) of an SSCD-provisioning service provider as specified in
this security target may support a centralised, pre-issuing key generation process, with at least one key
generated and certified, before delivery to the legitimate user. Alternatively, or additionally, that task may
support key generation by the signatory after delivery and outside the secure preparation environment. A
TOE may support both key generation processes, for example with a first key generated centrally and addi-
tional keys generated by the signatory in the operational use stage.
Data required for inclusion in the SVD certificate at least includes ([Directive], Annex II):
       the SVD which correspond to SCD under the control of the signatory;
       the name of the signatory or a pseudonym, which is to be identified as such;
       an indication of the beginning and end of the period of validity of the certificate.

The data included in the certificate may have been stored in the SSCD during personalization.
Before initiating the actual certificate signature the certificate-generating application verifies the SVD re-
ceived from the TOE by:
       establishing the sender as genuine SSCD
       establishing the integrity of the SVD to be certified as sent by the originating SSCD,
       establishing that the originating SSCD has been personalized for the legitimate user,
       establishing correspondence between SCD and SVD, and
       an assertion that the signing algorithm and key size for the SVD are approved and appropriate for
        the type of certificate.
The proof of correspondence between an SCD stored in the TOE and an SVD may be implicit in the security
mechanisms applied by the CGA. Optionally, the TOE may support a function to provide an explicit proof of
correspondence between an SCD it stores and an SVD realized by self-certification. Such a function may be
performed implicitly in the SVD export function and may be invoked in the preparation environment with-
out explicit consent of the signatory. Security requirements to protect the SVD export function and the

5 This preparation step has been added to the life cycle definition of the underlying Protection Profile and
is necessary to provide the basic functionality (i.e. application and file system) for the following steps. It
may be performed by the SSCD-provisioning service provider directly or by a separate entity (card manu-
facturer).

certification data if the SVD is generated by the signatory and then exported from the SSCD to the CGA are
specified are not part of this security target.
Prior to generating the certificate the certification service provider asserts the identity of the signatory
specified in the certification request as the legitimate user of the TOE.

1.4.7.3   Operational use stage
In this lifecycle stage the signatory can use the TOE to create advanced electronic signatures.
The TOE operational use stage begins when the signatory has obtained both the VAD and the TOE. Enabling
the TOE for signing requires at least one set of SCD stored in its memory.
The signatory can also interact with the SSCD to perform management tasks, e.g. reset a RAD value or use
counter if the password/PIN in the reference data has been lost or blocked. Such management tasks require
a secure environment.
The signatory can render an SCD in the TOE permanently unusable. Rendering the last SCD in the TOE per-
manently unusable ends the life of the TOE as SSCD.
The TOE may support functions to generate additional signing keys. If the TOE supports these functions it
will support further functions to securely obtain certificates for the new keys. For an additional key the
signatory may be allowed to choose the kind of certificate (qualified, or not) to obtain for the SVD of the
new key. The signatory may also be allowed to choose some of the data in the certificate request for in-
stance to use a pseudonym instead of the legal name in the certificate7. If the conditions to obtain a quali-
fied certificate are met the new key can also be used to create advanced electronic signatures. The optional
TOE functions for additional key generation and certification may require additional security functions in
the TOE and an interaction with the SSCD-Provisioning service provider in an environment that is secure.
The TOE life cycle as SSCD ends when all set of SCD stored in the TOE are destructed. This may include
deletion of the corresponding certificates.

2.2.5 Assessment of Platform Organisational Security Policies
The Organisational Security Policy “OSP.VERIFICATION” focuses on the integrity of loaded applets, which is
fulfilled by the TOE of this ST since the applet is loaded secured by platform security measures into the flash
memory. This policy does not contradict to the policies of this ST.
The platform ST contains the Organisational Security Policy “OSP.PROCESS-TOE” referring to accurate iden-
tification of each TOE instance. This policy will be fulfilled by a distinct product code for the platform and
for the composite TOE each. This policy does not contradict to the policies of this ST.
The Organisational Security Policy “OSP.KEY-CHANGE” states that initial security domain keys (APSD) shall
be changed before any operation on its Security Domain. This policy does not contradict to the policies of
this ST.
The Organisational Security Policy “OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS” states that security domains can be dynami-
cally created, deleted and blocked during usage phase in post-issuance mode. This policy does not contra-
dict to the policies of this ST.
The Organisational Security Policy “OSP.SECURE-BOX” focuses on the secure box mechanism, which is not
used by the TOE. This policy does not contradict to the policies of this ST.

2.2.6 Assessment of Platform Operational Environment

2.2.6.1   Assessment of Platform Assumptions
In the first column, the following table lists all assumptions of the Platform ST. The last column provides an
explanation of relevance for the Composite TOE.


 Platform Assumption                  Relevance for Composite ST
 A.APPLET                             A.APPLET states that applets loaded post-issuance do not contain na-
                                      tive methods. This assumption leads to appropriate directives in the
                                      user guidance [Guidance].
 A.VERIFICATION                       This assumption targets the applet code verification. Regarding post-
                                      issuance loading of third party applets, this assumption leads to ap-
                                      propriate directives in the user guidance [Guidance].
 A.USE_DIAG                           A.USE_DIAG is required in the platform ST to cover secure communi-
                                      cation during packaging, finishing and personalisation. This is re-
                                      flected by appropriate measures in the production and delivery of the
                                      TOE of this ST.
 A.USE_KEYS                           A.USE_KEYS assumes that that the keys which are stored outside the
                                      TOE and which are used for secure communication and authentica-
                                      tion between smart card and terminals are protected for confidenti-
                                      ality and integrity in their own storage environment.
                                      This assumption leads to appropriate directives in the user guidance
                                      [Guidance].
 A.PROCESS-SEC-IC                     A.PPROCESS-SEC-IC of the platform ST states that it is assumed that
                                      security procedures are used after delivery of the TOE by the TOE
                                      Manufacturer up to delivery to the end consumer to maintain confi-
                                      dentiality and integrity of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test
                                      data (to prevent any possible copy, modification, retention, theft or
                                      unauthorised use). This means that the phases after TOE delivery are
                                      assumed to be protected appropriately.
                                      This is reflected by appropriate measures in the production and deliv-
                                      ery of the TOE of this ST.
 A.APPS-PROVIDER                      A.APPS-PROVIDER assumes that the application provider is a trusted
                                      actor that provides basic or secure applications, and that the ap-
                                      plicatrion provider is resposible for his security domain keys.
                                      This leads to appropriate directives in the user guidance [Guidance].
 A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY             A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY assumes that the verification authority is
                                      a trusted actor and able to guarantee and check the digital signature
                                      attached to a basic or secure application. This is reflected by appro-
                                      priate directives in the user guidance [Guidance].

2.2.6.2   Assessment of Platform Objectives for the Operational Environment
There are the following Platform Objectives for the Operational Environment that have to be considered.

OE.APPLET                                                  The platform objective for the environment states
                                                           that applets loaded post-issuance do not contain
                                                           native methods. This objective for the environ-
                                                           ment leads to appropriate directives in the user
                                                           guidance [Guidance].
OE.VERIFICATION                                            The platform objective for the environment tar-

                                                           the TOE of this ST; regarding third-party-code, this
                                                           objective for the environment leads to appropri-

                                                           There it is stated that all applets loaded to the TOE
                                                           have to be verified.

3 Security problem definition
This chapter has been taken from [PP0059] with minor modifications.


3.1 Assets, users and threat agents
The Common Criteria define assets as entities that the owner of the TOE presumably places value upon. The
term “asset” is used to describe the threats in the operational environment of the TOE.
Assets and objects:
    1. SCD: private key used to perform an electronic signature operation. The confidentiality, integrity
       and signatory’s sole control over the use of the SCD must be maintained.
    2. SVD: public key linked to the SCD and used to perform electronic signature verification. The integrity
       of the SVD when it is exported must be maintained.
    3. DTBS and DTBS/R: set of data, or its representation, which the signatory intends to sign. Their in-
       tegrity and the unforgeability of the link to the signatory provided by the electronic signature must
       be maintained.
User and subjects acting for users:
    1. User: End user of the TOE who can be identified as Administrator or Signatory. The subject S.User
       may act as S.Admin in the role R.Admin or as S.Sigy in the role R.Sigy.
    2. Administrator: User who is in charge to perform the TOE initialisation, TOE personalisation or other
       TOE administrative functions. The subject S.Admin is acting in the role R.Admin for this user after
       successful authentication as Administrator.
    3. Signatory: User who hold the TOE and use it on their own behalf or on behalf of the natural or legal
       person or entity they represent. The subject S.Sigy is acting in the role R.Sigy for this user after
       successful authentication as Signatory.
Threat agents:
    1. Attacker: Human or process acting on their behalf located outside the TOE. The main goal of the
       attacker is to access the SCD or to falsify the electronic signature. The attacker has got a high attack
       potential and knows no secret.


3.2 Threats

3.2.1 T.SCD_Divulg: Storing, copying, and releasing of the signature-creation data
An attacker stores or copies the SCD outside the TOE. An attacker can obtain the SCD during generation,
storage and use for signature-creation in the TOE.

3.2.2 T.SCD_Derive: Derive the signature-creation data
An attacker derives the SCD from publicly known data, such as SVD corresponding to the SCD or signatures
created by means of the SCD or any other data exported outside the TOE, which is a threat against the
secrecy of the SCD.

3.2.3 T.Hack_Phys: Physical attacks through the TOE interfaces
An attacker interacts physically with the TOE to exploit vulnerabilities, resulting in arbitrary security com-
promises. This threat is directed against SCD, SVD and DTBS.

NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 – SSCD with Key Generation Security Target Lite


3.2.4 T.SVD_Forgery: Forgery of the signature-verification data
An attacker forges the SVD presented by the CSP to the CGA. This results in loss of SVD integrity in the
certificate of the signatory.

3.2.5 T.SigF_Misuse: Misuse of the signature-creation function of the TOE
An attacker misuses the signature-creation function of the TOE to create a SDO for data the signatory has
not decided to sign. The TOE is subject to deliberate attacks by experts possessing a high attack potential
with advanced knowledge of security principles and concepts employed by the TOE.

3.2.6 T.DTBS_Forgery: Forgery of the DTBS/R
An attacker modifies the DTBS/R sent by the SCA. Thus the DTBS/R used by the TOE for signing does not
match the DTBS the signatory intended to sign.

3.2.7 T.Sig_Forgery: Forgery of the electronic signature
An attacker forges a signed data object, maybe using an electronic signature which has been created by the
TOE, and the violation of the integrity of the signed data object is not detectable by the signatory or by third
parties. The signature created by the TOE is subject to deliberate attacks by experts possessing a high attack
potential with advanced knowledge of security principles and concepts employed by the TOE.


3.3 Organisational Security Policies

3.3.1 P.CSP_QCert: Qualified certificate
The CSP uses a trustworthy CGA to generate a qualified certificate or non-qualified certificate ([Directive]:
2:9, Annex I) for the SVD generated by the SSCD. The certificates contain at least the name of the signatory
and the SVD matching the SCD implemented in the TOE under sole control of the signatory. The CSP ensures
that the use of the TOE as SSCD is evident with signatures through the certificate or other publicly available
information.

3.3.2 P.QSign: Qualified electronic signatures
The signatory uses a signature-creation system to sign data with an advanced electronic signature ([Di-
rective]: 1, 2), which is a qualified electronic signature if it is based on a valid qualified certificate ([Directive],
Annex I). The DTBS are presented to the signatory and sent by the SCA as DTBS/R to the SSCD. The SSCD
creates the electronic signature created with a SCD implemented in the SSCD that the signatory maintain
under their sole control and is linked to the DTBS/R in such a manner that any subsequent change of the
data is detectable.

3.3.3 P.Sigy_SSCD: TOE as secure signature-creation device
The TOE meets the requirements for an SSCD laid down in [Directive], Annex III This implies the SCD is used
for electronic signature creation under sole control of the signatory and the SCD can practically occur only
once.

3.3.4 P.Sig_Non-Repud: Non-repudiation of signatures
The life cycle of the SSCD, the SCD and the SVD shall be implemented in a way that the signatory is not able
to deny having signed data if the signature is successfully verified with the SVD contained in their unrevoked
certificate.


3.4 Assumptions

3.4.1 A.CGA: Trustworthy certificate-generation application
The CGA protects the authenticity of the signatory’s name or pseudonym and the SVD in the (qualified)
certificate by an advanced electronic signature of the CSP.

3.4.2 A.SCA: Trustworthy signature-creation application
The signatory uses only a trustworthy SCA. The SCA generates and sends the DTBS/R of the data the signa-
tory wishes to sign in a form appropriate for signing by the TOE.

4 Security Objectives

4.1 Security Objectives for the TOE

4.1.1 OT.Lifecycle_Security: Lifecycle security
The TOE shall detect flaws during the initialisation, personalisation and operational usage. The TOE shall
securely destroy the SCD on demand of the signatory.
PP application note 1: The TOE may contain more than one set of SCD. There is no need to destroy the SCD
in case of repeated SCD generation. The signatory shall be able to destroy the SCD stored in the SSCD e.g.
after the (qualified) certificate for the corresponding SVD has been expired.

4.1.2 OT.SCD/SVD_Auth_Gen: Authorised SCD/SVD generation
The TOE shall provide security features to ensure that authorised users only may invoke the generation of
the SCD and the SVD.

4.1.3 OT.SCD_Unique: Uniqueness of the signature-creation data
The TOE shall ensure the cryptographic quality of an SCD/SVD pair it creates as suitable for the advanced or
qualified electronic signature. The SCD used for signature creation shall practically occur only once and shall
not be reconstructable from the SVD. In that context ‘practically occur once’ means that the probability of
equal SCDs is negligible.

4.1.4 OT.SCD_SVD_Corresp: Correspondence between SVD and SCD
The TOE shall ensure the correspondence between the SVD and the SCD generated by the TOE. This includes
unambiguous reference of a created SVD/SCD pair for export of the SVD and in creating an electronic sig-
nature creation with the SCD.

4.1.5 OT.SCD_Secrecy: Secrecy of the signature-creation data
The secrecy of the SCD (used for signature creation) shall be reasonably assured against attacks with a high
attack potential.
PP application note 2: The TOE shall keep the confidentiality of the SCD at all times in particular during
SCD/SVD generation, SCD signature creation operation, storage and secure destruction.

4.1.6 OT.Sig_Secure: Cryptographic security of the electronic signature
The TOE shall create digital signatures that cannot be forged without knowledge of the SCD through robust
encryption techniques. The SCD shall not be reconstructable using the digital signatures or any other data
exportable from the TOE. The digital signatures shall be resistant against these attacks, even when executed
with a high attack potential.

4.1.7 OT.Sigy_SigF: Signature creation function for the legitimate signatory only
The TOE shall provide the digital signature creation function for the legitimate signatory only and protects
the SCD against the use of others. The TOE shall resist attacks with high attack potential.

4.1.8 OT.DTBS_Integrity_TOE: DTBS/R integrity inside the TOE
The TOE must not alter the DTBS/R. As by definition of the DTBS/R this may consist of the DTBS themselves,
this objective does not conflict with a signature creation process where the TOE hashes the provided DTBS
(in part or entirely) for signature creation.

4.1.9 OT.EMSEC_Design: Provide physical-emanation security
The TOE shall be designed and built in such a way as to control the production of intelligible emanations
within specified limits.

4.1.10 OT.Tamper_ID: Tamper detection
The TOE shall provide system features that detect physical tampering of its components, and uses those
features to limit security breaches.

4.1.11 OT.Tamper_Resistance: Tamper resistance
The TOE shall prevent or resist physical tampering with specified system devices and components.


4.2 Security Objectives for the Operational Environment

4.2.1 OE.SVD_Auth: Authenticity of the SVD
The operational environment shall ensure the integrity of the SVD sent to the CGA of the CSP. The CGA
verifies the correspondence between the SCD in the SSCD of the signatory and the SVD in the qualified
certificate.

4.2.2 OE.CGA_QCert: Generation of qualified certificates
The CGA shall generate a qualified certificate that includes (amongst others)

    (a) the name of the signatory controlling the TOE,
    (b) the SVD matching the SCD stored in the TOE and being under sole control of the signatory,
    (c) the advanced signature of the CSP.

The CGA shall confirm with the generated qualified certificate that the SCD corresponding to the SVD is
stored in a SSCD.

4.2.3 OE.SSCD_Prov_Service: Authentic SSCD provided by SSCD Provisioning Service
The SSCD-provisioning service shall initialise and personalise for the signatory an authentic copy of the TOE
and deliver this copy as SSCD to the signatory.

4.2.4 OE.HID_VAD: Protection of the VAD
If an external device provides the human interface for user authentication, this device shall ensure confi-
dentiality and integrity of the VAD as needed by the authentication method employed from import through
its human interface until import through the TOE interface. In particular, if the TOE requires a trusted chan-
nel for import of the VAD, the HID shall support usage of this trusted channel.

4.2.5 OE.DTBS_Intend: SCA sends data intended to be signed
The Signatory shall use a trustworthy SCA that
       generates the DTBS/R of the data that has been presented as DTBS and which the signatory intends
        to sign in a form which is appropriate for signing by the TOE,
       sends the DTBS/R to the TOE and enables verification of the integrity of the DTBS/R by the TOE,
       attaches the signature produced by the TOE to the data or provides it separately.


Application note 3: The SCA should be able to support advanced electronic signatures. Currently, there exist
three formats defined by ETSI recognized as meeting the requirements needed by advanced electronic sig-
natures: CAdES, XAdES and PAdES. These three formats mandate to include the hash of the signer's public
key certificate in the data to be signed. In order to support for the mobility of the signer, it is recommended
to store the certificate info on the SSCD for use by SCA and identification of the corresponding SCD if more
than one SCD is stored on the SSCD.

4.2.6 OE.DTBS_Protect: SCA protects the data intended to be signed
The operational environment shall ensure that the DTBS/R cannot be altered in transit between the SCA
and the TOE. In particular, if the TOE requires a trusted channel for import of the DTBS/R, the SCA shall
support usage of this trusted channel.

4.2.7 OE.Signatory: Security obligation of the Signatory
The signatory shall check that the SCD stored in the SSCD received from SSCD-provisioning service is in non-
operational state. The signatory shall keep their VAD confidential.

               Table 9: Mapping of threats, policies and assumptions to the security objectives.

4.3.2 Security Objectives Sufficiency
Countering of threats by security objectives:

T.SCD_Divulg (Storing, copying and releasing of the signature creation data) addresses the threat against
the legal validity of electronic signature due to storage and copying of SCD outside the TOE, as expressed in
recital (18) of [Directive]. This threat is countered by OT.SCD_Secrecy, which assures the secrecy of the SCD
used for signature creation.
T.SCD_Derive (Derive the signature creation data) deals with attacks on the SCD via public known data pro-
duced by the TOE, which are the SVD and the signatures created with the SCD. OT.SCD/SVD_Auth_Gen
counters this threat by implementing cryptographically secure generation of the SCD/SVD pair.
OT.Sig_Secure ensures cryptographically secure electronic signatures.
T.Hack_Phys (Exploitation of physical vulnerabilities) deals with physical attacks exploiting physical vulner-
abilities of the TOE. OT.SCD_Secrecy preserves the secrecy of the SCD. OT.EMSEC_Design counters physical
attacks through the TOE interfaces and observation of TOE emanations. OT.Tamper_ID and
OT.Tamper_Resistance counter the threat T.Hack_Phys by detecting and by resisting tampering attacks.
T.SVD_Forgery (Forgery of the signature verification data) deals with the forgery of the SVD exported by
the TOE to the CGA for certificate generation. T.SVD_Forgery is addressed by OT.SCD_SVD_Corresp, which
ensures correspondence between SVD and SCD and unambiguous reference of the SVD/SCD pair for the
SVD export and signature creation with the SCD, and OE.SVD_Auth that ensures the integrity of the SVD
exported by the TOE to the CGA.
T.SigF_Misuse (Misuse of the signature creation function of the TOE) addresses the threat of misuse of the
TOE signature creation function to create SDO by others than the signatory to create an electronic signature
on data for which the signatory has not expressed the intent to sign, as required by paragraph 1(c) of [Di-
rective], Annex III. OT.Lifecycle_Security (Lifecycle security) requires the TOE to detect flaws during the ini-
tialisation, personalisation and operational usage including secure destruction of the SCD, which may be
initiated by the signatory. OT.Sigy_SigF (Signature creation function for the legitimate signatory only) en-
sures that the TOE provides the signature creation function for the legitimate signatory only.
OE.DTBS_Intend (Data intended to be signed) ensures that the SCA sends the DTBS/R only for data the sig-
natory intends to sign and OE.DTBS_Protect counters manipulation of the DTBS during transmission over

                                                                                                                                              40 of 82
NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 – SSCD with Key Generation Security Target Lite


the channel between the SCA and the TOE. OT.DTBS_Integrity_TOE (DTBS/R integrity inside the TOE) pre-
vents the DTBS/R from alteration inside the TOE. If the SCA provides a human interface for user authenti-
cation, OE.HID_VAD (Protection of the VAD) provides confidentiality and integrity of the VAD as needed by
the authentication method employed. OE.Signatory ensures that the signatory checks that an SCD stored in
the SSCD when received from an SSCD-provisioning service provider is in non-operational state, i.e. the SCD
cannot be used before the signatory becomes control over the SSCD. OE.Signatory ensures also that the
signatory keeps their VAD confidential.
T.DTBS_Forgery (Forgery of the DTBS/R) addresses the threat arising from modifications of the data sent as
input to the TOE's signature creation function that does not represent the DTBS as presented to the signa-
tory and for which the signature has expressed its intent to sign. The TOE IT environment addresses
T.DTBS_Forgery by the means of OE.DTBS_Intend, which ensures that the trustworthy SCA generates the
DTBS/R of the data that has been presented as DTBS and which the signatory intends to sign in a form
appropriate for signing by the TOE, and by means of OE.DTBS_Protect, which ensures that the DTBS/R can-
not be altered in transit between the SCA and the TOE. The TOE counters this threat by the means of
OT.DTBS_Integrity_TOE by ensuring the integrity of the DTBS/R inside the TOE.
T.Sig_Forgery (Forgery of the electronic signature) deals with non-detectable forgery of the electronic sig-
nature. OT.Sig_Secure, OT.SCD_Unique and OE.CGA_QCert address this threat in general. OT.Sig_Secure
(Cryptographic security of the electronic signature) ensures by means of robust cryptographic techniques
that the signed data and the electronic signature are securely linked together. OT.SCD_Unique and ensures
that the same SCD cannot be generated more than once and the corresponding SVD cannot be included in
another certificate by chance. OE.CGA_QCert prevents forgery of the certificate for the corresponding SVD,
which would result in false verification decision concerning a forged signature.


Enforcement of OSPs by security objectives:

P.CSP_QCert (CSP generates qualified certificates) establishes the CSP generating qualified certificate or
non-qualified certificate linking the signatory and the SVD implemented in the SSCD under sole control of
this signatory. P.CSP_QCert is addressed by
    —   OT.Lifecycle_Security, which requires the TOE to detect flaws during the initialisation, personalisa-
        tion and operational usage,
    —   OT.SCD_SVD_Corresp, which requires to ensure the correspondence between the SVD and the SCD
        during their generation,
    —   OE.CGA_QCert for generation of qualified certificates or non-qualified certificates, which requires
        the CGA to certify the SVD matching the SCD implemented in the TOE under sole control of the
        signatory.

P.QSign (Qualified electronic signatures) provides that the TOE and the SCA may be employed to sign data
with an advanced electronic signature, which is a qualified electronic signature if based on a valid qualified
certificate. OT.Sigy_SigF ensures signatory’s sole control of the SCD by requiring the TOE to provide the
signature creation function for the legitimate signatory only and to protect the SCD against the use of oth-
ers. OT.Sig_Secure ensures that the TOE creates electronic signatures, which cannot be forged without
knowledge of the SCD through robust encryption techniques. OE.CGA_QCert addresses the requirement of
qualified or non-qualified electronic certificates building a base for the electronic signature.
OE.DTBS_Intend ensures that the SCA provides only those DTBS to the TOE, which the signatory intends to
sign.
P.Sigy_SSCD (TOE as secure signature creation device) requires the TOE to meet [Directive], Annex III. This
is ensured as follows:



                                                    41 of 82
NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 – SSCD with Key Generation Security Target Lite


    —   OT.SCD_Unique meets the paragraph 1(a) of [Directive], Annex III, by the requirements that the SCD
        used for signature creation can practically occur only once;
    —   OT.SCD_Unique, OT.SCD_Secrecy and OT.Sig_Secure meet the requirement in paragraph 1(a) of
        [Directive], Annex III by the requirements to ensure secrecy of the SCD. OT.EMSEC_Design and
        OT.Tamper_Resistance address specific objectives to ensure secrecy of the SCD against specific at-
        tacks;
    —   OT.SCD_Secrecy and OT.Sig_Secure meet the requirement in paragraph 1(b) of Annex III by the re-
        quirements to ensure that the SCD cannot be derived from SVD, the electronic signatures or any
        other data exported outside the TOE;
    —   OT.Sigy_SigF meets the requirement in paragraph 1(c) of [Directive], Annex III by the requirements
        to ensure that the TOE provides the signature creation function for the legitimate signatory only
        and protects the SCD against the use of others;
    —   OT.DTBS_Integrity_TOE meets the requirements in paragraph 2 of [Directive], Annex III as the TOE
        must not alter the DTBS/R.
Paragraph 2 of Annex III, requires that an SSCD does not prevent the data to be signed from being presented
to the signatory prior to the signature process is obviously fulfilled by the method of TOE usage: the SCA
will present the DTBS to the signatory and send it to the SSCD for signing.
The usage of SCD under sole control of the signatory is ensured by
    —   OT.Lifecycle_Security requiring the TOE to detect flaws during the initialisation, personalisation and
        operational usage,
    —   OT.SCD/SVD_Auth_Gen, which limits invocation of the generation of the SCD and the SVD to au-
        thorised users only, and
    —   OT.Sigy_SigF, which requires the TOE to provide the signature creation function for the legitimate
        signatory only and to protect the SCD against the use of others.

OE.SSCD_Prov_Service ensures that the signatory obtains an authentic copy of the TOE, initialised and per-
sonalised SSCD from an SSCD-provisioning service.
P.Sig_Non-Repud (Non-repudiation of signatures) deals with the repudiation of signed data by the signa-
tory, although the electronic signature is successfully verified with the SVD contained in their certificate
valid at the time of signature creation. This policy is implemented by the combination of the security objec-
tives for the TOE and its operational environment, which ensures the aspects of signatory’s sole control
over and responsibility for the electronic signatures created with the TOE.
OE.SSCD_Prov_Service ensures that the signatory obtains an authentic copy of the TOE, initialised and per-
sonalised as SSCD from the SSCD-provisioning service.
OE.CGA_QCert ensures that the certificate allows to identify the signatory and thus to link the SVD to the
signatory. OE.SVD_Auth and OE.CGA_QCert require the environment to ensure authenticity of the SVD as
being exported by the TOE and used under sole control of the signatory. OT.SCD_SVD_Corresp ensures that
the SVD exported by the TOE corresponds to the SCD that is implemented in the TOE. OT.SCD_Unique pro-
vides that the signatory’s SCD can practically occur just once.
OE.Signatory ensures that the signatory checks that the SCD, stored in the SSCD received from an SSCD-
provisioning service is in non-operational state (i.e. the SCD cannot be used before the signatory becomes
into sole control over the SSCD). OT.Sigy_SigF provides that only the signatory may use the TOE for signature
creation. As prerequisite OE.Signatory ensures that the signatory keeps their VAD confidential.
OE.DTBS_Intend, OE.DTBS_Protect and OT.DTBS_Integrity_TOE ensure that the TOE creates electronic sig-
natures only for those DTBS/R, which the signatory has decided to sign as DTBS. The robust cryptographic
techniques required by OT.Sig_Secure ensure that only this SCD may create a valid electronic signature that


                                                    42 of 82
NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 – SSCD with Key Generation Security Target Lite


can be successfully verified with the corresponding SVD used for signature verification. The security objec-
tive for the TOE OT.Lifecycle_Security (Lifecycle security), OT.SCD_Secrecy (Secrecy of the signature creation
data), OT.EMSEC_Design (Provide physical emanations security), OT.Tamper_ID (Tamper detection) and
OT.Tamper_Resistance (Tamper resistance) protect the SCD against any compromise.


Upkeep of assumptions by security objectives:

A.SCA (Trustworthy signature creation application) establishes the trustworthiness of the SCA with respect
to generation of DTBS/R. This is addressed by OE.DTBS_Intend (Data intended to be signed) which ensures
that the SCA generates the DTBS/R of the data that have been presented to the signatory as DTBS and which
the signatory intends to sign in a form which is appropriate for being signed by the TOE.
A.CGA (Trustworthy certificate generation application) establishes the protection of the authenticity of the
signatory's name and the SVD in the qualified certificate by the advanced signature of the CSP by means of
the CGA. This is addressed by OE.CGA_QCert (Generation of qualified certificates), which ensures the gen-
eration of qualified certificates, and by OE.SVD_Auth (Authenticity of the SVD), which ensures the protec-
tion of the integrity of the received SVD and the verification of the correspondence between the SVD and
the SCD that is implemented by the SSCD of the signatory.

5 Extended Component Definition

5.1 Definition of the Family FPT_EMS
The additional family FPT_EMS (TOE Emanation) of the Class FPT (Protection of the TSF) is defined here to
describe the IT security functional requirements of the TOE. The TOE shall prevent attacks against the SCD
and other secret data where the attack is based on external observable physical phenomena of the TOE.
Examples of such attacks are evaluation of TOE’s electromagnetic radiation, simple power analysis (SPA),
differential power analysis (DPA), timing attacks, radio emanation etc. This family describes the functional
requirements for the limitation of intelligible emanations. The family FPT_EMS belongs to the Class FPT
because it is the class for TSF protection. Other families within the Class FPT do not cover the TOE emana-
tion. The definition of the family FPT_EMS is taken from the Protection Profile Secure Signature Creation
Device [PP0006].

6 IT Security Requirements

6.1 General
This chapter gives the security functional requirements and the security assurance requirements for the
TOE.
Section 6.2 provides the security functional requirements.
The TOE security assurance requirements statement is given in section 6.3.


6.2 TOE Security Functional Requirements

6.2.1 Use of requirement specifications
The CC allows several operations to be performed on functional requirements; refinement, selection, as-
signment, and iteration are defined in paragraph C.4 of Part 1 [CC_1] of the CC. Each of these operations is
used in this ST and the underlying PP.
Operations already performed in the underlying PP [PP0059] are uniformly marked by bold italic font style;
for further information on details of the operation, please refer to [PP0059].
Operations performed within this security target are marked by bold underlined font style; further infor-
mation on details of the operation is provided in foot notes.

6.2.2 Cryptographic support (FCS)
Application note 4: Member states of the European Union have specified entities as responsible for accred-
itation and supervision of the evaluation process for products conforming to this standard and for deter-
mining admissible algorithms and algorithm parameters ([Directive]: 1.1b and 3.4).

                                           BSI-TR-03110 [TR03110].


Application note: It must be underlined that the SFR FCS_COP.1/PACE SFR is only required for variants with
a contactless interface. The specification of the AES can be found in [FIPS197].
Application note: The elliptic curves corresponding to the key sizes are defined in FCS_CKM.1.
Application note: BSI-TR-03110 [TR03110] allows arbitrary combinations of ECC key sizes and AES key
lengths in the PACE protocol. It should be noted that ECC key lengths smaller than the AES key length will
lead to a reduced AES key space (e.g. a 224 bit entropy in a 256 bit AES key).

Application note: This SFR was added to the standard set of SFRs to address the requirements of the PACE
protocol. The random number generation is provided by the underlying NXP JCOP4 P71 platform.
Developer note: The corresponding platform SFR (FCS_RNG.1) states that the platform provides a deter-
ministic random number generator (RNG) that fulfills the following:
         (DRG.3.1) If initialized with a random seed using a PTRNG of class PTG.2 (as defined in [AIS20]) as
          random source, the internal state of the RNG shall have at least 256 bit of entropy.
         (DRG.3.2) The RNG provides forward secrecy (as defined in [AIS20]).
         (DRG.3.3) The RNG provides enhanced backward secrecy even if the current internal state is
          known (as defined in [AIS20])
         (DRG.3.4) The RNG, initialized with a random seed using a PTRNG of class PTG.2 (as defined in
          [AIS20]) as random source, generates output for which for AES-mode 248 and for TDEA-mode 235
          strings of bit length 128 are mutually different with probability at least 1 - 224.
         (DRG.3.5) Statistical test suites cannot practically distinguish the random numbers from output
          sequences of an ideal RNG. The random numbers must pass test procedure A (as defined in
          [AIS20]).

This ST does not require the TOE to protect the integrity and authenticity of the exported SVD public key
but requires such protection by the operational environment. If the operational environment does not pro-
vide sufficient security measures for the CGA to ensure the authenticity of the public key the TOE shall
implement additional security functions to support the export of public keys with integrity and data origin
authentication. See section 4.3 for additional requirements for use of an SSCD in an environment that can-
not provide such protection.

PP application note 13: <applied>
Application note: This SFR is met by TSF_Auth. Note that TSF_Auth contains two configurable mechanisms
(cf. chapter 7) based on the standard ISO7816 Verify_PIN command (for contact interface only) and on the
PACE protocol.
Developer note: The blocking of the RAD after the defined number of unsuccessful authentication attempts
can – depending on the configuration and the specific configuration data – be permanent or unblocked with
a personal unblocking key (PUK). The RAD should have a minimum of six digits. The probability to guess a
PIN value by repeated tries shall be equal or less than 3 x 10-6. An optional PUK should have a minimum
size of 10 digits and the usage counter of the PUK should be restricted to a maximum of 20. If a PUK is used,
the PUK shall be held secret or the RAD shall have a sufficient length to achieve that the probability to guess
a PIN value by repeated tries and PUK usage is equal or less than 3 x 10-6.

                                      and SCD.
PP application note 18: The TOE shall prevent attacks against the SCD and other secret data where the
attack is based on external observable physical phenomena of the TOE. Such attacks may be observable at
the interfaces of the TOE or may origin from internal operation of the TOE or may origin by an attacker that
varies the physical environment under which the TOE operates. The set of measurable physical phenomena
is influenced by the technology employed to implement the TOE. Examples of measurable phenomena are
variations in the power consumption, the timing of transitions of internal states, electromagnetic radiation
due to internal operation, radio emission.
Due to the heterogeneous nature of the technologies that may cause such emanations, evaluation against
state-of-the-art attacks applicable to the technologies employed by the TOE is assumed. Examples of such
attacks are, but are not limited to, evaluation of TOE’s electromagnetic radiation, simple power analysis
(SPA), differential power analysis (DPA), timing attacks, etc.

                                    forced.


PP application note 20: The TOE implements appropriate measures to continuously counter physical tam-
pering which may compromise the SCD. The “automatic response” in the element FPT_PHP.3.1 means (i)
assuming that there might be an attack at any time and (ii) countermeasures are provided at any time. Due
to the nature of these attacks the TOE can by no means detect attacks on all of its elements (e.g. the TOE is
destroyed). But physical tampering must not reveal information of the SCD. E.g. the TOE may be physically
tampered in power-off state of the TOE (e.g. a smart card), which does not allow TSF for overwriting the
SCD but leads to physical destruction of the memory and all information therein about the SCD. In case of
physical tampering the TFS may not provide the intended functions for SCD/SVD pair generation or signa-
ture-creation but ensures the confidentiality of the SCD by blocking these functions. The SFR FPT_PHP.1
requires the TSF to react on physical tampering in a way that the signatory is able to determine whether the
TOE was physical tampered or not. E.g. the TSF may provide an appropriate message during start-up or the
guidance documentation may describe a failure of TOE start-up as indication of physical tampering.

6.4.1.2   TOE Security Requirements Sufficiency
OT.Lifecycle_Security (Lifecycle security) is provided by the SFR for SCD/SVD generation FCS_CKM.1, SCD
usage FCS_COP.1/SIG and SCD destruction FCS_CKM.4 ensure cryptographically secure lifecycle of the SCD.
The SCD/SVD generation is controlled by TSF according to FDP_ACC.1/SCD/SVD_Generation and
FDP_ACF.1/SCD/SVD_Generation. The SVD transfer for certificate generation is controlled by TSF according
to FDP_ACC.1/SVD_Transfer and FDP_ACF.1/SVD_Transfer. The SCD usage is ensured by access control
FDP_ACC.1/Signature-creation, FDP_ACF.1/Signature-creation which is based on the security attribute se-
cure TSF management according to FMT_MOF.1, FMT_MSA.1/Admin, FMT_MSA.1/ Signatory, FMT_MSA.2,
FMT_MSA.3, FMT_MSA.4, FMT_MTD.1/Admin, FMT_MTD.1/Signatory, FMT_SMF.1 and FMT_SMR.1. The
test functions FPT_TST.1 provides failure detection throughout the lifecycle.
OT.SCD/SVD_Auth_Gen (Authorized SCD/SVD generation) addresses that generation of a SCD/SVD pair re-
quires proper user authentication. The TSF specified by FIA_UID.1 and FIA_UAU.1 provide user identification
and user authentication prior to enabling access to authorised functions. The SFR
FDP_ACC.1/SCD/SVD_Generation and FDP_ACF.1/SCD/SVD_Generation provide access control for the


                                                                      61 of 82

SCD/SVD generation. The security attributes of the authenticated user are provided by FMT_MSA.1/Admin,
FMT_MSA.2, and FMT_MSA.3 for static attribute initialisation. The SFR FMT_MSA.4 defines rules for inher-
itance of the security attribute “SCD operational” of the SCD.
OT.SCD_Unique (Uniqueness of the signature-creation data) implements the requirement of practically
unique SCD as laid down in [Directive], Annex III, paragraph 1(a) of [Directive], which is provided by the
cryptographic algorithms specified by FCS_CKM.1.
OT.SCD_SVD_Corresp (Correspondence between SVD and SCD) addresses that the SVD corresponds to the
SCD implemented by the TOE. This is provided by the algorithms specified by FCS_CKM.1 to generate cor-
responding SVD/SCD pairs. The security functions specified by FDP_SDI.2/Persistent ensure that the keys
are not modified, so to retain the correspondence. Moreover, the SCD Identifier allows the environment to
identify the SCD and to link it with the appropriate SVD. The management functions identified by
FMT_SMF.1 and by FMT_MSA.4 allow R.Admin to modify the default value of the security attribute SCD
Identifier.
OT.SCD_Secrecy (Secrecy of signature-creation data) is provided by the security functions specified by the
following SFR. FCS_CKM.1 ensures the use of secure cryptographic algorithms for SCD/SVD generation.
Cryptographic quality of SCD/SVD pair shall prevent disclosure of SCD by cryptographic attacks using the
publicly known SVD. The security functions specified by FDP_RIP.1 and FCS_CKM.4 ensure that residual in-
formation on SCD is destroyed after the SCD has been use for signature creation and that destruction of
SCD leaves no residual information.
The security functions specified by FDP_SDI.2/Persistent ensure that no critical data is modified which could
alter the efficiency of the security functions or leak information of the SCD. FPT_TST.1 tests the working
conditions of the TOE and FPT_FLS.1 guarantees a secure state when integrity is violated and thus assures
that the specified security functions are operational. An example where compromising error conditions are
countered by FPT_FLS.1 is fault injection for differential fault analysis (DFA).
SFR FPT_EMS.1 and FPT_PHP.3 require additional security features of the TOE to ensure the confidentiality
of the SCD.
OT.Sig_Secure (Cryptographic security of the electronic signature) is provided by the cryptographic algo-
rithms specified by FCS_COP.1/SIG, which ensures the cryptographic robustness of the signature algorithms.
FDP_SDI.2/Persistent corresponds to the integrity of the SCD implemented by the TOE and FPT_TST.1 en-
sure self-tests ensuring correct signature-creation..
OT.Sigy_SigF (Signature creation function for the legitimate signatory only) is provided by an SFR for iden-
tification authentication and access control.
FIA_UAU.1 and FIA_UID.1 ensure that no signature generation function can be invoked before the signatory
is identified and authenticated. The security functions specified by FMT_MTD.1/Admin and
FMT_MTD.1/Signatory manage the authentication function. SFR FIA_AFL.1 provides protection against a
number of attacks, such as cryptographic extraction of residual information, or brute force attacks against
authentication. The security function specified by FDP_SDI.2/DTBS ensures the integrity of stored DTBS and
FDP_RIP.1 prevents misuse of any resources containing the SCD after de-allocation (e.g. after the signature-
creation process).
The security functions specified by FDP_ACC.1/Signature-creation and FDP_ACF.1/Signature-creation pro-
vide access control based on the security attributes managed according to the SFR FMT_MTD.1/Signatory,
FMT_MSA.2, FMT_MSA.3 and FMT_MSA.4. The SFR FMT_SMF.1 and FMT_SMR.1 list these management
functions and the roles. These ensure that the signature process is restricted to the signatory. FMT_MOF.1
restricts the ability to enable the signature-creation function to the signatory. FMT_MSA.1/Signatory re-
stricts the ability to modify the security attributes SCD operational to the signatory.
For variants with a contactless interface, FCS_COP.1/PACE and FCS_RND.1 secure the transmission of the
RAD (e.g. PIN) and the set-up of a secure messaging channel. These SFRs are not required for other variants
of the TOE.

OT.DTBS_Integrity_TOE (DTBS/R integrity inside the TOE) ensures that the DTBS/R is not altered by the TOE.
The integrity functions specified by FDP_SDI.2/DTBS require that the DTBS/R has not been altered by the
TOE.
OT.EMSEC_Design (Provide physical emanations security) covers that no intelligible information is ema-
nated. This is provided by FPT_EMS.1.1.
OT.Tamper_ID (Tamper detection) is provided by FPT_PHP.1 by the means of passive detection of physical
attacks.
OT.Tamper_Resistance (Tamper resistance) is provided by FPT_PHP.3 to resist physical attacks.

Justification for non-satisfied dependencies between the SFR for TOE:
•       No. 1: The PACE authentication protocol uses specific RAD (e.g. a PIN) as equivalent of a crypto-
        graphic key. Therefore neither a key generation (FCS_CKM.1) nor an import (FDP_ITC.1/2) is neces-
        sary.

6.4.3 Rationale for EAL 5 Augmented
The assurance level for the protection profile [PP0059] is EAL4 augmented with AVA_VAN.5. This security
target enhances the security level by choosing EAL 5 augmented with AVA_VAN.5 and ALC_DVS.2 due to
market demands.
Augmentation results from the selection of:
                AVA_VAN.5 Advanced methodical vulnerability analysis
                ALC_DVS.2 Sufficiency of security measures
The TOE is intended to function in a variety of signature creation systems for qualified electronic signatures.
Due to the nature of its intended application, i.e., the TOE may be issued to users and may not be directly

under the control of trained and dedicated administrators. As a result, it is imperative that misleading, un-
reasonable and conflicting guidance is absent from the guidance documentation, and that secure proce-
dures for all modes of operation have been addressed. Insecure states should be easy to detect.
The TOE shall be shown to be highly resistant to penetration attacks to meet the security objectives
OT.SCD_Secrecy, OT.Sigy_SigF and OT.Sig_Secure. The component AVA_VAN.5 has the following depend-
encies:
       ADV_ARC.1 Architectural Design with domain separation and non-bypassability
       ADV_FSP.4 Complete functional specification
       ADV_TDS.3 Basic modular design
       ADV_IMP.1 Implementation representation of the TSF
       AGD_OPE.1 Operational user guidance
       AGD_PRE.1 Preparative procedures
       ATE_DPT.1 Testing: basic design
All of these dependencies are met or exceeded in the EAL5 assurance package.
The component ALC_DVS.2 has no dependencies.

7 TOE summary specification

7.1 Security Functionality

7.1.1 TSF_Access: Access rights
This security functionality manages the access to objects (files, directories, data and secrets) stored in the
applet’s file system. It also controls write access of initialization, pre-personalization and personalization
data. Access control for initialization and pre-personalization in the preparation phase – while the actual
applet is not yet present – is based on platform functionality and on the card manager of the underlying
JCOP4 P71 Java Card platform.
It allows among others the maintenance of different users (Administrator, Signatory). Access is granted (or
denied) in accordance to access rights that depend on appropriate identification and authentication mech-
anisms.
TSF_Access covers the following SFRs:
       FDP_ACC.1.1/SCD/SVD_Generation          requires    that     the    TSF     shall  enforce      the
        SCD/SVD_Generation_SFP on the (1) subjects: S.User, the (2) objects: signature creation data (SCD),
        signature verification data (SVD), and the (3) operations: generation of a SCD/SVD pair. Access to
        these operations is realized by TSF_Access (while user authentication is performed by TSF_Auth).
       FDP_ACC.1.1/SVD_Transfer requires that the TSF shall enforce the SVD_Transfer_SFP on (1) sub-
        jects: S.User, (2) objects: signature verification data (SVD), and (3) operations: export. Access to
        these operations is realized by TSF_Access (while user authentication is performed by TSF_Auth).
       FDP_ACC.1.1/Signature-creation requires that the TSF shall enforce the Signature Creation SFP on
        (1) subjects: S.User, (2) objects: DTBS/R, signature creation data (SCD), and (3) operations: signa-
        ture-creation. Access to these operations is realized by TSF_Access (while user authentication is
        performed by TSF_Auth).
       FDP_ACF.1.1/SCD/SVD_Generation         requires   that  the     TSF    shall     enforce     the

This security function realizes the following two configurable mechanisms based on the standard ISO7816
Verify_PIN command (for contact interface only) and on the PACE protocol:

       TSF_Auth_VERIFY_PIN
        TSF_Auth_PIN performs the VERIFY PIN (RAD) authentication mechanism.

       TSF_Auth_PACE
        TSF_Auth_PACE provides an additional authentication mechanism based on the PACE protocol
        [TR03110]. It is used for secure PIN entry especially over contactless interface. To prevent denial of
        service attacks on the PACE PIN (that could be performed unnoticed via contactless interface), the
        suspend mode as defined in TR03110 [TR03110] is used. After two consecutive unsuccessful PIN
        verification attempts the PIN will be suspended and can only be verified after successful verification
        of an additional PIN (e.g. Card Access Number, CAN).

       FDP_SDI.2.1/Persistent requires that the TSF shall monitor user data stored in containers controlled
        by the TSF for integrity error on all objects, based on the following attributes: integrity checked
        stored data. This is realized by TSF_Integrity and TSF_OS.
       FDP_SDI.2.2/Persistent requires that upon detection of a data integrity error, the TSF shall (1) pro-
        hibit the use of the altered data and (2) inform the S.Sigy about integrity error. This is realized by
        TSF_Integrity and TSF_OS.
       FDP_SDI.2.1/DTBS requires that the TSF shall monitor user data stored in containers controlled by
        the TSF for integrity error on all objects, based on the following attributes: integrity checked stored
        DTBS. This is realized by TSF_Integrity and TSF_OS.
       FDP_SDI.2.2/DTBS requires that upon detection of a data integrity error, the TSF shall (1) prohibit
        the use of the altered data and (2) inform the S.Sigy about integrity error. This is realized by
        TSF_Integrity and TSF_OS.
       FPT_EMS.1.1 requires that the TOE shall not variations in power consumption, electromagnetic ra-
        diation or timing during command execution in excess of non-useful information enabling access to
        RAD and SCD. This is mainly realized by appropriate measures in TSF_OS together with the strict
        following of the security implementation guidelines of the Javacard platform.
       FPT_EMS.1.2 requires that the TSF shall ensure any users are unable to use the following interface:
        smart card circuit contacts or contactless interface to gain access to RAD and SCD. This is mainly
        realized by appropriate measures in TSF_OS together with the strict following of the security imple-
        mentation guidelines of the Javacard platform.
       FPT_FLS.1.1 requires that the TSF shall preserve a secure state when the following types of failures
        occur: (1) self-test according to FPT_TST fails, or (2) exposure to out-of-range operating conditions
        where therefore a malfunction could occur. This is realized by TSF_OS (together with and
        TSF_Integrity).
       FPT_PHP.1.1 requires that the TSF shall provide unambiguous detection of physical tampering that
        might compromise the TSF. This all is realized by TSF_OS, in parts due to the characteristics of the
        hardware platform.
       FPT_PHP.1.2 requires that the TSF shall provide the capability to determine whether physical tam-
        pering with the TSF’s devices or TSF’s elements has occurred. This all is realized by TSF_OS, in parts
        due to the characteristics of the hardware platform.
       FPT_PHP.3.1 requires that the TSF shall resist physical manipulation and physical probing to the TSF
        by responding automatically such that the SFRs are always enforced. This all is realized by TSF_OS,
        in parts due to the characteristics of the hardware platform.
       FPT_TST.1.1 requires that the TSF shall run a suite of self-tests periodically during normal operation
        to demonstrate the correct operation of the TSF. This is realized by TSF_OS.
       FPT_TST.1.2 requires that the TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to verify the
        integrity of TSF data. This is realized by TSF_OS.
       FPT_TST.1.3 requires that the TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to verify the
        integrity of TSF. This is realized by TSF_OS.

7.2.1 Mapping of TOE Security Requirements and TOE Security Functionalities
Each TOE security functional requirement is implemented by at least one security functionality. The map-
ping of TOE Security Requirements and TOE Security Functionalities is given in the following table. If itera-
tions of a TOE security requirement are covered by the same TOE security functionality the mapping will
appear only once. The description of the TSF is given in section 7.1.

Glossary
The following glossary lists the main abbreviations and gives terms and definitions. It includes the terms
and definitions given in [PP0059], chapter 3.2.3 and 4.


Administrator              User who performs TOE initialisation, TOE personalisation, or other TOE admin-
                           istrative functions
Advanced electronic        Electronic signature which meets specific requirements in [Directive]. Ac-
signature                  cording to the Directive a electronic signature qualifies as an electronic sig-
                           nature if it:
                                   is uniquely linked to the signatory;
                                   is capable of identifying the signatory;
                                   is created using means that the signatory can maintain under his sole
                                    control, and
                                   is linked to the data to which it relates in such a manner that any
                                    subsequent change of the data is detectable.
Authentication data        Information used to verify the claimed identity of a user
Authentication             Authentication defines a procedure that verifies the identity of the commu-ni-
                           cation partner. The most elegant method is based on the use of so called elec-
                           tronic signatures.
CA                         Certification authority.
CC                         Common criteria.
Certificate                Electronic signature used as electronic attestation binding an SVD to a person
                           confirming the identity of that person as legitimate signer ([Directive]: 2.9).
Certificate info           Information associated with a SCD/SVD pair that may be stored in a secure sig-
                           nature creation device. Certificate info is either
                                   a signer's public key certificate or,
                                   one or more hash values of a signer's public key certificate together with
                                    an identifier of the hash function used to compute the hash values.
                           Certificate info may be combined with information to allow the user to distin-
                           guish between several certificates.
Certificate generation     Collection of application components that receive the SVD from the SSCD to
application (CGA)          generate a certificate obtaining data to be included in the certificate and to cre-
                           ate a electronic signature of the certificate
Certificate revocation     A list of revoked certificates issued by a certificate authority
list
Certification service      Entity that issues certificates or provides other services related to electronic sig-
provider (CSP)             natures ([Directive]: 2.11).
CGA                        Certification generation application.

Data to be signed or its Data received by a secure signature creation device as input in a single signa-
unique representation ture-creation operation. Note: DTBS/R is either
DTBS/R                       a hash-value of the data to be signed (DTBS), or
                                   an intermediate hash-value of a first part of the DTBS complemented
                                    with a remaining part of the DTBS, or
                                   the DTBS.
DTBS                       Data to be signed.
DTBS/R                     Data to be signed or its unique representation.
EAL                        Evaluation assurance level.
ECC                        (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) class of procedures providing an attractive alterna-
                           tive for the probably most popular asymmetric procedure, the RSA algorithm.
Hash function              A function which forms the fixed-size result (the hash value) from an arbitrary
                           amount of data (which is the input). These functions are used to generate the
                           electronic equivalent of a fingerprint. The significant factor is that it must be
                           impossible to generate two entries which lead to the same hash value (so called
                           collisions) or even to generate a matching message for a defined hash value.
Integrity                  The test on the integrity of data is carried out by checking messages for changes
                           during the transmission by the receiver. Common test procedures employ Hash-
                           functions, MACs (Message Authentication Codes) or – with additional function-
                           ality – electronic signatures.
IT                         Information technology.
Javacard                   A smart card with a Javacard operation system.
Legitimate user            User of a secure signature creation device who gains possession of it from an
                           SSCD-provisioning service provider and who can be authenticated by the SSCD
                           as its signatory.
MAC                        Message Authentication Code. Algorithm that expands the message by means
                           of a secret key by special redundant pieces of information, which are stored or
                           transmitted together with the message. To prevent an attacker from targeted
                           modification of the attached redundancy, requires its protection in a suitable
                           way.
Non-repudiation            One of the objectives in the employment of digital signatures. It describes the
                           fact that the sender of a message is prevented from denying the preparation of
                           the message. The problem cannot be simply solved with cryptographic routines,
                           but the entire environment needs to be considered and respective framework
                           conditions need to be provided by pertinent laws.
Notified body              Organizational entity designated by a member state of the European Union as
                           responsible for accreditation and algorithms and algorithm parameters ([Di-
                           rective]: 1.1b and 3.4).
PP                         Protection profile.
Private key                Secret key only known to the receiver of a message, which is used in asymmetric
                           ciphers for encryption or generation of electronic signatures.
Pseudo random num-         Many cryptographic mechanisms require random numbers (e.g. in key genera-
ber                        tion). The problem, however, is that it is difficult to implement true random
                           numbers in software. Therefore, so called pseudo-random number generators
                           are used, which then should be initialized with a real random element (the so
                           called seed).

Public key                 Publicly known key in an asymmetric cipher which is used for encryption and
                           verification of electronic signatures.

ture (PKI)                 cedures used to manage electronic certificates.

                           [Directive], Annex II.
Qualified electronic sig- advanced electronic signature that has been created with an SSCD with a key
nature                    certified with a qualified certificate ([Directive]: 5.1).
RAD                        Reference authentication data.
Random numbersa            Many cryptographic algorithms or protocols require a random element, mostly
                           in form of a random number, which is newly generated in each case. In these
                           cases, the security of the procedure depends in part on the suitability of these
                           random numbers. As the generation of real random numbers within computers
                           still imposes a problem (a source for real random events can in fact only be
                           gained by exact observation of physical events, which is not easy to realize for a
                           software), so called pseudo random numbers are used instead.

                                   obtain prior to the signature process a decision by the signatory,
                                   if the signatory indicates by specific unambiguous input or action its in-
                                    tent to sign send a DTBS/R to the TOE
                                   process the electronic signature generated by the SSCD as appropriate,

                           carry out its own calculations in contrast to a simple storage card. Sometimes a
                           smart card has a numerical coprocessor (NPU) to execute public key algorithms
                           efficiently. Smart cards have all of their functionality comprised on a single chip
                           (in contrast to chip cards, which contain several chips wired to each other).
                           Therefore, such a smart card is ideal for use in cryptography as it is almost im-
                           possible to manipulate its internal processes.
