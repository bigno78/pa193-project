                                         Figure 1 - TOE Overview


5      The ROM code holds the IC Dedicated Firmware belonging to the IC ST31G480
6      The Operating System Java Card Platform and the applet jePASS v.1.1.4 are located in
       the NVM.
7      During the Manufacturing phase the Java Card Package, including the applet jePASS
       v.1.1.4 are loaded on the TOE.
8      The applet jePASS v.1.1.4 is instantiated from this package during the initialisation of the
       TOE into the NVM memory area.
9      The applet jePASS v.1.1.4 utilises the IC ST31G480 RAM and the NVM area for storage
       of operational and permanent data, in order to provide security functionality.
10     During operational use phase the applet jePASS v.1.1.4 interacts with other external
       entities.
11     This composite ST is based on the ST of the underlying IC ST31G480 platform
       [ST_ST31G480]
12     Important note: The TOE is closed Java Card implementation with the applet jePASS
       v.1.1.4 and the applet IAS v.1.1.4 are installed and initialized as a single instances. The
       applet IAS v.1.1.4 isn’t in the scope of the TOE. The applet jePASS v.1.1.4 is default
       selected after TOE reset. No post-issuance of further applets is possible to install on the
       TOE. The applets are installed and initialized in Phase 2, step 3. of TOE life cycle (see
       chap. 7.3.4).


     7.3.3 TOE usage and security features for operational use
13     A State or Organization issues MRTDs to be used by the holder for international travel.
       The traveller presents a MRTD to the inspection system to prove his or her identity. The
       MRTD in context of this ST contains
            visual (eye readable) biographical data and portrait of the holder,


                                                                                   P a g e 17 | 80
                  a separate data summary (MRZ data) for visual and machine reading using OCR
                   methods in the Machine readable zone (MRZ) and
                  data elements on the TOE according to LDS for contactless machine reading. The
                   authentication of the traveller is based on
                         i. the possession of a valid MRTD personalized for a holder with the claimed
                            identity as given on the biographical data page and
                        ii. optional biometrics using the reference data stored in the MRTD.
    14     The issuing State or Organization ensures the authenticity of the data of genuine MRTD’s.
           The receiving State trusts a genuine MRTD of an issuing State or Organization.
    15     For this ST the MRTD is viewed as unit of:
                  the physical MRTD as travel document in form of paper, plastic and chip (TOE). It
                   presents visual readable data including (but not limited to) personal data of the
                   MRTD holder
                         i. the biographical data on the biographical data page of the MRTD,
                        ii. the printed data in the Machine-Readable Zone (MRZ) and
                       iii. the printed portrait.


                  the logical MRTD as data of the MRTD holder stored according to the Logical Data
                   Structure [ICAO_9303] as specified by ICAO on the contact based or contactless
                   integrated circuit. It presents contact based / contactless readable data including
                   (but not limited to) personal data of the MRTD holder
                         i. the digital Machine Readable Zone Data (digital MRZ data, EF.DG1),
                        ii. the digitized portraits (EF.DG2),
                       iii. the optional biometric reference data of finger(s) (EF.DG3) or iris image(s)
                            (EF.DG4) 1 or both
                       iv. the other data according to LDS (EF.DG5 to EF.DG16) and
                        v. the Document security object (SOD).

    16     The issuing State or Organization implements security features of the MRTD to maintain
           the authenticity and integrity of the MRTD and their data. The MRTD as the passport book
           and the MRTD’s chip (TOE) is uniquely identified by the Document Number.
    17     The physical MRTD is protected by physical security measures (e.g. watermark on paper,
           security printing), logical (e.g. authentication keys of the TOE) and organizational security
           measures (e.g. control of materials, personalization procedures) [ICAO_9303]. These
           security measures include the binding of the MRTD’s chip (TOE) to the passport book.
    18     The logical MRTD is protected in authenticity and integrity by a digital signature created by
           the document signer acting for the issuing State or Organization and the security features
           of the TOE.
    19     The ICAO defines the baseline security methods Passive Authentication and the optional
           advanced security methods Basic Access Control to the logical travel document, Active
           Authentication of the travel document’s chip, Extended Access Control to and the Data
           Encryption of sensitive biometrics as optional security measure in the [ICAO_9303], and
           Password Authenticated Connection Establishment [ICAO_TR]. The Passive
           Authentication Mechanism is performed completely and independently of the TOE by the
           TOE environment

1
         These biometric reference data are optional according to [ICAO_9303]. It is assumed that the issuing State or Organization
         uses this option and protects these data by means of EAC


                                                                                                            P a g e 18 | 80
20   The TOE protects the integrity of logical MRTD by write only-once access control and by
     physical means, and the confidentiality of logical MRTD by the Basic Access Control
     Mechanism and by Extended Access Control Mechanism.
21   The Basic Access Control is a security feature supported by the TOE. The inspection
     system
          reads optically the MRTD,
          authenticates itself as inspection system by means of Document Basic Access
           Keys. After successful authentication of the inspection system TOE provides read
           access to the logical MRTD by means of private communication (secure messaging)
           with this inspection system [ICAO_9303] normative appendix 5.
     Note: For what concern the Basic Access Control Mechanism and according to the
     assurance level EAL4 and augmentations stated in [PP-0055] this mechanism shall be
     evaluated considering only enhanced basic attack potential (i.e. AVA_VAN.3)


22   The TOE implements the Active Authentication as defined in[ICAO_9303]. Keys for Active
     Authentication can be loaded into the TOE. These operations take place at personalization
     time




                                                                           P a g e 19 | 80
         7.3.4 Life Cycle Phases
    23     The life cycle of a MRTD is described in [PP-0055] and it is split in four phases.
            Phase 1: “TOE Development”
            Phase 2: “TOE Manufacturing”
            Phase 3: “Personalization of the TOE MRTD application”
            Phase 4: “TOE Operational Use”

            In the beneath discussion, the following entities and roles are identified:
            MRTD Embedded Software Developer: STMicroelectronics srl, Marcianise (CE) Italy
            IC Developer: STMicroelectronics SAS, Rousset France
            MRTD IC Manufacturer: STMicroelectronics srl, Marcianise (CE) Italy
            MRTD Manufacturer: National accredited MRTD Manufacturing center (IPZS for Italy)
            MRTD Personalization Agent: Public administration or National accredited MRTD
            personalization center enabled to issue personalized MRTD booklet (IPZS for Italy).


Life cycle phase 1: “TOE Development ”.
     24  In this phase the TOE is developed.
    25     This phase includes the following Step 1:
                Development of TOE Embedded Software performed by MRTD Embedded Software
                 Developer:
                         o   Operating System Java Card Platform
                         o   TOE MRTD application as Java card Applet
                TOE IC Development performed by IC Developer:
                         o   IC ST31G480 with its Dedicated Software and embedded cryptographic
                             library
                TOE MRTD application guidance documentation
    26     In the Step 1 the MRTD Embedded Software Developer delivers the Embedded Software
           to the IC Developer. The Embedded Software is delivered in one of two possible
           configuration:
                Embedded Software not Pre-Personalized. No OS Java Card Platform or
                 application code is delivered to IC Developer. Only pre-perso info to be used in “Pre-
                 Personalization” process at MRTD IC Manufacturer premises are delivered. Pre-
                 Perso info includes reference to keys for securing the download of flash code (OS,
                 Java Card platform and application) on the IC ST31G480.
                Golden sample as full TOE image, as output of phase 2 step 3 anticipated here.


    27     Step 2: IC Developer loads on IC ST31G480 programmable memory the Embedded
           Software and alternatively do following :
                Embedded Software not Pre-Personalized. IC are securely delivered to the
                 MRTD IC Manufacturer. The TOE life cycle restart from phase 2 step 3.
                Golden sample as full TOE image. The IC and the respective guidance documents
                 are securely delivered to the MRTD manufacturer.
                 The TOE life cycle restart from phase 2 step 4.

                                                                                      P a g e 20 | 80
Life cycle phase 2: “TOE Manufacturing ”
     28  This phase is split in the following steps:
              Step 3: The MRTD IC manufacturer receives IC loaded with Dedicated Software
               and with the Embedded Software not pre-personalized with the IC ST31G480 flash
               code loader secured with the key established as pre-perso info is Phase 1 step 1
               and step2. MRTD IC manufacturer integrates applets jePASS v.1.1.4 and IAS
               v.1.1.4 with OS java card platform performing following steps:
                    i. loading the OS Java Card Platform into IC ST31G480 programmable
                       memory,
                   ii. loading and instantiation of all applets
                   iii. switch the OS Java Card Platform in a secured closed state.
                   iv. Dump the binary image of full components of TOE
               The IC with full TOE image is securely delivered to the MRTD manufacturer.
               The MRTD IC manufacturer delivers the guidance documentation to MRTD
               manufacturer.
              Step 4: The MRTD manufacturer combines the IC with hardware for the contactless
               interface in the passport booklet, equips MRTD’s chips with pre-personalization
               Data and eventually create the LDS structures as defined in [ICAO_9303].
              Step 5: The pre-personalized MRTD together with the IC Identifier is securely
               delivered from the MRTD manufacturer to the MRTD Personalization Agent. The
               MRTD manufacturer also provides the relevant parts of the guidance documentation
               to the MRTD Personalization Agent.

Life cycle phase 3: “Personalization of the TOE MRTD application”
     29  The personalization of the MRTD includes the following actions in the Step 6 performed
         by the MRTD Personalization Agent.:
              the survey of the MRTD holder’s biographical data,
              the enrolment of the MRTD holder biometric reference data (i.e. the digitized
               portraits and the optional biometric reference data),
              the printing of the visual readable data onto the physical MRTD,
              the writing of the TOE User Data and TSF Data into the logical MRTD. This step is
               performed by the Personalization Agent and includes but is not limited to creation of:
                    i. the digital MRZ data (EF.DG1),
                   ii. the digitized portrait (EF.DG2) and
                   iii. the Document security object
              Configuration of the TSF if necessary.
              The signing of the Document security object by the Document Signer [ICAO_9303]
               finalizes the personalization of the genuine MRTD for the MRTD holder.
              The personalized MRTD (together with appropriate guidance for TOE use if
               necessary) is handed over to the MRTD holder for operational use
    30   The TSF data (data created by and for the TOE, that might affect the operation of the
         TOE) comprise (but are not limited to) the Personalization Agent Authentication Key(s)
         and the Basic Authentication Control Key

Life cycle phase 4: “TOE Operational Use ”



                                                                                  P a g e 21 | 80
31    Step 7: The TOE is used as MRTD chip by the traveler and the inspection systems in the
      “TOE Operational Use” phase. The user data can be read according to the security policy
      of the issuing State or Organization and can be used according to the security policy of the
      issuing State but they can never be modified.
32    Application note: The authorized Personalization Agents might be allowed to add (not to
      modify) data in the other data groups of the MRTD application (e.g. person(s) to notify
      EF.DG16) in the Phase 4 “TOE Operational Use”. This will imply an update of the
      Document Security Object including the re-signing by the Document Signer.
33    Application note: The phases 1 and parts of phase 2 (Step 1, Step 2 and Step 3) are part
      of the TOE evaluation. The TOE delivery is after phase 2 Step 3. Since specific production
      steps of phase 2 are of minor security relevance (e. g. booklet manufacturing and antenna
      integration) these are not part of the CC evaluation under ALC. The issuing State or
      Organization is responsible for these specific production steps.

     7.3.5 Non-TOE hardware/software/firmware required by the TOE
34    The antenna and the applet IAS v.1.1.4 are not in the scope of the TOE.
35    There is no explicit non-TOE hardware, software or firmware required by the TOE to
      perform its claimed security features. The TOE is defined to comprise the chip and the
      complete operating system and application. Note, the inlay holding the chip as well as the
      antenna and the booklet (holding the printed MRZ) are needed to represent a complete
      MRTD, nevertheless these parts are not inevitable for the secure operation of the TOE.

9. SECURITY PROBLEM DEFINITION

9.1        Introduction
      47    Assets
            The assets to be protected by the TOE include the User Data stored in the TOE, user data
            transferred between the TOE and the terminal and MRTD tracing data
      48    Logical MRTD Data
            The logical MRTD data consists of the EF.COM, EF.DG1 to EF.DG16 (with different
            security needs) and the Document Security Object EF.SOD according to LDS
            [ICAO_9303]. These data are user data of the TOE. The EF.COM lists the existing
            elementary files (EF) with the user data. The EF.DG1 to EF.DG13 and EF.DG 16 contain
            personal data of the MRTD holder. The Chip Authentication Public Key (EF.DG 14) is
            used by the inspection system for the Chip Authentication. The EF.SOD is used by the
            inspection system for Passive Authentication of the logical MRTD.
            For interoperability reasons the ‘ICAO Doc 9303’ [ICAO_9303] requires that Basic
            Inspection Systems may have access to logical MRTD data:
             Logical MRTD standard User Data (i.e. Personal Data) of the MRTD holder (EF.DG1,
              EF.DG2, EF.DG5 to EF.DG13, EF.DG16),
             Chip Authentication Public Key in EF.DG14,
             Active Authentication Public Key in EF.DG15,
             Document Security Object (SOD) in EF.SOD,
             Common data in EF.COM.
            The TOE is not in certified mode, if it is accessed using BAC [ICAO_9303].
            As the BAC mechanism cannot resist attacks with high attack potential [PP-0055] the PACE is
            recommended to be used instead of BAC. If nevertheless BAC has to be used, it is recommended to
            perform Chip Authentication Protocol v.1 before getting access to data (except EF.DG14), as this
            mechanism is resistant to high potential attacks
            The TOE prevents read access to sensitive User Data
             Sensitive biometric reference data (EF.DG3, EF.DG4)
            A sensitive asset is the following more general one.
      49    Authenticity of the travel document’s chip
            The authenticity of the MRTD’s chip personalized by the issuing State or Organization for
            the MRTD holder is used by the traveler to prove his possession of a genuine MRTD.
            This Security Target includes the following primary assets:
             user data stored on the TOE
             user data transferred between the TOE and the terminal connected

9.2        Subjects and external entities
      50    This ST considers the following subjects:
      51    Manufacturer: The generic term for the IC Manufacturer producing the integrated circuit
            and the MRTD Manufacturer completing the IC to the MRTD’s chip. The Manufacturer is
            the default user of the TOE during the Phase 2 Manufacturing. The TOE does not
            distinguish between the users IC Manufacturer and MRTD Manufacturer using this role
            Manufacturer

                                                                                       P a g e 24 | 80
52   Personalization Agent: The agent is acting on behalf of the issuing State or Organization
     to personalize the MRTD for the holder by some or all of the following activities
      i. establishing the identity the holder for the biographic data in the MRTD
      ii. enrolling the biometric reference data of the MRTD holder i.e. the portrait, the
          encoded finger image(s) and/or the encoded iris image(s)
     iii. writing these data on the physical and logical MRTD for the holder as defined for
          global, international and national interoperability
     iv. writing the initial TSF data
      v. signing the Document Security Object defined in [ICAO_9303].

53   Terminal: A terminal is any technical system communicating with the TOE either through
     the contact interface or through the contactless interface.

54   Inspection system (IS): A technical system used by the border control officer of the
     receiving State (i) examining an MRTD presented by the traveller and verifying its
     authenticity and (ii) verifying the traveller as MRTD holder. The Basic Inspection System
     (BIS) (i) contains a terminal for the contactless communication with the MRTD’s chip, (ii)
     implements the terminals part of the Basic Access Control Mechanism and (iii) gets the
     authorization to read the logical MRTD under the Basic Access Control by optical reading
     the MRTD or other parts of the passport book providing this information. The General
     Inspection System (GIS) is a Basic Inspection System which implements additionally the
     Chip Authentication Mechanism. The Extended Inspection System (EIS) in addition to
     the General Inspection System (i) implements the Terminal Authentication Protocol and (ii)
     is authorized by the issuing State or Organization through the Document Verifier of the
     receiving State to read the sensitive biometric reference data. The security attributes of
     the EIS are defined of the Inspection System Certificates.

55   Application note: This ST does not distinguish between the BIS, GIS and EIS because
     the Extended Access Control is outside the scope.

56   MRTD Holder: The rightful holder of the MRTD for whom the issuing State or
     Organization personalized the MRTD.

57   Traveller: Person presenting the MRTD to the inspection system and claiming the identity
     of the MRTD holder.
58   Attacker: A threat agent trying
      i. to identify and to trace the movement of the MRTD’s chip remotely (i.e. without
         knowing or optically reading the printed MRZ data)
      ii. to read or to manipulate the logical MRTD without authorization
     iii. to read sensitive biometric reference data (i.e. EF.DG3, EF.DG4)
     iv. to forge a genuine MRTD
59   Application note: An impostor is attacking the inspection system as TOE IT environment
     independent on using a genuine, counterfeit or forged MRTD. Therefore the impostor may
     use results of successful attacks against the TOE but the attack itself is not relevant for
     the TOE.




                                                                             P a g e 25 | 80
9.3        Assumptions
      60    The assumptions describe the security aspects of the environment in which the TOE will
            be used or is intended to be used
      61    A.MRTD_Manufact                                 MRTD manufacturing on steps 4 to 6
            It is assumed that appropriate functionality testing of the MRTD is used. It is assumed that
            security procedures are used during all manufacturing and test operations to maintain
            confidentiality and integrity of the MRTD and of its manufacturing and test data (to prevent
            any possible copy, modification, retention, theft or unauthorized use).


      62    A.MRTD_Delivery                                     MRTD delivery during steps 4 to 6
            Procedures shall guarantee the control of the TOE delivery and storage process and
            conformance to its objectives:
                   Procedures shall ensure protection of TOE material/information under delivery and
                    storage.
                   Procedures shall ensure that corrective actions are taken in case of improper
                    operation in the delivery process and storage.
                   Procedures shall ensure that people dealing with the procedure for delivery have
                    got the required skill.


      63    A.Pers_Agent                                      Personalization of the MRTD’s chip
            The Personalization Agent ensures the correctness of (i) the logical MRTD with respect to
            the MRTD holder, (ii) the Document Basic Access Keys, (iii) the Chip Authentication Public
            Key(EF.DG14) if stored on the MRTD’s chip, and (iv) the Document Signer Public Key
            Certificate (if stored on the MRTD’s chip). The Personalization Agent signs the Document
            Security Object. The Personalization Agent bears the Personalization Agent
            Authentication to authenticate himself to the TOE by symmetric cryptographic
            mechanisms.


      64    A.Insp_Sys                            Inspection Systems for global interoperability
            The Inspection System is used by the border control officer of the receiving State (i)
            examining an MRTD presented by the traveler and verifying its authenticity and (ii)
            verifying the traveler as MRTD holder. The Basic Inspection System for global
            interoperability (i) includes the Country Signing Public Key and the Document Signer
            Public Key of each issuing State or Organization, and (ii) implements the terminal part of
            the Basic Access Control [ICAO_9303]. The Basic Inspection System reads the logical
            MRTD under Basic Access Control and performs the Passive Authentication to verify the
            logical MRTD.
            Application note: According to [ICAO_9303] the support of the Passive Authentication
            mechanism is mandatory whereas the the Basic Access Control is optional. This ST does
            not address Primary Inspection Systems therefore the BAC is mandatory.


      65    A.BAC-Keys                    Cryptographic quality of Basic Access Control Keys
            The Document Basic Access Control Keys being generated and imported by the issuing
            State or Organization have to provide sufficient cryptographic strength. As a consequence
            of the [ICAO_9303], the Document Basic Access Control Keys are derived from a defined
            subset of the individual printed MRZ data. It has to be ensured that these data provide
            sufficient entropy to withstand any attack based on the decision that the inspection system has to
            derive Document Access Keys from the printed MRZ data with enhanced basic attack potential.

                                                                                         P a g e 26 | 80
      66    Application note: When assessing the MRZ data resp. the BAC keys entropy potential
            dependencies between these data (especially single items of the MRZ) have to be
            considered and taken into account. E.g. there might be a direct dependency between the
            Document Number when chosen consecutively and the issuing date.


9.4        Threats
      67    This section describes the threats to be averted by the TOE independently or in
            collaboration with its IT environment. These threats result from the TOE method of use in
            the operational environment and the assets stored in or protected by the TOE.


      68    T.Chip_ID                                                Identification of MRTD’s chip
                    Adverse action: An attacker trying to trace the movement of the MRTD by
                     identifying remotely the MRTD’s chip by establishing or listening to
                     communications through the contactless communication interface.
                    Threat agent: having enhanced basic attack potential, not knowing the optically
                     readable MRZ data printed on the MRTD data page in advance
                    Asset: Anonymity of user


      69    T.Skimming                                                 Skimming the logical MRTD
                    Adverse action: An attacker imitates an inspection system trying to establish a
                     communication to read the logical MRTD or parts of it via the contactless
                     communication channel of the TOE.
                    Threat agent: having enhanced basic attack potential, not knowing the optically
                     readable MRZ data printed on the MRTD data page in advance
                    Asset: confidentiality of logical MRTD data
      70    T.Eavesdropping Eavesdropping             to the     communication       between     TOE    and
            inspection system
                    Adverse action: An attacker is listening to an existing communication between the
                     MRTD’s chip and an inspection system to gain the logical MRTD or parts of it. The
                     inspection system uses the MRZ data printed on the MRTD data page but the
                     attacker does not know these data in advance.
                    Threat agent: having enhanced basic attack potential, not knowing the optically
                     readable MRZ data printed on the MRTD data page in advance
                    Asset: confidentiality of logical MRTD data


      71    T.Forgery                                              Forgery of data on MRTD’s chip
                    Adverse action: An attacker alters fraudulently the complete stored logical MRTD
                     or any part of it including its security related data in order to deceive on an
                     inspection system by means of the changed MRTD holder’s identity or biometric
                     reference data. This threat comprises several attack scenarios of MRTD forgery.
                     The attacker may alter the biographical data on the biographical data page of the
                     passport book, in the printed MRZ and in the digital MRZ to claim another identity
                     of the traveller. The attacker may alter the printed portrait and the digitized portrait
                     to overcome the visual inspection of the inspection officer and the automated
                     biometric authentication mechanism by face recognition. The attacker may alter
                     the biometric reference data to defeat automated biometric authentication


                                                                                        P a g e 27 | 80
            mechanism of the inspection system. The attacker may combine data groups of
            different logical MRTDs to create a new forged MRTD, e.g. the attacker writes the
            digitized portrait and optional biometric reference finger data read from the logical
            MRTD of a traveller into another MRTD’s chip leaving their digital MRZ unchanged
            to claim the identity of the holder this MRTD. The attacker may also copy the
            complete unchanged logical MRTD to another contactless chip.
           Threat agent: having enhanced basic attack potential, being in possession of one
            or more legitimate MRTDs
           Asset: authenticity of logical MRTD data


72   T.Abuse-Func                                                 Abuse of Functionality
           Adverse action: An attacker may use functions of the TOE which shall not be
            used in the phase “Operational Use” in order (i) to manipulate User Data, (ii) to
            manipulate (explore, bypass, deactivate or change) security features or functions
            of the TOE or (iii) to disclose or to manipulate TSF Data. This threat addresses the
            misuse of the functions for the initialization and the personalization in the
            operational state after delivery to MRTD holder.
           Threat agent: having enhanced basic attack potential, being in possession of a
            legitimate MRTD
           Asset: confidentiality and authenticity of logical MRTD and TSF data, correctness
            of TSF


73   T.Information_Leakage                     Information Leakage from MRTD’s chip
           Adverse action: An attacker may exploit information which is leaked from the TOE
            during its usage in order to disclose confidential TSF data. The information leakage
            may be inherent in the normal operation or caused by the attacker. Leakage may
            occur through emanations, variations in power consumption, I/O characteristics,
            clock frequency, or by changes in processing time requirements. This leakage may
            be interpreted as a covert channel transmission but is more closely related to
            measurement of operating parameters, which may be derived either from
            measurements of the contactless interface (emanation) or direct measurements
            (by contact to the chip still available even for a contactless chip) and can then be
            related to the specific operation being performed. Examples are the Differential
            Electromagnetic Analysis (DEMA) and the Differential Power Analysis (DPA).
            Moreover, the attacker may try actively to enforce information leakage by fault
            injection (e.g. Differential Fault Analysis).
           Threat agent: having enhanced basic attack potential, being in possession of a
            legitimate MRTD
           Asset: confidentiality of logical MRTD and TSF data


74   T.Phys-Tamper                                                  Physical Tampering
           Adverse action: An attacker may perform physical probing of the MRTD’s chip in
            order (i) to disclose TSF Data or (ii) to disclose/reconstruct the MRTD’s chip
            Embedded Software. An attacker may physically modify the MRTD’s chip in order
            to (i) modify security features or functions of the MRTD’s chip, (ii) modify security
            functions of the MRTD’s chip Embedded Software, (iii) modify User Data or (iv) to
            modify TSF data. The physical tampering may be focused directly on the
            disclosure or manipulation of TOE User Data (e.g. the biometric reference data for
            the inspection system) or TSF Data (e.g. authentication key of the MRTD’s chip) or


                                                                             P a g e 28 | 80
                    indirectly by preparation of the TOE to following attack methods by modification of
                    security features (e.g. to enable information leakage through power analysis).
                    Physical tampering requires direct interaction with the MRTD’s chip internals.
                    Techniques commonly employed in IC failure analysis and IC reverse engineering
                    efforts may be used. Before that, the hardware security mechanisms and layout
                    characteristics need to be identified. Determination of software design including
                    treatment of User Data and TSF Data may also be a pre-requisite. The
                    modification may result in the deactivation of a security function. Changes of
                    circuitry or data can be permanent or temporary.
                   Threat agent: having enhanced basic attack potential, being in possession of a
                    legitimate MRTD
                   Asset: confidentiality and authenticity of logical MRTD and TSF data, correctness
                    of TSF


      75    T.Malfunction                             Malfunction due to Environmental Stress
                   Adverse action: An attacker may cause a malfunction of TSF or of the MRTD’s
                    chip Embedded Software by applying environmental stress in order to (i)
                    deactivate or modify security features or functions of the TOE or (ii) circumvent,
                    deactivate or modify security functions of the MRTD’s chip Embedded Software.
                    This may be achieved e.g. by operating the MRTD’s chip outside the normal
                    operating conditions, exploiting errors in the MRTD’s chip Embedded Software or
                    misusing administration function. To exploit these vulnerabilities an attacker needs
                    information about the functional operation.
                   Threat agent: having enhanced basic attack potential, being in possession of a
                    legitimate MRTD
                   Asset: confidentiality and authenticity of logical MRTD and TSF data, correctness
                    of TSF


9.5        Organizational Security Policies
      76    The TOE shall comply with the following Organizational Security Policies (OSP) as
            security rules, procedures, practices, or guidelines imposed by an organization upon its
            operations (see [CC_P1]).


      77    P.Manufact                                        Manufacturing of the MRTD’s chip
            The Initialization Data are written by the IC Manufacturer to identify the IC uniquely. The
            MRTD Manufacturer writes the Pre-personalization Data which contains at least the
            Personalization Agent Key.


      78    P.Personalization Personalization of the MRTD by issuing State or Organization
            only
            The issuing State or Organization guarantees the correctness of the biographical data, the
            printed portrait and the digitized portrait, the biometric reference data and other data of the
            logical MRTD with respect to the MRTD holder. The personalization of the MRTD for the

10. SECURITY OBJECTIVES
   82    This chapter describes the security objectives for the TOE and the security objectives for
         the TOE environment. The security objectives for the TOE environment are separated into
         security objectives for the development and production environment and security
         objectives for the operational environment.

10.1    Security Objectives for the TOE
   83    This section describes the security objectives for the TOE addressing the aspects of
         identified threats to be countered by the TOE and organizational security policies to be
         met by the TOE.


   84    OT.AC_Pers                   Access Control for Personalization of logical MRTD
         The TOE must ensure that the logical MRTD data in EF.DG1 to EF.DG16, the Document
         security object according to LDS [ICAO_9303] and the TSF data can be written by
         authorized Personalization Agents only. The logical MRTD data in EF.DG1 to EF.DG16
         and the TSF data may be written only during and cannot be changed after its
         personalization. The Document security object can be updated by authorized
         Personalization Agents if data in the data groups EF.DG 3 to EF.DG16 are added.
         Application note: The OT.AC_Pers implies that (1) the data of the LDS groups written
         during personalization for MRTD holder (at least EF.DG1 and EF.DG2) can not be
         changed by write access after personalization, (2) the Personalization Agents may (i) add
         (fill) data into the LDS data groups not written yet, and (ii) update and sign the Document
         Security Object accordingly. The support for adding data in the “Operational Use” phase is
         optional.


   85    OT.Data_Int                                              Integrity of personal data
         The TOE must ensure the integrity of the logical MRTD stored on the MRTD’s chip against
         physical manipulation and unauthorized writing. The TOE must ensure that the inspection
         system is able to detect any modification of the transmitted logical MRTD data.


   86    OT.Data_Conf                                      Confidentiality of personal data
         The TOE must ensure the confidentiality of the logical MRTD data groups EF.DG1 to
         EF.DG16. Read access to EF.DG1 to EF.DG16 is granted to terminals successfully
         authenticated as Personalization Agent. Read access to EF.DG1, EF.DG2 and EF.DG5 to
         EF.DG16 is granted to terminals successfully authenticated as Basic Inspection System.
         The Basic Inspection System shall authenticate itself by means of the Basic Access
         Control based on knowledge of the Document Basic Access Key.


         Application note: The traveler grants the authorization for reading the personal data in
         EF.DG1, EF.DG2 and EF.DG5 to EF.DG16 to the inspection system by presenting the
         MRTD. The MRTD’s chip shall provide read access to these data for terminals
         successfully authenticated by means of the Basic Access Control based on knowledge of
         the Document Basic Access Keys. The security objective OT.Data_Confidentiality requires
         the TOE to ensure the strength of the security function Basic Access Control
         Authentication. The Document Basic Access Keys are derived from the MRZ data defined
         by the TOE environment and are loaded into the TOE by the Personalization Agent.
         Therefore the sufficient quality of these keys has to result from the MRZ data’s entropy.
         Any attack based on decision of the ‘ICAO Doc 9303’ [ICAO_9303] that the inspection


                                                                                P a g e 31 | 80
     system derives Document Basic Access is ensured by OE.BAC-Keys. Note that the
     authorization for reading the biometric data in EF.DG3 and EF.DG4 is only granted after
     successful Enhanced Access Control. Thus the read access must be prevented even in
     case of a successful BAC Authentication.


87   OT.Identification                    Identification and Authentication of the TOE
     The TOE must provide means to store IC Identification and Pre-Personalization Data in its
     nonvolatile memory. The IC Identification Data must provide a unique identification of the
     IC during Phase 2 “Manufacturing” and Phase 3 “Personalization of the MRTD”. The
     storage of the Pre-Personalization data includes writing of the Personalization Agent
     Key(s). In Phase 4 “Operational Use” the TOE shall identify itself only to a successful
     authenticated Basic Inspection System or Personalization Agent.
     Application note: The TOE security objective OT.Identification addresses security
     features of the TOE to support the life cycle security in the manufacturing and
     personalization phases. The IC Identification Data are used for TOE identification in Phase
     2 “Manufacturing” and for traceability and/or to secure shipment of the TOE from Phase 2
     “Manufacturing” into the Phase 3 “Personalization of the MRTD”. The OT.Identification
     addresses security features of the TOE to be used by the TOE manufacturing. In the
     Phase 4 “Operational Use” the TOE is identified by the Document Number as part of the
     printed and digital MRZ. The OT.Identification forbids the output of any other IC (e.g.
     integrated circuit card serial number ICCSN) or MRTD identifier through the contactless
     interface before successful authentication as Basic Inspection System or as
     Personalization Agent.
88   The following TOE security objectives address the protection provided by the MRTD’s chip
     independent of the TOE environment.


89   OT.Prot_Abuse-Func                     Protection against Abuse of Functionality
     After delivery of the TOE to the MRTD Holder, the TOE must prevent the abuse of test
     and support functions that may be maliciously used to (i) disclose critical User Data, (ii)
     manipulate critical User Data of the IC Embedded Software, (iii) manipulate Soft-coded IC
     Embedded Software or (iv) bypass, deactivate, change or explore security features or
     functions of the TOE. Details of the relevant attack scenarios depend, for instance, on the
     capabilities of the Test Features provided by the IC Dedicated Test Software which are not
     specified here.


90   OT.Prot_Inf_Leak                          Protection against Information Leakage
     The TOE must provide protection against disclosure of confidential TSF data stored and/or
     processed in the MRTD’s chip:
           by measurement and analysis of the shape and amplitude of signals or the time
            between events found by measuring signals on the electromagnetic field, power
            consumption, clock, or I/O lines and
           by forcing a malfunction of the TOE and/or
           by a physical manipulation of the TOE.


     Application note: This objective pertains to measurements with subsequent complex
     signal processing due to normal operation of the TOE or operations enforced by an
     attacker. Details correspond to an analysis of attack scenarios which is not given here.




                                                                            P a g e 32 | 80
   91    OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper                         Protection against Physical Tampering
         The TOE must provide protection of the confidentiality and integrity of the User Data, the
         TSF Data, and the MRTD’s chip Embedded Software. This includes protection against
         attacks with enhanced-basic attack potential by means of:
                measuring through galvanic contacts which is direct physical probing on the chips
                 surface except on pads being bonded (using standard tools for measuring voltage
                 and current) or
                measuring not using galvanic contacts but other types of physical interaction
                 between charges (using tools used in solid-state physics research and IC failure
                 analysis)
                manipulation of the hardware and its security features, as well as
                controlled manipulation of memory contents (User Data, TSF Data)
         with a prior
                reverse engineering to understand the design and its properties and functions.


   92    OT.Prot_Malfunction                                 Protection against Malfunctions
         The TOE must ensure its correct operation. The TOE must prevent its operation outside
         the normal operating conditions where reliability and secure operation has not been
         proven or tested. This is to prevent errors. The environmental conditions may include
         external energy (esp. electromagnetic) fields, voltage (on any contacts), clock frequency,
         or temperature.
         Application note: A malfunction of the TOE may also be caused using a direct interaction
         with elements on the chip surface. This is considered as being a manipulation (refer to the
         objective OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper) provided that detailed knowledge about the TOE´s
         internals.


   93    OT.Active_Auth_MRTD_Proof            Proof of MRTD’s chip authenticity by Active
         Authentication
         The TOE shall support the Inspection Systems to verify the identity and authenticity of the
         MRTD’s chip as issued by the identified issuing State or Organization by means of the
         Active Authentication as defined in ‘ICAO Doc 9303’ [ICAO_9303].

10.2    Security Objectives for the Operational Environment

   96    Appropriate functionality testing of the TOE shall be used in step 4 to 6.
         During all manufacturing and test operations, security procedures shall be used through
         phases 4, 5 and 6 to maintain confidentiality and integrity of the TOE and its
         manufacturing and test data.




                                                                                      P a g e 33 | 80
97    OE.MRTD_Delivery                                   Protection of the MRTD delivery
      Procedures shall ensure protection of TOE material/information under delivery including
      the following objectives:
            non-disclosure of any security relevant information,
            identification of the element under delivery,
            meet confidentiality rules (confidentiality level, transmittal form, reception
             acknowledgment),
            physical protection to prevent external damage,
            secure storage and handling procedures (including rejected TOE’s),
            traceability of TOE during delivery including the following parameters:
                 o origin and shipment details,
                 o reception, reception acknowledgement,
                 o location material/information.


      Procedures shall ensure that corrective actions are taken in case of improper operation in
      the delivery process (including if applicable any non-conformance to the confidentiality
      convention) and highlight all non-conformance to this process. Procedures shall ensure
      that people (shipping department, carrier, reception department) dealing with the
      procedure for delivery have got the required skill, training and knowledge to meet the
      procedure requirements and be able to act fully in accordance with the above
      expectations.


98    OE.Personalization                                 Personalization of logical MRTD
      The issuing State or Organization must ensure that the Personalization Agents acting on
      behalf of the issuing State or Organization (i) establish the correct identity of the holder
      and create biographical data for the MRTD, (ii) enroll the biometric reference data of the
      MRTD holder i.e. the portrait, the encoded finger image(s) and/or the encoded iris
      image(s) and (iii) personalize the MRTD for the holder together with the defined physical
      and logical security measures to protect the confidentiality and integrity of these data.


99    OE.Pass_Auth_Sign                    Authentication of logical MRTD by Signature
      The issuing State or Organization must (i) generate a cryptographic secure Country
      Signing CA Key Pair, (ii) ensure the secrecy of the Country Signing CA Private Key and
      sign Document Signer Certificates in a secure operational environment, and (iii) distribute
      the Certificate of the Country Signing CA Public Key to receiving States and Organizations
      maintaining its authenticity and integrity. The issuing State or Organization must (i)
      generate a cryptographic secure Document Signer Key Pair and ensure the secrecy of the
      Document Signer Private Keys, (ii) sign Document Security Objects of genuine MRTD in a
      secure operational environment only and (iii) distribute the Certificate of the Document
      Signer Public Key to receiving States and Organizations. The digital signature in the
      Document Security Object relates all data in the data in EF.DG1 to EF.DG16 if stored in
      the LDS according to [ICAO_9303].


100   OE.BAC-Keys                  Cryptographic quality of Basic Access Control Keys
      The Document Basic Access Control Keys being generated and imported by the issuing
      State or Organization have to provide sufficient cryptographic strength. As a consequence
      of the ‘ICAO Doc 9303’ [ICAO_9303] the Document Basic Access Control Keys are

                                                                              P a g e 34 | 80
      derived from a defined subset of the individual printed MRZ data. It has to be ensured that
      these data provide sufficient entropy to withstand any attack based on the decision that
      the inspection system has to derive Document Basic Access Keys from the printed MRZ
      data with enhanced basic attack potential.


101   OE.Active_Auth_Sign          Active Authentication of logical MRTD by Signature
      The issuing State or Organization has to establish the necessary public key infrastructure
      in order to (i) generate the MRTD’s Active Authentication Key Pair, (ii) ensure the secrecy
      of the MRTD’s Active Authentication Private Key, sign and store the Active Authentication
      Public Key in the Active Authentication Public Key data in EF.DG15 and (iii) support
      inspection systems of receiving States or organizations to verify the authenticity of the
      MRTD’s chip used for genuine MRTD by certification of the Active Authentication Public
      Key by means of the Document Security Object.




      Receiving State or Organization
      The receiving State or Organization will implement the following security objectives of the
      TOE environment.


102   OE.Exam_MRTD                                 Examination of the MRTD passport book
      The inspection system of the receiving State or Organization must examine the MRTD
      presented by the traveler to verify its authenticity by means of the physical security
      measures and to detect any manipulation of the physical MRTD. The Basic Inspection
      System for global interoperability (i) includes the Country Signing Public Key and the
      Document Signer Public Key of each issuing State or Organization, and (ii) implements
      the terminal part of the Basic Access Control.


103   OE.Passive_Auth_Verif                      Verification by Passive Authentication
      The border control officer of the receiving State uses the inspection system to verify the
      traveler as MRTD holder. The inspection systems must have successfully verified the
      signature of Document Security Objects and the integrity data elements of the logical
      MRTD before they are used. The receiving States and Organizations must manage the
      Country Signing Public Key and the Document Signer Public Key maintaining their
      authenticity and availability in all inspection systems.


104   OE.Prot_Logical_MRTD                    Protection of data from the logical MRTD
      The inspection system of the receiving State or Organization ensures the confidentiality
      and integrity of the data read from the logical MRTD. The receiving State examining the
      logical MRTD being under Basic Access Control will use inspection systems which
      implement the terminal part of the Basic Access Control and use the secure messaging
      with fresh generated keys for the protection of the transmitted data (i.e. Basic Inspection
      Systems)


105   OE.Active_Auth_Verif                         Verification by Active Authentication
      The inspection systems to check the MRTD authenticity may use the active authentication
      verification, this is a stronger mechanism to guaranty the authenticity of the MRTD.



                                                                             P a g e 35 | 80

   107       The OSP P.Manufact “Manufacturing of the MRTD’s chip” requires a unique identification
             of the IC by means of the Initialization Data and the writing of the Pre-personalization Data
             as being fulfilled by OT.Identification.
   108       The OSP P.Personalization “Personalization of the MRTD by issuing State or Organization
             only” addresses the (i) the enrolment of the logical MRTD by the Personalization Agent as
             described in the security objective for the TOE environment OE.Personalization
             “Personalization of logical MRTD”, and (ii) the access control for the user data and TSF
             data as described by the security objective OT.AC_Pers “Access Control for
             Personalization of logical MRTD”. Note the manufacturer equips the TOE with the
             Personalization Agent Key(s) according to OT.Identification “Identification and
             Authentication of the TOE”. The security objective OT.AC_Pers limits the management of
             TSF data and management of TSF to the Personalization Agent.
   109       The OSP P.Personal_Data “Personal data protection policy” requires the TOE (i) to support
             the protection of the confidentiality of the logical MRTD by means of the Basic Access
             Control and (ii) enforce the access control for reading as decided by the issuing State or
             Organization. This policy is implemented by the security objectives OT.Data_Int “Integrity
             of personal data” describing the unconditional protection of the integrity of the stored data
             and during transmission. The security objective OT.Data_Confidentality “Confidentiality of
             personal data” describes the protection of the confidentiality.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               P a g e 36 | 80
110   The OSP P.Active_Auth “Active Authentication” addresses the active authentication
      protocol as described in [ICAO_9303]. The TOE environment will detect partly forged
      logical MRTD data by means of digital signature which will be created according to
      OE.Active_Auth_Sign “Active Authentication of logical MRTD by Signature” and verified
      by the inspection system according to OE.Active_Auth_Verif “Verification by Active
      Authentication”. This is possible only because genuine TOE enforce Active Authentication
      as specified in OT.Active_Auth_Proof.
111   The threat T.Chip_ID “Identification of MRTD’s chip” addresses the trace of the MRTD
      movement by identifying remotely the MRTD’s chip through the contactless
      communication interface. This threat is countered as described by the security objective
      OT.Identification by Basic Access Control using sufficiently strong derived keys as
      required by the security objective for the environment OE.BAC-Keys.
112   The threat T.Skimming “Skimming digital MRZ data or the digital portrait” and
      T.Eavesdropping “Eavesdropping to the communication between TOE and inspection
      system” address the reading of the logical MRTD trough the contactless interface or
      listening the communication between the MRTD’s chip and a terminal. This threat is
      countered by the security objective OT.Data_Conf “Confidentiality of personal data”
      through Basic Access Control using sufficiently strong derived keys as required by the
      security objective for the environment OE.BAC-Keys
113   The threat T.Forgery “Forgery of data on MRTD’s chip” addresses the fraudulent alteration
      of the complete stored logical MRTD or any part of it. The security objective OT.AC_Pers
      “Access Control for Personalization of logical MRTD“ requires the TOE to limit the write
      access for the logical MRTD to the trustworthy Personalization Agent (cf.
      OE.Personalization). The TOE will protect the integrity of the stored logical MRTD
      according the security objective OT.Data_Int “Integrity of personal data” and
      OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper “Protection against Physical Tampering”. The examination of the
      presented MRTD passport book according to OE.Exam_MRTD “Examination of the MRTD
      passport book” shall ensure that passport book does not contain a sensitive contactless
      chip which may present the complete unchanged logical MRTD. The TOE environment will
      detect partly forged logical MRTD data by means of digital signature which will be created
      according to OE.Pass_Auth_Sign “Authentication of logical MRTD by Signature” and
      verified by the inspection system according to OE.Passive_Auth_Verif “Verification by
      Passive Authentication”.
114   The threat T.Abuse-Func “Abuse of Functionality” addresses attacks using the MRTD’s
      chip as production material for the MRTD and misuse of the functions for personalization
      in the operational state after delivery to MRTD holder to disclose or to manipulate the
      logical MRTD. This threat is countered by OT.Prot_Abuse-Func “Protection against Abuse
      of Functionality”. Additionally this objective is supported by the security objective for the
      TOE environment: OE.Personalization “Personalization of logical MRTD” ensuring that the
      TOE security functions for the initialization and the personalization are disabled and the
      security functions for the operational state after delivery to MRTD holder are enabled
      according to the intended use of the TOE.
115   The threats T.Information_Leakage “Information Leakage from MRTD’s chip”, T.Phys-
      Tamper “Physical Tampering” and T.Malfunction “Malfunction due to Environmental
      Stress” are typical for integrated circuits like smart cards under direct attack with high
      attack potential. The protection of the TOE against these threats is addressed by the

11. EXTENDED COMPONENTS DEFINITION

   122   This Security Target uses components defined as extensions in [CC_P2]. All these
         extended components are drawn from [PP-0055]. The extended components FAU_SAS,
         FCS_RND, FMT_LIM and FPT_EMSEC are defined below.



11.1   Definition of the Family FAU_SAS Audit Data Storage
   123   To define the security functional requirements of the TOE a sensitive family (FAU_SAS) of
         the Class FAU (Security Audit) is defined here. This family describes the functional
         requirements for the storage of audit data. It has a more general approach than
         FAU_GEN, because it does not necessarily require the data to be generated by the TOE
         itself and because it does not give specific details of the content of the audit records.
   124   The family “Audit data storage (FAU_SAS)” is specified as follows.
         FAU_SAS Audit data storage

         capability to store [assignment: list of audit information] in the audit records.




                                                                                  P a g e 39 | 80
11.2   Definition of the Family FCS_RND Generation of random numbers
   125    To define the IT security functional requirements of the TOE a sensitive family
          (FCS_RND) of the Class FCS (cryptographic support) is defined here. This family
          describes the functional requirements for random number generation used for
          cryptographic purposes. The component FCS_RND is not limited to generation of
          cryptographic keys unlike the component FCS_CKM.1. The similar component FIA_SOS.2
          is intended for non-cryptographic use.
   126    The family “Generation of random numbers (FCS_RND)” is specified as follows.

       FCS_RND Generation of random numbers

       Family behaviour:
       This family defines quality requirements for the generation of random numbers which are
       intended to be used for cryptographic purposes.

       Component leveling:

                           FCS_RND Generation of random numbers          1



       FCS_RND.1      Generation of random numbers requires that the random number generator
                      implements defined security capabilities and that the random numbers meet
                      a defined quality metric.

       Management:     FCS_RND.1
                      There are no management activities foreseen.

       Audit:          FCS_RND.1

       Dependencies: No dependencies.

       FCS_RND.1.1 The TSF shall provide a mechanism to generate random numbers that meet
                   [assignment: a defined quality metric].




                                                                                P a g e 40 | 80
11.3   Definition of the Family FMT_LIM Limited capabilities and availability
   127    The family FMT_LIM describes the functional requirements for the Test Features of the
          TOE. The new functional requirements were defined in the class FMT because this class
          addresses the management of functions of the TSF. The examples of the technical
          mechanism used in the TOE show that no other class is appropriate to address the
          specific issues of preventing the abuse of functions by limiting the capabilities of the
          functions and by limiting their availability.
   128    The family “Limited capabilities and availability (FMT_LIM)” is specified as follows.


       FMT_LIM Limited capabilities and availability


       Family behaviour:
       This family defines requirements that limit the capabilities and availability of functions in a
       combined manner. Note, that FDP_ACF restricts the access to functions whereas the Limited
       capability of this family requires the functions themselves to be designed in a specific
       manner.


       Component leveling:
                                                                                1

                      FMT_LIM Limited capabilities and availability
                                                                                2


       FMT_LIM.1       Limited capabilities require that the TSF is built to provide only the
                       capabilities (perform action, gather information) which are necessary for its
                       genuine purpose.

       FMT_LIM.2       Limited availability requires that the TSF restrict the use of functions (refer to
                       Limited capabilities (FMT_LIM.1)). This can be achieved, for instance, by
                       removing or by disabling functions in a specific phase of the TOE’s lifecycle.


       Management:     FMT_LIM.1, FMT_LIM.2
                       There are no management activities foreseen.


       Audit:          FMT_LIM.1, FMT_LIM.2
                       There are no actions defined to be auditable.

   129    To define the IT security functional requirements of the TOE a sensitive family (FMT_LIM)
          of the Class FMT (Security Management) is defined here. This family describes the
          functional requirements for the Test Features of the TOE. The new functional
          requirements were defined in the class FMT because this class addresses the
          management of functions of the TSF. The examples of the technical mechanism used in
          the TOE show that no other class is appropriate to address the specific issues of
          preventing the abuse of functions by limiting the capabilities of the functions and by
          limiting their availability.



                                                                                     P a g e 41 | 80
   130   The TOE Functional Requirement “Limited capabilities (FMT_LIM.1)” is specified as
         follows.


     FMT_LIM.1 Limited capabilities

     Hierarchical to: No other components.

     Dependencies: FMT_LIM.2 Limited availability.

     FMT_LIM.1.1      The TSF shall be designed in a manner that limits their capabilities so that in
                      conjunction with “Limited availability (FMT_LIM.2)” the following policy is
                      enforced [assignment: Limited capability and availability policy].

   131   The TOE Functional Requirement “Limited availability (FMT_LIM.2)” is specified as
         follows.


     FMT_LIM.2 Limited availability

     Hierarchical to: No other components.

     Dependencies: FMT_LIM.1 Limited capabilities.



     FMT_LIM.2.1      The TSF shall be designed in a manner that limits their availability so that in
                      conjunction with “Limited capabilities (FMT_LIM.1)” the following policy is
                      enforced [assignment: Limited capability and availability policy].

Application Note:

     The functional requirements FMT_LIM.1 and FMT_LIM.2 assume that there are two types of
     mechanisms (limited capabilities and limited availability) which together shall provide
     protection in order to enforce the policy. This also allows that

         1. the TSF is provided without restrictions in the product in its user environment but its
            capabilities are so limited that the policy is enforced,

     or conversely,

         2. the TSF is designed with test and support functionality that is removed from, or
            disabled in, the product prior to the Operational Use Phase.

     The combination of both requirements shall enforce the policy.




                                                                                  P a g e 42 | 80
11.4   Definition of the Family FPT_EMSEC TOE Emanation
   132    The sensitive family FPT_EMSEC (TOE Emanation) of the Class FPT (Protection of the
          TSF) is defined here to describe the IT security functional requirements of the TOE. The
          TOE shall prevent attacks against the TOE and other secret data where the attack is
          based on external observable physical phenomena of the TOE. Examples of such attacks
          are evaluation of TOE’s electromagnetic radiation, simple power analysis (SPA),
          differential power analysis (DPA), timing attacks, etc. This family describes the functional
          requirements for the limitation of intelligible emanations which are not directly addressed
          by any other component of [CC_P2].
   133    The family “TOE Emanation (FPT_EMSEC)” is specified as follows.

       Family behaviour:
       This family defines requirements to mitigate intelligible emanations.


       Component leveling:

       FPT_EMSEC.1 TOE emanation has two constituents:


       FPT_EMSEC.1.1 Limit of Emissions requires to not emit intelligible emissions enabling
       access to TSF data or user data.

       FPT_EMSEC.1.2 Interface Emanation requires to not emit interface emanation enabling
       access to TSF data or user data.

       Management:     FPT_EMSEC.1

       Hierarchical to: No other components.

       Dependencies: No dependencies.

       FPT_EMSEC.1.1 The TOE shall not emit [assignment: types of emissions] in excess of
                     [assignment: specified limits] enabling access to [assignment: list of types
                     of TSF data] and [assignment: list of types of user data].
       FPT_EMSEC.1.2 The TSF shall ensure [assignment: type of users] are unable to use the
                     following interface [assignment: type of connection] to gain access to
                     [assignment: list of types of TSF data] and [assignment: list of types of
                     user data].

12. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

12.1    Overview
   134     This part of the PP defines the detailed security requirements that shall be satisfied by the
           TOE. The statement of TOE security requirements shall define the functional and
           assurance security requirements that the TOE needs to satisfy in order to meet the
           security objectives for the TOE.
   135     The CC allows several operations to be performed on functional requirements; refinement,
           selection, assignment, and iteration are defined in section 8.1 of Part 1 of the Common
           Criteria [CC_P1]Each of these operations is used in this ST.
   136     The refinement operation is used to add detail to a requirement, and thus further restricts
           a requirement. Refinements of security requirements are denoted in such a way that
           added words are in bold text and removed are crossed out.
   137     The selection operation is used to select one or more options provided by the CC in
           stating a requirement. Selections having been made by the PP author are denoted as
           underlined text. Selections made by the ST author appear slanted and underlined.
   138     The assignment operation is used to assign a specific value to an unspecified parameter,
           such as the length of a password. Assignments having been made by the PP author are
           denoted by showing as underlined text. Assignments made by the ST author appear
           slanted and underlined.
   139     The iteration operation is used when a component is repeated with varying operations.
           Iteration is denoted by showing a slash “/”, and the iteration indicator after the component
           identifier.
   140     This part defines the detailed security requirements that are satisfied by the TOE. These
           requirements comprise functional components from [CC_P2]
   141     Extended components as defined in Chapter 11, and the assurance components as
           defined for the Evaluation Assurance Level EAL4 from [CC_P3] augmented by
           ALC_DVS.2
   142     The definition of the subjects “Manufacturer”, “Personalization Agent”, “Basic Inspection
           System” and “Terminal” used in the following chapter is given in section 9. Note, that all
           these subjects are acting for homonymous external entities. The operations “write”, “read”,
           “modify”, and “disable read access” are used in accordance with the general linguistic
           usage. The operations “transmit”, “receive” and “authenticate” are originally taken from
           [CC_P2].

   145     This section on security functional requirements for the TOE is split into sub-section
           following the main security functionality.

12.2    Class FAU Security Audit
   146     The TOE shall meet the requirement “Audit storage (FAU_SAS.1)” as specified below
           (Common Criteria Part 2 extended).




                                                                                          P a g e 45 | 80
    FAU_SAS.1 Audit storage
       Hierarchical to: No other components.

       Dependencies: No dependencies.

                          Identification Data3 in the audit records.

    147    Application note: The Manufacturer role is the default user identity assumed by the TOE
           in the Phase 2 Manufacturing. The IC manufacturer and the MRTD manufacturer in the
           Manufacturer role write the Initialization Data and/or Pre-personalization Data as TSF
           Data of the TOE. The audit records are write-only-once data of the MRTD’s chip (see
           FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS).

    148    The TOE shall meet the requirement “Cryptographic key generation (FCS_CKM.1)” as
           specified below (Common Criteria Part 2). The iterations are caused by different
           cryptographic key generation algorithms to be implemented and key to be generated by
           the TOE.

           parameters to generate the Triple-DES key and the Retail-MAC message authentication
           keys for secure messaging by the algorithm in [ICAO_9303], Normative appendix A5.1.
           The algorithm uses the random number RND.ICC generated by TSF as required by
           FCS_RND.1.
    150    The TOE shall meet the requirement “Cryptographic key destruction (FCS_CKM.4)” as
           specified below ([CC_P2]).

     157    The TOE shall meet the requirement “Quality metric for random numbers (FCS_RND.1)”
            as specified below ([CC_P2]).


     FCS_RND.1 Quality metric for random numbers
           Hierarchical to:          No other components.

           Dependencies:             No dependencies.

           FCS_RND.1.1               The TSF shall provide a mechanism to generate random numbers
                                     that meet DRG.3 capabilities defined in [AIS31/20] standard29.

     158    Application note: The TOE implements a deterministic random number generator. When
            initialized with a random seed using a PTRNG of class PTG.2 as random source, the
            internal state of the RNG has at least 100 bits of min-entropy. The TOE’s RNG is
            initialized with a random seed at each TOE startup/reset/power-up. It generates output, for
            which 234 strings of bit length 128 are mutually different with probability greater than 1-2-16.
            The TOE’s RNG provides forward secrecy. It provides backward secrecy even if the
            current internal state is known. Statistical test suites cannot practically distinguish the
            TOE’s RNG sequences from output sequences of an ideal RNG. The TOE’s RNG pass
            test procedure A and the NIST statistical test suite [SP800-22].

     161    The TOE shall meet the requirement “Timing of identification (FIA_UID.1)” as specified
            below ([CC_P2]).


     FIA_UID.1 Timing of identification
           Hierarchical to:         No other components.

           Dependencies:            No dependencies.

           FIA_UID.1.1      The TSF shall allow
                            1. to read the Initialization Data in Phase 2 “Manufacturing”,
                            2. to read the random identifier in Phase 3 “Personalization of the MRTD”,
                            3. to read the random identifier in Phase 4 “Operational Use”30 on behalf of
                            the user to be performed before the user is identified.

           FIA_UID.1.2      The TSF shall require each user to be successfully identified before allowing
                            any other TSF-mediated actions on behalf of that user.

     162    Application note: The IC manufacturer and the MRTD manufacturer write the
            Initialization Data and/or Pre-personalization Data in the audit records of the IC during the
            Phase 2 “TOE Manufacturing”. The audit records can be written only in the Phase 2
            Manufacturing of the TOE. At this time the Manufacturer is the only user role available for
            the TOE. The MRTD manufacturer may create the user role Personalization Agent for
            transition from Phase 2 to Phase 3 “Personalization of the MRTD”. The users in role
            Personalization Agent identify themselves by means of selecting the authentication key.
            After personalization in the Phase 3 (i.e. writing the digital MRZ and the Document Basic
            Access Keys) the user role Basic Inspection System is created by writing the Document
            Basic Access Keys. The Basic Inspection System is identified as default user after power
            up or reset of the TOE i.e. the TOE will use the Document Basic Access Key to
            authenticate the user as Basic Inspection System.

     163    Application note: In the “TOE Operational Use” phase the MRTD must not allow anybody
            to read the ICCSN, the MRTD identifier or any other unique identification before the user
            is authenticated as Basic Inspection System (cf. T.Chip_ID). Note that the terminal and the
            MRTD’s chip use a (randomly chosen) identifier for the communication channel to allow
            the terminal to communicate with more then one RFID. If this identifier is randomly
            selected it will not violate the OT.Identification. If this identifier is fixed the ST writer should
            consider the possibility to misuse this identifier to perform attacks addressed by
            T.Chip_ID.
     164    The TOE shall meet the requirement “Timing of authentication (FIA_UAU.1)” as specified
            below ([CC_P2]).

           FIA_UAU.1.1 The TSF shall allow
                       1. to read the Initialization Data in Phase 2 “Manufacturing”,
                       2. to read the random identifier in Phase 3 “Personalization of the MRTD”,

                       on behalf of the user to be performed before the user is authenticated.

           FIA_UAU.1.2 The TSF shall require each user to be successfully authenticated before
                       allowing any other TSF-mediated actions on behalf of that user.

     165    Application note: The Basic Inspection System and the Personalization Agent
            authenticate themselves.
     166    The TOE shall meet the requirements of “Single-use authentication mechanisms
            (FIA_UAU.4)” as specified below ([CC_P2]).


     FIA_UAU.4 Single-use authentication mechanisms - Single-use authentication of the
         Terminal by the TOE
           Hierarchical to:         No other components.

           Dependencies:            No dependencies.

           FIA_UAU.4.1 The TSF shall prevent reuse of authentication data related to
                       1. Basic Access Control Authentication Mechanism,
                       2. Authentication Mechanism based on AES32.

     167    Application note: The authentication mechanisms may use either a challenge freshly and
            randomly generated by the TOE to prevent reuse of a response generated by a terminal in
            a successful authentication attempt. However, the authentication of Personalisation Agent
            may rely on other mechanisms ensuring protection against replay attacks, such as the use
            of an internal counter as a diversifier.
     168    Application note: The Basic Access Control Mechanism is a mutual device
            authentication mechanism defined in [ICAO_9303]. In the first step the terminal
            authenticates itself to the MRTD’s chip and the MRTD’s chip authenticates to the terminal
            in the second step. In this second step the MRTD’s chip provides the terminal with a

                                                                                          P a g e 51 | 80
            challenge-response-pair which allows a unique identification of the MRTD’s chip with
            some probability depending on the entropy of the Document Basic Access Keys.
            Therefore the TOE shall stop further communications if the terminal is not successfully
            authenticated in the first step of the protocol to fulfill the security objective OT.Identification
            and to prevent T.Chip_ID.
     169    The TOE shall meet the requirement “Multiple authentication mechanisms (FIA_UAU.5)”
            as specified below ([CC_P2]).


     FIA_UAU.5 Multiple authentication mechanisms
           Hierarchical to:       No other components.

           Dependencies:          No dependencies.

           FIA_UAU.5.1 The TSF shall provide
                       1. Basic Access Control Authentication Mechanism
                       2. Symmetric Authentication Mechanism based on AES33
                       to support user authentication.

           FIA_UAU.5.2 The TSF shall authenticate any user’s claimed identity according to the
                       following rules:
                       1. the TOE accepts the authentication attempt as Personalization Agent by
                       one of the following mechanism(s) the Symmetric Authentication Mechanism
                       with the Personalization Agent Key34,
                       2. the TOE accepts the authentication attempt as Basic Inspection System
                       only by means of the Basic Access Control Authentication Mechanism with
                       the Document Basic Access Keys35.

     170    Application note: The Basic Access Control Mechanism includes the secure messaging
            for all commands exchanged after successful authentication of the inspection system. The
            Personalization Agent may use Symmetric Authentication Mechanism without secure
            messaging mechanism as well if the personalization environment prevents eavesdropping
            to the communication between TOE and personalization terminal. The Basic Inspection
            System may use the Basic Access Control Authentication Mechanism with the Document
            Basic Access Keys.
     171    The TOE shall meet the requirement “Re-authenticating (FIA_UAU.6)” as specified below
            ([CC_P2]).

                             Authentication Mechanism36.

     172    Application note: The Basic Access Control Mechanism specified in [ICAO_9303]
            includes the secure messaging for all commands exchanged after successful
            authentication of the Inspection System. The TOE checks by secure messaging in
            MAC_ENC mode each command based on Retail-MAC whether it was sent by the
            successfully authenticated terminal (see FCS_COP.1/MAC for further details). The TOE
            does not execute any command with incorrect message authentication code. Therefore
            the TOE re-authenticates the user for each received command and accepts only those
            commands received from the previously authenticated BAC user.
     173    Application note: Note that in case the TOE should also fulfill [PP-0056] the BAC
            communication might be followed by a Chip Authentication mechanism establishing a new
            secure messaging that is distinct from the BAC based communication. In this case the
            condition in FIA_UAU.6 above should not contradict to the option that commands are sent
            to the TOE that are no longer meeting the BAC communication but are protected by a
            more secure communication channel established after a more advanced authentication
            process.
     174    The TOE shall meet the requirement “Authentication failure handling (FIA_AFL.1)” as
            specified below ([CC_P2]).


     FIA_AFL.1 Authentication failure handling
           Hierarchical to: No other components.

           Dependencies: FIA_UAU.1 Timing of authentication

           FIA_AFL.1.1                The TSF shall detect when an positive integer equal to 1 37 of
                                      unsuccessful authentication attempts occur related to the
                                      Personalization Agent authentication and the Basic Inspection
                                      System authentication38.

           FIA_AFL.1.2                When the defined number of unsuccessful authentication attempts
                                      has been met39, the TSF shall wait for an administrator configurable
                                      time between the receiving the terminal challenge and sending the
                                      TSF response during the BAC authentication attempts40.

     175    Application note: In this ST the open operations in the SFR FIA_AFL.1.1 and
            FIA_AFL.1.2 have been assigned to ensure the strength of authentication function as
            terminal part of the Basic Access Control Authentication Protocol to resist enhanced basic

     188    The TOE shall meet the requirement “Limited availability (FMT_LIM.2)” as specified below
            ([CC_P2]).


     FMT_LIM.2 Limited availability
           Hierarchical to:           No other components.

           Dependencies:              FMT_LIM.1 Limited capabilities.

           FMT_LIM.2.1                The TSF shall be designed in a manner that limits their availability so that in
                                      conjunction with “Limited capabilities (FMT_LIM.1)” the following policy is
                                      enforced:
                                      Deploying Test Features after TOE Delivery does not allow
                                      1. User Data to be disclosed or manipulated,
                                      2. TSF data to be disclosed or manipulated

                                      may enable other attacks.

     189    Application note: The formulation of “Deploying Test Features …” in FMT_LIM.2.1 might
            be a little bit misleading since the addressed features are no longer available (e.g. by
            disabling or removing the respective functionality). Nevertheless the combination of
            FMT_LIM.1 and FMT_LIM.2 is introduced provide an optional approach to enforce the
            same policy. Note that the term “software” in item 3 of FMT_LIM.1.1 and FMT_LIM.2.1
            refers to both IC Dedicated and IC Embedded Software.
     190    Application note: The following SFR are iterations of the component Management of
            TSF data (FMT_MTD.1). The TSF data include but are not limited to those identified
            below.
     191    The TOE shall meet the requirement “Management of TSF data (FMT_MTD.1)” as
            specified below ([CC_P2]). The iterations address different management functions and
            different TSF data.

     Initialization Data and Pre-personalization Data
           Hierarchical to:           No other components.

           Dependencies:              FMT_SMF.1 Specification of management functions

           FMT_MTD.1.1/INI_DIS                 The TSF shall restrict the ability to disable read access for users to 59
                                               the Initialization Data60 to the Personalization Agent61.

     193    Application note: According to P.Manufact the IC Manufacturer and the MRTD
            Manufacturer are the default users assumed by the TOE in the role Manufacturer during
            the Phase 2 “TOE Manufacturing” but the TOE is not requested to distinguish between
            these users within the role Manufacturer. The TOE may restrict the ability to write the
            Initialization Data and the Prepersonalization Data by (i) allowing to write these data only
            once and (ii) blocking the role Manufacturer at the end of the Phase 2. The IC
            Manufacturer may write the Initialization Data which includes but are not limited to the IC
            Identifier as required by FAU_SAS.1. The Initialization Data provides a unique
            identification of the IC which is used to trace the IC in the Phase 2 and 3 “personalization”
            but is not needed and may be misused in the Phase 4 “Operational Use”. Therefore the
            external read access shall be blocked. The MRTD Manufacturer will write the Pre-
            personalization Data.

12.7   Class FPT Protection of the Security Functions
     195    The TOE shall prevent inherent and forced illicit information leakage for User Data and
            TSF Data. The security functional requirement FPT_EMSEC.1 addresses the inherent
            leakage. With respect to the forced leakage they have to be considered in combination
            with the security functional requirements “Failure with preservation of secure state
            (FPT_FLS.1)” and “TSF testing (FPT_TST.1)” on the one hand and “Resistance to
            physical attack (FPT_PHP.3)” on the other. The SFRs “Limited capabilities (FMT_LIM.1)”,
            “Limited availability (FMT_LIM.2)” and “Resistance to physical attack (FPT_PHP.3)”
            together with the SAR “Security architecture description” (ADV_ARC.1) prevent
            bypassing, deactivation and manipulation of the security features or misuse of TOE
            functions.
     196    The TOE shall meet the requirement “TOE Emanation (FPT_EMSEC.1)” as specified
            below ([CC_P2]).


     FPT_EMSEC.1 TOE Emanation
           Hierarchical to:                    No other components.

           Dependencies:                       No Dependencies.

           FPT_EMSEC.1.1              The TOE shall not emit power variations, timing variations68 during
                                      command execution in excess of non-useful information69 enabling
                                      access to Personalization Agent Key(s)70 and the Document Basic
                                      Access Keys and the Active Authentication key.71

           FPT_EMSEC.1.2              The TSF shall ensure any unauthorized users72 are unable to use the
                                      following interface smart card circuit contacts and contactless73 to
                                      gain access to Personalization Agent Key(s)74 and the Document
                                      Basic Access Keys and the Active Authentication key 75.

     197    Application note: The TOE shall prevent attacks against the listed secret data where the
            attack is based on external observable physical phenomena of the TOE. Such attacks
            may be observable at the interfaces of the TOE or may be originated from internal
            operation of the TOE or may be caused by an attacker that varies the physical
            environment under which the TOE operates. The set of measurable physical phenomena
            is influenced by the technology employed to implement the smart card. The MRTD’s chip
            has to provide a smart card contactless interface but may have also (not used by the
            terminal but maybe by an attacker) sensitive contacts according to ISO/IEC 7816-2 as
            well. Examples of measurable phenomena include, but are not limited to variations in the
            power consumption, the timing of signals and the electromagnetic radiation due to internal
            operations or data transmissions.
     198    The following security functional requirements address the protection against forced illicit
            information leakage including physical manipulation.

           Hierarchical to:           No other components.

           Dependencies:              No Dependencies.

           FPT_FLS.1.1                The TSF shall preserve a secure state when the following types of failures
                                      occur:
                                      1. Exposure to out-of-range operating conditions where therefore a
                                      malfunction could occur,
                                      2. failure detected by TSF according to FPT_TST.176.


     200    The TOE shall meet the requirement “TSF testing (FPT_TST.1)” as specified below
            ([CC_P2]).


     FPT_TST.1 TSF testing
           Hierarchical to:           No other components.

           Dependencies:              No Dependencies.

           FPT_TST.1.1                The TSF shall run a suite of self tests during initial start-up and before
                                      calling a security sensitive module77 to demonstrate the correct operation of
                                      the TSF78.

           FPT_TST.1.2                The TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to verify the
                                      integrity of TSF data79.

           FPT_TST.1.3                The TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to verify the
                                      integrity of stored TSF executable code.



     201    The TOE shall meet the requirement “Resistance to physical attack (FPT_PHP.3)” as
            specified below ([CC_P2]).


     FPT_PHP.3 Resistance to physical attack
           Hierarchical to:           No other components.

           Dependencies:              No dependencies.

                                      TSF81 by responding automatically such that the SFRs are always enforced.

     202    Application note: The TOE will implement appropriate measures to continuously counter
            physical manipulation and physical probing. Due to the nature of these attacks (especially
            manipulation) the TOE can by no means detect attacks on all of its elements. Therefore,
            permanent protection against these attacks is required ensuring that the TSP could not be

                    Table 7: Coverage of Security Objectives for the TOE by SFR



  12.9.2 Rationale for the Fulfilment of the Security Objectives for the TOE
205   In the following, a detailed justification as required to show the suitability and sufficiency of
      the security functional requirements to achieve the security objectives defined for the TOE
      is given.




                                                                                                                                                                                                             P a g e 63 | 80
      OT.AC_Pers
206   The security objective OT.AC_Pers “Access Control for Personalization of logical MRTD”
      addresses the access control of the writing the logical MRTD. The write access to the
      logical MRTD data are defined by the SFR FDP_ACC.1 and FDP_ACF.1 as follows: only
      the successfully authenticated Personalization Agent is allowed to write the data of the
      groups EF.DG1 to EF.DG16 of the logical MRTD only once.
      The authentication of the terminal as Personalization Agent shall be performed by TSF
      according to SRF FIA_UAU.4 and FIA_UAU.5. The Personalization Agent can be
      authenticated either by using the BAC mechanism (FCS_CKM.1, FCS_COP.1/SHA,
      FCS_RND.1 (for key generation), and FCS_COP.1/ENC as well as FCS_COP.1/MAC)
      with the personalization key or for reasons of interoperability with the [PP-0056] by using
      the symmetric authentication mechanism (FCS_COP.1/AUTH).
      In case of using the BAC mechanism the SFR FIA_UAU.6 describes the re-authentication
      and FDP_UCT.1 and FDP_UIT.1 the protection of the transmitted data by means of
      secure messaging implemented by the cryptographic functions according to FCS_CKM.1,
      FCS_COP.1/SHA,FCS_RND.1 (for key generation), and FCS_COP.1/ENC as well as
      FCS_COP.1/MAC for the ENC_MAC_Mode.
      The SFR FMT_SMR.1 lists the roles (including Personalization Agent) and the SFR
      FMT_SMF.1 lists the TSF management functions (including Personalization) setting the
      Document Basic Access Keys according to the SFR FMT_MTD.1/KEY_WRITE as
      authentication reference data. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ prevents read access to
      the secret key of the Personalization Agent Keys and ensure together with the SFR
      FCS_CKM.4, FPT_EMSEC.1, FPT_FLS.1 and FPT_PHP.3 the confidentially of these
      keys.


      OT.Data_Int
207   The security objective OT.Data_Int “Integrity of personal data” requires the TOE to protect
      the integrity of the logical MRTD stored on the MRTD’s chip against physical manipulation
      and unauthorized writing. The write access to the logical MRTD data is defined by the
      SFR FDP_ACC.1 and FDP_ACF.1 in the same way: only the Personalization Agent is
      allowed to write the data of the groups EF.DG1 to EF.DG16 of the logical MRTD
      (FDP_ACF.1.2, rule 1) and terminals are not allowed to modify any of the data groups
      EF.DG1 to EF.DG16 of the logical MRTD (cf. FDP_ACF.1.4). The SFR FMT_SMR.1 lists
      the roles (including Personalization Agent) and the SFR FMT_SMF.1 lists the TSF
      management functions (including Personalization). The authentication of the terminal as
      Personalization Agent shall be performed by TSF according to SRF FIA_UAU.4,
      FIA_UAU.5 and FIA_UAU.6 using either FCS_COP.1/ENC and FCS_COP.1/MAC or
      FCS_COP.1/AUTH.
      The security objective OT.Data_Int “Integrity of personal data” requires the TOE to ensure
      that the inspection system is able to detect any modification of the transmitted logical
      MRTD data by means of the BAC mechanism. The SFR FIA_UAU.6, FDP_UCT.1 and
      FDP_UIT.1 requires the protection of the transmitted data by means of secure messaging
      implemented by the cryptographic functions according to FCS_CKM.1, FCS_COP.1/SHA,
      FCS_RND.1 (for key generation), and FCS_COP.1/ENC and FCS_COP.1/MAC for the
      ENC_MAC_Mode. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/KEY_WRITE requires the Personalization Agent
      to establish the Document Basic Access Keys in a way that they cannot be read by
      anyone in accordance to FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ.
      OT.Data_Confidentiality
208   The security objective OT.Data_Confidentiality “Confidentiality of personal data” requires
      the TOE to ensure the confidentiality of the logical MRTD data groups EF.DG1 to
      EF.DG16. The SFR FIA_UID.1 and FIA_UAU.1 allow only those actions before
      identification respective authentication which do not violate OT.Data_Confidentiality. In

                                                                             P a g e 64 | 80
      case of failed authentication attempts FIA_AFL.1 enforces additional waiting time
      prolonging the necessary amount of time for facilitating a brute force attack. The read
      access to the logical MRTD data is defined by the FDP_ACC.1 and FDP_ACF.1.2: the
      successful authenticated Personalization Agent is allowed to read the data of the logical
      MRTD (EF.DG1 to EF.DG16). The successful authenticated Basic Inspection System is
      allowed to read the data of the logical MRTD (EF.DG1, EF.DG2 and EF.DG5 to
      EF.DG16). The SFR FMT_SMR.1 lists the roles (including Personalization Agent and
      Basic Inspection System) and the SFR FMT_SMF.1 lists the TSF management functions
      (including Personalization for the key management for the Document Basic Access Keys).
      The SFR FIA_UAU.4 prevents reuse of authentication data to strengthen the
      authentication of the user. The SFR FIA_UAU.5 enforces the TOE to accept the
      authentication attempt as Basic Inspection System only by means of the Basic Access
      Control Authentication Mechanism with the Document Basic Access Keys. Moreover, the
      SFR FIA_UAU.6 requests secure messaging after successful authentication of the
      terminal with Basic Access Control Authentication Mechanism which includes the
      protection of the transmitted data in ENC_MAC_Mode by means of the cryptographic
      functions according to FCS_COP.1/ENC and FCS_COP.1/MAC (cf. the SFR FDP_UCT.1
      and FDP_UIT.1). (for key generation), and FCS_COP.1/ENC and FCS_COP.1/MAC for
      the ENC_MAC_Mode. The SFR FCS_CKM.1, FCS_CKM.4, FCS_COP.1/SHA
      andFCS_RND.1 establish the key management for the secure messaging keys. The SFR
      FMT_MTD.1/KEY_WRITE addresses the key management and FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ
      prevents reading of the Document Basic Access Keys.
      Note, neither the security objective OT.Data_Confidentiality nor the SFR FIA_UAU.5
      requires the Personalization Agent to use the Basic Access Control Authentication
      Mechanism or secure messaging.


      OT.Identification
209   The security objective OT.Identification “Identification and Authentication of the TOE”
      address the storage of the IC Identification Data uniquely identifying the MRTD’s chip in its
      non-volatile memory. This will be ensured by TSF according to SFR FAU_SAS.1.
      Furthermore, the TOE shall identify itself only to a successful authenticated Basic
      Inspection System in Phase 4 “Operational Use”. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA allows
      only the Manufacturer to write Initialization Data and Pre-personalization Data (including
      the Personalization Agent key). The SFR FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS allows the Personalization
      Agent to disable Initialization Data if their usage in the phase 4 “Operational Use” violates
      the security objective OT.Identification. The SFR FIA_UID.1 and FIA_UAU.1 do not allow
      reading of any data uniquely identifying the MRTD’s chip before successful authentication
      of the Basic Inspection Terminal and will stop communication after unsuccessful
      authentication attempt. In case of failed authentication attempts FIA_AFL.1 enforces
      additional waiting time prolonging the necessary amount of time for facilitating a brute
      force attack.


      OT.Prot_Abuse-Func
210   The security objective OT.Prot_Abuse-Func “Protection against Abuse of Functionality” is
      ensured by the SFR FMT_LIM.1 and FMT_LIM.2 which prevent misuse of test
      functionality of the TOE or other features which may not be used after TOE Delivery.


      OT.Prot_Inf_Leak
211   The security objective OT.Prot_Inf_Leak “Protection against Information Leakage”
      requires the TOE to protect confidential TSF data stored and/or processed in the MRTD’s
      chip against disclosure


                                                                               P a g e 65 | 80
                by measurement and analysis of the shape and amplitude of signals or the
                 time between events found by measuring signals on the electromagnetic field,
                 power consumption, clock, or I/O lines, which is addressed by the SFR
                 FPT_EMSEC.1,
                by forcing a malfunction of the TOE, which is addressed by the SFR
                 FPT_FLS.1 and FPT_TST.1, and/or
                by a physical manipulation of the TOE, which is addressed by the SFR
                 FPT_PHP.3.


      OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper
212   The security objective OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper “Protection against Physical Tampering” is
      covered by the SFR FPT_PHP.3.


      OT.Prot_Malfunction
213   235 The security objective OT.Prot_Malfunction “Protection against Malfunctions” is
      covered by (i) the SFR FPT_TST.1 which requires self tests to demonstrate the correct
      operation and tests of authorized users to verify the integrity of TSF data and TSF code,
      and (ii) the SFR FPT_FLS.1 which requires a secure state in case of detected failure or
      operating conditions possibly causing a malfunction.


      OT.Active_Auth_MRTD_Proof
214   The security objective OT.Active_Auth_MRTD_Proof “Proof of MRTD’s chip authenticity
      by Active Authentication”      “is covered by the SFRs FCS_COP.1.1/AA_RSA,
      FCS_COP.1.1/AA_ECDSA, FMT_MTD.1/KEY_WRITE and FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ.


  12.9.3 SFR Dependency Rationale
215   The dependency analysis for the security functional requirements shows that the basis for
      mutual support and internal consistency between all defined functional requirements is
      satisfied. All dependencies between the chosen functional components are analyzed, and
      non-dissolved dependencies are appropriately explained. The table below shows the
      dependencies between the SFR of the TOE

                           Table 8: Dependencies between the SFRs


Justification for non-satisfied dependencies between the SFR for TOE:
216   No. 1: The hash algorithm required by the SFR FCS_COP.1/SHA does not need any key
      material. Therefore neither a key generation (FCS_CKM.1) nor an import (FDP_ITC.1/2) is
      necessary.
217   No. 2: The SFR FCS_COP.1/AUTH uses the symmetric Personalization Key permanently
      stored during the Pre-Personalization process (cf. FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA) by the

                                                                                  P a g e 68 | 80
      manufacturer. Thus there is neither the necessity to generate or import a key during the
      addressed TOE lifecycle by the means of FCS_CKM.1 or FDP_ITC. Since the key is
      permanently stored within the TOE there is no need for FCS_CKM.4, too.
218   No. 3: The access control TSF according to FDP_ACF.1 uses security attributes which are
      defined during the personalization and are fixed over the whole life time of the TOE. No
      management of these security attribute (i.e. SFR FMT_MSA.1 and FMT_MSA.3) is
      necessary here.
219   No. 4: The SFR FDP_UCT.1 and FDP_UIT.1 require the use secure messaging between
      the MRTD and the BIS. There is no need for SFR FTP_ITC.1, e.g. to require this
      communication channel to be logically distinct from other communication channels since
      there is only one channel. Since the TOE does not provide a direct human interface a
      trusted path as required by FTP_TRP.1 is not applicable here.


  12.9.4 Security Assurance Requirements Rationale
220   The EAL4 was chosen to permit a developer to gain maximum assurance from positive
      security engineering based on good commercial development practices which, though
      rigorous, do not require substantial specialist knowledge, skills, and other resources. EAL4
      is the highest level at which it is likely to be economically feasible to retrofit to an existing
      product line. EAL4 is applicable in those circumstances where developers or users require
      a moderate to high level of independently assured security in conventional commodity
      TOEs and are prepared to incur sensitive security specific engineering costs.
221   The selection of the component ALC_DVS.2 provides a higher assurance of the security
      of the MRTD’s development and manufacturing especially for the secure handling of the
      MRTD’s material.
222   The component ALC_DVS.2 augmented to EAL4 has no dependencies to other security
      requirements
       Dependencies ALC_DVS.2:
                  no dependencies.


  12.9.5 Security Requirements – Mutual Support and Internal Consistency
223   The following part of the security requirements rationale shows that the set of security
      requirements for the TOE consisting of the security functional requirements (SFRs) and
      the security assurance requirements (SARs) together form a mutually supportive and
      internally consistent whole.
224   The analysis of the TOE´s security requirements with regard to their mutual support and
      internal consistency demonstrates:
      The dependency analysis in section 12.9.3 SFR Dependency Rationale for the security
      functional requirements shows that the basis for mutual support and internal consistency
      between all defined functional requirements is satisfied. All dependencies between the
      chosen functional components are analyzed, and non-satisfied dependencies are
      appropriately explained.
      The assurance class EAL4 is an established set of mutually supportive and internally
      consistent assurance requirements. The dependency analysis for the sensitive assurance
      components in section 12.9.4 Security Assurance Requirements Rationale shows that the
      assurance requirements are mutually supportive and internally consistent as all (sensitive)
      dependencies are satisfied and no inconsistency appears.
225   Inconsistency between functional and assurance requirements could only arise if there are
      functional-assurance dependencies which are not met, a possibility which has been shown


                                                                                  P a g e 69 | 80
not to arise in sections 12.9.3 SFR Dependency Rationale and 12.9.4 Security Assurance
Requirements Rationale. Furthermore, as also discussed in section 12.9.4 Security
Assurance Requirements Rationale, the chosen assurance components are adequate for
the functionality of the TOE. So the assurance requirements and security functional
requirements support each other and there are no inconsistencies between the goals of
these two groups of security requirements.




                                                                   P a g e 70 | 80
13. TOE SUMMARY SPECIFICATION
   226      The TOE provides the following TOE security functionality, which comply to the [PP-0055]:
                BAC
                Active Authentication
                Personalization Agent Authentication
                Secure Messaging
                Access Control
                Cryptographic Support
                Data Protection
   227      These Security Functions are implemented by the realisation of the Security Functional
            requirements, according to chap. 0. The details of the implementation of this TOE security
            functionality is provided in the following sections.

13.1       SF_BAC – Basic Access Control Authentication
   228      The TOE implements the Basic Access Control (BAC) mechanism to protect the Logical
            Data Structure (LDS).

13.2       SF_AA – Active Authentication
   229      The TOE implements the Active Authentication (AA) mechanism to proof the MRTD chip
            authenticity according to [ICAO_9303].

13.3       SF_AUTH – Personalization Agent Authentication
   230      The TOE implements security mechanism to authenticate external user and assign roles
            and right. The auhentication mechanism is based on AES algorithm and key length of 128
            bits. The purpose of the TSF SF_AUTH is to authenticate the roles of “Personalization
            Agent”. The Personalization Agent Authentication Key(s) are pre-loaded in the TOE. After
            a succesful authentication the “Personalization Agent” take control of the TOE and
            execute the steps and operations to initliaze the Logical Data Structure (LDS)

13.4       SF_SM - Secure Messaging
   231      The TOE implements a trusted channel providing confidentiality and integrity of transferred
            data. The trusted channel is using TripleDES cipher for encryption in CBC mode. The
            message authentication code is based on Retail-MAC. The SFR SF_SM uses new fresh
            random at each set up of the trusted channel between TOE and Basic Inspection System
            (BIS).

13.5       SF_AC - Access Control
   232      This TSF checks that for each operation initiated by a subject on data (EF.COM, EF.SOD,
            EF.DG1 to EF.DG16 of the logical MRTD) and keys (Personalization agent key, Document
            Basic Access Keys), the security attributes for that roles authorization are satisfied. The
            function covers the management, write and read of stored keys and data.

13.6       SF_CRY - Cryptographic Support
   233      This Security Function is responsible for providing cryptographic support to all the other
            Security Functions including secure key generation and operations on data such as
            encrypt, decryption and MAC generation:
               The TSF provides the secure generation of symmetric Key for secure messaging
               The TSF provides high quality Random Number Generator
               The TSF provides Hashing Cryptographic operation for key derivation



                                                                                      P a g e 71 | 80
               The TSF provides TripleDES cipher for encryption/decryption in CBC mode and
                cryptographic key size 112 bits
               The TSF provides AES cipher for encryption/decryption in CBC mode and cryptographic
                key size 128 bits
               The TSF provides message authentication based on Retail-MAC and cryptographic key
                size 112 bits
               Secure destruction of cryptographic key secret or private material
   234         This TSF enforces protection of Key material during cryptographic functions processing
               and Key Generation, against state-of-the-art attacks, including IC power consumption
               analysis

13.7       SF_PRO – Data Protection
   235         This Security Function is responsible for protection of the TSF data, user data, and TSF
               functionality. The TSF SF_RPO Data Protection is composed of software implementations
               of test and security functions including:
               Performing self-tests of the TOE at each power-up including a set of tests to verify that
                the underlying cryptographic algorithms are operating correctly
               Initializing memory after reset
               Initializing memory of de-allocated data
               Preserving the TOE lifecycle state integrity to ensure that the testing/debugging features
                used during development remain irreversibly deactivated for deployment in order to
                ensure User and TSF Data confidentiality
               Protecting the integrity of all stored cryptographic keys before use and preventing use of
                corrupted data by stopping the operation involved and setting an error.
               Preventing electromagnetic and power emissions or associated information like timing
                behaviour, in order to preserve the confidentiality of stored keys or residual key material
                information
               Preserving secure state after sensitive processing failure (RNG, power loss, memory or
                functional failure) or potential physical tampering or intrusion detection


13.8       SF_OSPlat        Java Platform and OS

13.9   Statement of Compatibility
   237   This is a Statement of Compatibility between this Composite ST and the IC Platform ST of
         the hardware and associated crypto-library ST31G480 [ST_ST31G480].The following
         mappings regarding SFRs, objectives and assurance requirements demonstrate the
         compatibility between the Composite Security Target and the IC platform ST31G480 ST.
   238   The IC platform ST31G480 SFRs, Policies, Objectives and Assumptions related to
         MFPlus and DESFire [ST_ST31G480] are not relevant since they are not in the scope of
         this TOE.
   239   The table below shows the mapping between the IC platform ST31G480 SFRs and the
         Composite ST SFRs. Both the relevant and the irrelevant SFRs are listed.
