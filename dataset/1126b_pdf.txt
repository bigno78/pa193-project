The TOE hardware consists of a core, a memory system and peripherals.
The major components of the core system are a 32-bit CPU (Central Processing Unit), an MPU (Memory
Protection Unit), a Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC) and an Instruction Stream Signature Checking
(ISS).
The MPU of the core stores code and data in a linear 4-GByte memory space (32-bit range), allowing direct
access without the need to swap memory segments in and out of memory using a memory protection unit.
There are two separate bus entities: a memory bus and a peripheral bus for high-speed communication with
the peripherals.
The SPAU can be configured by the user to block or allow peripheral access. It can also be used to block RAM
areas (For keeping Figure 1 simple, the connection between SPAU and RAM is not shown). The CPAU enables
the user to block or allow unprivileged level access to NVM and specific registers of ICS and NVM.
The CPU accesses memory via the Internal Ciphering System (ICS), which encrypts/decrypts memory content.
All data of the memory block is encrypted. The NVM is equipped with an error correction code (ECC). Security
modules manage the alarms. Alarms may be triggered when the environmental conditions are outside the
specified operational range.
A set of sensors (temperature sensor, backside light detector, glitch sensor, low frequency sensor) is used to
detect excessive deviations from the specified operational range and serve for robustness of the TOE. The
UMSLC function can be used to test the alarm lines.

Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)

A True Random Number Generator (TRNG) specially designed for smart card applications is implemented. The
TRNG a class PTG.2 random number generator of [6] and produces genuine random numbers which can be
used internally or by the user software.
The micro Symmetric Cryptographic Processor (µSCP) supports calculation of dual-key or triple-key triple-DES
and AES.
The implemented sleep mode logic (clock stop mode per ISO/IEC 7816-3) is used to reduce overall power
consumption.
The UART- or GPIO-controlled I/O interface allows the smart card controller and the terminal interface to be
operated independently.
The UMSLC enables the user software to check the activity and proper function of the system’s security
features.
The Clock Unit (CLKU) supplies the clocks for all components of the TOE. The Clock Unit can work in internal
and external clock mode. When operating the internal clock mode the system frequency is derived from an
oscillator, whereas in external clock mode, the system clock is derived from an externally supplied interface
clock.
The watchdog timer triggers an event in case of a counter overflow. The timers are general purpose up-
counting timers.
The ROM is used by IFX only. The user software has to be implemented in SOLID FLASHҹ memory. The user can
choose, whether the software is loaded into the SOLID FLASHҹ memory by Infineon Technologies AG or by the
user.
The TOE uses Special Function Registers (SFRs). These SFRs are used for general purposes and chip
configuration; they are located in SOLID FLASHҹ memory in a configuration area page. The Online
Configuration Check (OCC) function is used for register protection, i.e. controls the modification of relevant
SFR settings.
In case a security violation is detected, secure state is entered by the hardware.

1.4.1.2                Firmware and software components
The TOE provides low-level firmware components: the Boot Software (BOS) and the Flash Loader (FL).
The BOS firmware is used for test purposes during start-up and the FL allows downloading of user software to
the NVM during the manufacturing process. All mandatory functions for start-up and internal testing are
protected by a dedicated hardware firewall with two levels “BOS” and “user”.
The flash loader allows downloading of User Software into the NVM during the manufacturing process. It uses
the µSCP to download encrypted user data.
The software of the TOE consists of packages:
 Optional Symmetric Crypto Library (SCL): The optional SCL is used to provide a high level interface to the
  TDES and AES cryptography, which is partly implemented on the hardware component µSCP and includes
  countermeasures against SPA, DPA and DFA attacks. The SCL is delivered as object code and in this way
  integrated into the user software.
 Optional Hardware Support Library (HSL): provides functionality via APIs to the Smartcard Embedded
  Software . which contains SOLID FLASHҹ NVM service routines and functionality for tearing safe
  programming of SOLID FLASHҹ NVM.

Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)

   UMSLC lib: this library provides a wrapper around the UMSLC hardware functionality with measures to
    counter fault attacks.

1.4.1.3                User Guidance components
The user guidance consists of the components as follows:
   32-bit Security Controller – V02, Hardware Reference Manual: description of hardware features and user
    interfaces
   32-bit ARM-based Securtity Controller, SLC 37/40-nm Technology, Programmer’s Reference Manual:
    description of firmware principles relevant for IC embedded software.
   Production and personalization 32-bit ARM-based security cvontroller:contains detailed information about
    the usage of the Flash Loader
   32-bit Security Controller – V02, Security Guidelines: provides the guidance and recommendations to
    develop secure software for and secure usage of this TOE.
   HSL library for SLCx7 in 40nm: provides an application interface (API) description and security guidelines for
    the optional HSL software part.
   UMSLC library for SLCx7 in 40nm, Version 01.00.0234: provides some guidelines, how to use the UMSLC
    library
   SCL37-uSCP-v3-C40 Symmetric Crypto Library for uSCP-v3 DES / AES (optional): User Interface, contains all
    interfaces of the SCL. This document is only delivered to the user in case the SCL is part of the delivered
    TOE.

1.4.2                  Physical scope of the TOE
The physical scope of the TOE is defined by the TOE components described in chapter 1.4.1

1.4.3                  Logical scope of the TOE
The logical scope of the TOE consists of the logical security features provided by the TOE. These features are
listed in chapter 1.3.2. More details are provided in this chapter:
   Cryptographic support: TDES, AES (block cipher modes ECB, CBC, CFB, CTR and CMAC); RNG (PTG.2
    according to [6])
   Memory protection unit supporting up to eight memory regions with different access rights and two
    privilege levels “privileged” and “user”. “User” level is more restricted in using TOE resources compared to
    “privileged”
   Memory encryption: all data of memories ROM, RAM and NVM are encrypted. Addresses are scrambled to
    disguise the location of data
   Robust set of sensors and detectors for the purpose of monitoring proper chip operating conditions
    consisting of a temperature sensor, backside light detector, glitch sensor and low frequency sensor.
   Redundant alarm propagation and system deactivation principle, which decreases the risk of manipulation
    and tampering.
   Register protection: protection of security relevant registers against fault attacks using OCC.
   Security life control: a life test on specific security features can be used by the IC embedded software to
    detect manipulation of these security features
   Program flow integrity protection: The Instruction Stream Signature Checking (ISS) can be employed by the
    IC embedded software to detect illegal program flows and trigger an alarm. The TOE also contains a
    watchdog, which may be used to detect program flow manipulations.

Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)

   Peripheral access control: The TOE allows the IC embedded software to lock certain peripherals
    dynamically.
   Bus encryption for security peripherals: All data transfers to and from dedicated peripherals are encrypted
    dynamically.
   Tearing safe NVM programming: the HSL provides specific routines provided for tearing safe programming.
    These routines prevent an unspecified interim state by either propagating the pre- or post-programming
    condition.
   Security optimized wiring: shield lines in combination with layout measures reduce the risk of successful
    manipulative attacks.
   Leakage control of data dependant code execution: dedicated measures allow the user to reduce such
    leakage.
   Device phase management supporting isolation of test features and flash loader accessibility: dedicated
    test features employed during production are switched off before customer delivery. The flash loader usage
    to download flash data requires a mutual authentication. The flash loader supports permanent
    deactivation.
   Detection of NVM single and multi bit errors: Single bit errors are detected and corrected and multi bit errors
    detected.

1.4.4                  Interfaces of the TOE
   The physical interface of the TOE to the external environment is the entire surface of the IC.
   The electrical interface of the TOE to the external environment is constituted by the pads of the chip:
             o The five ISO 7816 pads consist particularly of the contacted RES, I/O, CLK lines and supply lines
                 VCC and GND. The contact based communication is according to ISO 7816/ETSI/EMV.
             o The I2C communication can be driven via the ISO 7816 pads. In this case no other
                 communication using the ISO 7816 pads is possible.
   The data-oriented I/O interface of the TOE is represented by the I/O pad.
   The interface between firmware and hardware consists of special registers used for hardware configuration
    and control (Special Function Registers, SFR).
   Optional: The interface of the TOE to the operating system is covered by the optional HSL routines and by
    the instruction set of the TOE.
   The interface of the UMSLC lib defined by the UMSLC lib
   Optional: The interface to the SCL calculations is defined by the SCL

1.4.5          Forms of Delivery
The TOE can be delivered in the form of complete modules, as plain wafers in an IC case (e.g. DSO20) or in bare
dies. The delivery can therefore be at the end of phase 3 or at the end of phase 4 which may also include pre-
personalization steps according to [1]. This means phase 4 is also part of the evaluation process. In any case the
testing of the TOE is finished and the extended test features are removed. From a security policy point of view
the different forms of delivery do not have any impact.
The delivery to the software developer (phase 2  phase 1) contains the documents as described above.
Part of the software delivery is the Flash Loader program, provided by Infineon Technologies AG, running on
the TOE and controlling the download of user software onto the TOE via the UART interface. The download is
only possible after successful authentication. The user software and data must be encrypted before download.
In addition, the user can permanently block further use of the Flash Loader.
The table as follows provides an overview about form and method of TOE deliveries:

Security Target Lite

Conformance Claims (ASE_CCL)

2.4                    Conformance Rationale
This Security Target Lite claims strict conformance to [1].
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is a typical security IC as defined in [1] chapter 1.2.2 comprising:
   the circuitry of the IC (hardware including the physical memories),
   configuration data, initialisation data related to the IC Dedicated Software and the behaviour of the security
    functionality
   the IC Dedicated Software with the parts
   the IC Dedicated Test Software,
   the IC Dedicated Support Software.
   The user guidance documents
The TOE is designed, produced and/or generated by the TOE Manufacturer.

2.4.1                  Security Problem Definition:
The Security Target Lite definition of [1] is enhanced by adding a threat. Including this add-on, the security
problem definition of this Security Target Lite is consistent with the statement of the security problem
definition in [1], as the Security Target Lite claims strict conformance to [1].

2.4.2                  Conformance Rationale:
The threat memory access violation T.Mem-Access has been added, due to specific TOE memory access control
functionality. This add-on has no impact on the conformance statements regarding CC [2] and PP [1], with
following rational:
 The Security Target Lite remains conformant to CC [2], claim 576 as the possibility to introduce additional
  restrictions is given.
 The Security Target Lite fulfils the strict conformance claim of the PP [1] due to the application notes 5, 6
  and 7 which apply here. By those notes the addition of further security functions and security services are
  covered, even without deriving particular security functionality from a threat but from a policy.

2.4.3                  Adding Objective
Due to an additional security functionality regarding memory access control - O.Mem-Access, an additional
security objective has been introduced. This add-on has no impact on the conformance statements regarding
CC [2] and PP [1], with following rational:
   The Security Target Lite remains conformant to CC [2], claim 576 as the possibility to introduce additional
    restrictions is given.

2.4.4                  Summary
Due to the above rational, the security objectives of this Security Target Lite are consistent with the statement
of the security objectives in [1], as the Security Target Lite claims package-augmentation to [1].
All security functional requirements defined in [1] are included and completely defined in this ST.
The following security functional requirements are taken from [3] in addition to the SFRs defined in [1]:

Security Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)


3                      Security Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)
The content of [1] applies to this chapter completely.

3.1                    Threats
The threats are directed against the assets and/or the security functions of the TOE. For example, certain
attacks are only one step towards a disclosure of assets while others may directly lead to a compromise of the
application security. The more detailed description of specific attacks is given later on in the process of
evaluation and certification. An overview on attacks is given in PP [1] section 3.2.
The threats to security are defined and described in PP [1] sections 3.2 and 7.2.1.

Table 7        Threats according to [1]
 T.Phys-Manipulation           Physical Manipulation
 T.Phys-Probing                Physical Probing
 T.Malfunction                 Malfunction due to Environmental Stress
 T.Leak-Inherent               Inherent Information Leakage
 T.Leak-Forced                 Forced Information Leakage
 T.Abuse-Func                  Abuse of Functionality
 T.RND                         Deficiency of Random Numbers
 T.Masquerade_TOE (only        Masquerade the TOE
 relevant , if flash loader
 active)

3.1.1                  Additional Threat due to TOE specific Functionality
The additional functionality of introducing sophisticated privilege levels and access control allows the secure
separation between the operation system(s) and applications, the secure downloading of applications after
personalization and enables multitasking by separating memory areas and performing access controls
between different applications. Due to this additional functionality “area based memory access control” a new
threat is introduced.
The TOE shall avert the threat “Memory Access Violation (T.Mem-Access)” as specified below:
T.Mem-Access              Memory Access Violation
                          Parts of the Smartcard Embedded Software may cause security violations by
                          accidentally or deliberately accessing restricted data (which may include code) or
                          privilege levels. Any restrictions are defined by the security policy of the specific
                          application context and must be implemented by the Smartcard Embedded Software.
“Diffusion of open samples” threat:
T.Open_Samples_Diffusion Diffusion of Open Samples
                          An attacker may get access to open samples of the TOE and use them to gain
                          information about the TSF (loader, memory management unit, ROM code …). He may
                          also use the open samples to characterize the behavior of the IC and its security
                          functionalities (for example: characterization of side channel profiles, perturbation
                          cartography …). The execution of a dedicated security features (for example: execution
                          of a DES computation without countermeasures or by de-activating countermeasures)

This section shows the security objectives, which are relevant to the TOE.

4.1                    Security objectives of the TOE
The security objectives of the TOE are defined and described in PP [1] sections 4.1, 7.2.1, 7.3.1, 7.3.2, 7.4.1 and

                                The TOE must provide the Smartcard Embedded Software with the capability to
                                define restricted access memory areas. The TOE must then enforce the
                                partitioning of such memory areas so that access of software to memory areas
                                and privilege levels is controlled as required, for example, in a multi-application

4.3                    Security Objectives Rationale
The security objectives rationale of the TOE is defined and described in PP [1] section 4.4, 7.3.1, 7.3.2, 7.4.1 and
section 7.4.2.
Compared to [1] an enhancement regarding memory area protection has been established. The clear definition
of privilege levels for operated software establishes the clear separation of different restricted memory areas
for running the firmware, downloading and/or running the operating system and to establish a clear separation
between different applications. Nevertheless, it is also possible to define a shared memory section where
separated applications may exchange defined data. The privilege levels clearly define by using a hierarchical
model the access right from one level to the other. These measures ensure that the threat T.Mem-Access is
clearly covered by the security objective O.Mem-Access.
The objectives O.Authentication, O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader and the organizational policiy P.Ctlr_Loader and the
environmental objective OE.TOE_Auth as described in [1] chapter 7.2 and 7.3.2 apply only to TOE products with
Flash Loader enabled for software or data download by the user. In other cases the Flash Loader is not
available anymore and the user software or data download is completed.
The objective O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality counters the threat T.Open_Samples_Diffusion. In addition
T.Open_Samples_Diffusion is countered by O.Leak-Inherent and O.Leak-Forced.

Extended Component Definition (ASE_ECD)


5                      Extended Component Definition (ASE_ECD)
There are several extended components defined and described for the TOE:
   the family FCS_RNG at the class FCS Cryptographic Support
   the family FMT_LIM at the class FMT Security Management
   the family FAU_SAS at the class FAU Security Audit
   the family FDP_SDC at the class FDP User Data Protection
   the family FIA_API at the class FIA Identification and Authentication
   the component FPT_TST.2 at the class FPT Protection of the TSF
The extended families FCS_RNG, FMT_LIM, FAU_SAS, FDP_SDC and FIA_API are defined and described in PP [1]
section 5. The component FPT_TST.2 is defined in the following sections.

5.1                    Component “Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)”
The security is strongly dependent on the correct operation of the security functions. Therefore, the TOE shall
support that particular security functions or mechanisms are tested in the operational phase (Phase 7). The
tests can be initiated by the Smartcard Embedded Software and/or by the TOE or is done automatically and
continuously.
Part 2 of the Common Criteria provides the security functional component “TSF testing (FPT_TST.1)”. The
component FPT_TST.1 provides the ability to test the TSF’s correct operation.
For the user it is important to know which security functions or mechanisms can be tested. The functional
component FPT_TST.1 does not mandate to explicitly specify the security functions being tested. In addition,
FPT_TST.1 requires verification of the integrity of TSF data and of the stored TSF executable code which might
violate the security policy. Therefore, the functional component ”Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)”
of the family TSF self test has been newly created. This component allows that particular parts of the security
mechanisms and functions provided by the TOE are tested.

5.2                    Definition of FPT_TST.2
The functional component “Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)” has been newly created (Common
Criteria Part 2 extended). This component allows that particular parts of the security mechanisms and
functions provided by the TOE can be tested after TOE Delivery or are tested automatically and continuously
during normal operation transparent for the user.
This security functional component is used instead of the functional component FPT_TST.1 from Common
Criteria Part 2. For the user it is important to know which security functions or mechanisms can be tested. The
functional component FPT_TST.1 does not mandate to explicitly specify the security functions being tested. In
addition, FPT_TST.1 requires verifying the integrity of TSF data and stored TSF executable code which might
violate the security policy.
The functional component “Subset TOE testing (FPT_TST.2)” is specified as follows (Common Criteria Part 2
extended).

                   request of the authorized user, or when other conditions are met. It also provides the ability to
                   verify the integrity of TSF data and executable code.
Management: FPT_TST.2
The following actions could be considered for the management functions in FMT:
 management of the conditions under which subset TSF self testing occurs, such as during initial start-up,

6.1.1                    Definition required by [1]
According to [1] Application Note 14 the term “secure state” used by FPT_FLS.1 shall be described and a
definition should be provided.
Definition of secure state:
Secure state describes three different conditions of the TOE:
1. the controller ceases operation. This condition can only be resolved by a cold or warm start of the
   controller. It is triggered by a security reset.
2. the controller enters a security trap. The trap handler can be defined by the user. In case no trap handler is
   provided the first condition is entered.
3. in case of a sudden power loss of the TOE during NVM programming (tearing): the TOE is in a condition to
   either restore the old NVM content or to start with the new programmed value. This condition of security
   state is only provided in case the HSL is part of the TOE and one of the tearing-safe functions of the HSL is
   used.
Note: a security reset invalidates the RAM content.
According to [1] Application Note 15, “The Common Criteria suggest that the TOE generates audit data for the
security functional requirements Limited fault tolerance (FRU_FLT.2) and Failure with preservation of secure
state (FPT_FLS.1).” In case of the first two conditions no Audit data are collected, because the effect entering
the secure state is immediately visible. For the third condition indirect audit data is available, i.e. the user can
check, whether new or old NVM data is available.

6.1.2.1                  FCS_RNG
To define the IT security functional requirements of the TOE an additional family (FCS_RNG) of the Class FCS
(cryptographic support) is defined in [1]. This family describes the functional requirements for random number
generation used for cryptographic purposes.

         PTG.2.2If a total failure of the entropy source occurs while the RNG is being operated, the RNG prevents
                the output of any internal random number that depends on some raw random numbers that
                have been generated after the total failure of the entropy source.
         PTG.2.3The online test shall detect non-tolerable statistical defects of the raw random number
                sequence (i) immediately when the RNG has started, and (ii) while the RNG is being operated.
                The TSF must not output any random numbers before the power-up online test has finished
                successfully or when a defect has been detected.
         PTG.2.4The online test procedure shall be effective to detect non-tolerable weaknesses of the random
                numbers soon.
         PTG.2.5 The online test procedure checks the quality of the raw random number sequence. It is
                triggered continuously. The online test is suitable for detecting non-tolerable statistical defects
                of the statistical properties of the raw random numbers within an acceptable period of time.


FCS_RNG.1.2        The TSF shall provide numbers in the format 32-bit that meet

6.1.2.2                FAU_SAS
The [1] defines additional security functional requirements with the family FAU_SAS of the class FAU (Security
Audit). This family describes the functional requirements for the storage of audit data. It has a more general
approach than FAU_GEN, because it does not necessarily require the data to be generated by the TOE itself and
because it does not give specific details of the content of the audit records.
The TOE shall meet the requirement “Audit storage (FAU_SAS.1)” as specified below (Common Criteria Part 2

6.1.5                  Memory access control
Usage of multiple applications in one Smartcard often requires code and data separation in order to prevent
one application from accessing code and/or data of another application. For this reason the TOE provides Area
based Memory Access Control. The underlying memory protection unit (MPU) is documented in [7].
The security service being provided is described in the Security Function Policy (SFP) Memory Access Control
Policy. The security functional requirement “Subset access control (FDP_ACC.1)” requires that this policy is
in place and defines the scope were it applies. The security functional requirement “Security attribute based
access control (FDP_ACF.1)” defines security attribute usage and characteristics of policies. It describes the
rules for the function that implements the Security Function Policy (SFP) as identified in FDP_ACC.1. The
decision whether an access is permitted or not is taken based upon attributes allocated to the software. The
Smartcard Embedded Software defines the attributes and memory areas. The corresponding permission
control information is evaluated “on-the-fly” by the hardware so that access is granted/effective or
denied/inoperable.
The security functional requirement “Static attribute initialisation (FMT_MSA.3)” claims that the default
values of security attributes are appropriate either permissive or restrictive in nature. Alternative values can be
specified by any subject provided that the Memory Access Control Policy allows that. This is described by the
security functional requirement “Management of security attributes (FMT_MSA.1)”. The attributes are
determined during TOE manufacturing (FMT_MSA.3) or set at run-time (FMT_MSA.1).
From TOE’s point of view the different roles in the Smartcard Embedded Software can be distinguished
according to the memory based access control. However the definition of the roles belongs to the user
software.
The following Security Function Policy (SFP) Memory Access Control Policy is defined for the requirement
“Security attribute based access control (FDP_ACF.1)”:

6.1.6                  Memory Access Control Policy
The TOE shall support the standard ARMv7 Protected Memory System Architecture model.
The MPU provides full support for:
  Protection regions.
 Overlapping protection regions, with ascending region priority:
  − Region 7 = highest priority.
  − Region 0 = lowest priority.
 Access permissions.
 MPU mismatches and permission violations invoke the programmable-priority MemManage fault handler.

The MPU can be used to:
 Enforce privilege rules, preventing user applications from corrupting operating system data.
 Separate processes, blocking the active task from accessing other tasks’ data.

Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)

     Enforce access rules, allowing memory regions to be defined as read-only or detecting unexpected memory
      accesses.

Subjects, Objects and Operations of the policy
 Subjects: privilege or non-privilege level of the ARM processor
 Objects: memory/code addresses
 Operations: Read a/o write a/o execute access

Attributes of the policy:
 MPU enable/disable bit.
 8 regions with the following attributes
   − A unique priority
   − The enable bit
   − the start address and size
   − an access matrix which defines if an Operation of a Subject to an Object lying in the region is allowed or
      denied
 The default region with the following security attribute:
   − A bit which defines if an Operation for the Subject (privilege level) is allowed or if no Operation is allowed
      for any Subject.

Roles of the policy:
The roles correspond 1-1 to the subjects.

Properties of the policy:
 If an address is contained in multiple enabled regions, then the region with the highest priority defines the
   access rights.
 If an address is contained in no region then the default region defines the access rights.
 The region defining the access rights checks in the access matrix if the Subject has access to the Object with
   respect to the desired Operation. In case the access is denied the MPU throws an access violation exception.


Access rules between privilege level and non-privilege level:
 the privilege level has access to regions which are defined for non-privilege level access
 the non-privilege level has no access to the regions which are defined for privilege level access

6.3                    Security Requirements Rationale

6.3.1                  Rationale for the Security Functional Requirements
While the security functional requirements rationale of the TOE are defined and described in [1] section 6.3.1,
7.2.3, 7.3.1, 7.3.2, 7.4.1 and 7.4.2, the additional introduced SFR are discussed below:

                                      -       FMT_SMF.1 “Specification of Management Functions”
 O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality           -      FTP_ITC.1 Inter-TSF-trusted channel

                                      -      FDP_ACF.1/Loader Security attribute based access control –
                                      Loader

The table above gives an overview, how the security functional requirements are combined to meet the
security objectives (this table has to be read in addition to [1] table 2 “Security Requirements versus Security
Objectives”. The detailed justification is given in the following:
The security functional component Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2) has been newly created (Common
Criteria Part 2 extended). This component allows that particular parts of the security mechanisms and
functions provided by the TOE can be tested after TOE Delivery. This security functional component is used
instead of the functional component FPT_TST.1 from Common Criteria Part 2. For the user it is important to
know which security functions or mechanisms can be tested. The functional component FPT_TST.1 does not
mandate to explicitly specify the security functions being tested. In addition, FPT_TST.1 requires verification of
the integrity of TSF data and stored TSF executable code which might violate the security policy.
The security functional requirement FPT_TST.2 detects attempts to conduce a physical manipulation on the
monitoring functions of the TOE. The objective of FPT_TST.2 is O.Phys-Manipulation.
The security functional requirement “Subset access control (FDP_ACC.1)” with the related Security Function
Policy (SFP) “Memory Access Control Policy” exactly require the implementation of an area based memory
access control as required by O.Mem-Access. The related TOE security functional requirements FDP_ACC.1,
FDP_ACF.1, FMT_MSA.3, FMT_MSA.1 and FMT_SMF.1 cover this security objective. The implementation of these
functional requirements is represented by the dedicated privilege level concept.
The objective O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality is met by the loader access control (FDP_ACC.1/Loader and
FDP_ACF.1/Loader) and trusted channel (FTP_ITC.1) for loading code. This prevents unauthorized users from
generating open samples.
The justification of the security objective and the additional requirements show that they do not contradict the
rationale already given in [1] for the assumptions, policy and threats defined there.
Nevertheless, the developer of the Smartcard Embedded Software must ensure that the additional functions
are used as specified and that the User Data processed by these functions are protected as defined for the

Comment 1:
The dependency FMT_SMR.1 introduced by the two components FMT_MSA.1 and FMT_MSA.3 is considered to
be satisfied because the access control specified for the intended TOE is not role-based but enforced for each
subject (user). Therefore, there is no need to identify roles in form of a security functional requirement
FMT_SMR.1.
End of comment.
Comment 2:
The security functional requirement “Cryptographic operation (FCS_COP.1)” met by the TOE has the following
dependencies:
    [FDP_ITC.1 Import of user data without security attributes, or
    FDP_ITC.2 Import of user data with security attributes or
    FCS_CKM.1 Cryptographic key generation]
    FCS_CKM.4 Cryptographic key destruction.

Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)

These requirements all address the appropriate management of cryptographic keys used by the specified
cryptographic function and are not part of [1]. Most requirements concerning key management shall be fulfilled
by the environment since the Smartcard Embedded Software is designed for a specific application context and
uses the cryptographic functions provided by the TOE.
For the security functional requirement FCS_COP.1/3DES and FCS_COP.1/AES the respective dependency
[FCS_CKM.1 or FDP_ITC.1 or FDP_ITC.2] has to be fulfilled by the environment.
The same applies for FCS_CKM.4. Its dependencies differ slightly from FCS_COP.1, however the rationale is the
same.
End of comment.
Comment 3:
The inter-TSF trusted channel SFR FTP_ITC.1 has no dependency and is provided as main purpose by the Flash
Loader. The Flash Loader provides a distinct and independent communication channel with authenticated end
points and protection from modification or disclosure.
The dependency FMT_MSA.3 introduced by the component FDP_ACF.1/Loader is considered to be not required,
because the security attributes enforcing the Loader SFP are fixed by the IC manufacturer and no new objects
under the control of the Loader SFP are created. The Loader SFP also does not create any new security
attributes and the security attributes are fixed during the download process. Claim 371 of [1] applies.
End of comment.



6.3.2                  Rationale of the Assurance Requirements
The chosen assurance level EAL5 and the augmentation with the requirements ALC_DVS.2 and AVA_VAN.5 were
chosen in order to meet the assurance expectations explained in the following paragraphs. In Table 17 the
different assurance levels are shown as well as the augmentations. The augmentations are in compliance with
the Protection Profile.
An assurance level EAL5 with the augmentations ALC_DVS.2 and AVA_VAN.5 are required for this type of TOE
since it is intended to defend against highly sophisticated attacks without protective environment. This
evaluation assurance package was selected to permit a developer to gain maximum assurance from positive
security engineering based on good commercial practices. In order to provide a meaningful level of assurance
that the TOE provides an adequate level of defence against such attacks, the evaluators should have access to
all information regarding the TOE including the TSF internals, the low level design and source code including
the testing of the modular design. Additionally the mandatory technical document [11] shall be taken as a basis
for the vulnerability analysis of the TOE.

ALC_DVS.2 Sufficiency of security measures
Development security is concerned with physical, procedural, personnel and other technical measures that
may be used in the development environment to protect the TOE.
In the particular case of a Security IC the TOE is developed and produced within a complex and distributed
industrial process which must especially be protected. Details about the implementation, (e.g. from design,
test and development tools as well as Initialization Data) may make such attacks easier. Therefore, in the case
of a Security IC, maintaining the confidentiality of the design is very important.
This assurance component is a higher hierarchical component to EAL5 (which only requires ALC_DVS.1).
ALC_DVS.2 has no dependencies.

Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)

AVA_VAN.5 Advanced methodical vulnerability analysis
Due to the intended use of the TOE, it must be shown to be highly resistant to penetration attacks. This
assurance requirement is achieved by AVA_VAN.5.
Independent vulnerability analysis is based on highly detailed technical information. The main intent of the
evaluator analysis is to determine that the TOE is resistant to penetration attacks performed by an attacker
possessing high attack potential.
AVA_VAN.5 has dependencies to ADV_ARC.1 “Security architecture description”, ADV_FSP.4 “Complete
functional specification”, ADV_TDS.3 “Basic modular design”, ADV_IMP.1 “Implementation representation of
the TSF”, AGD_OPE.1 “Operational user guidance”, AGD_PRE.1 “Preparative procedures” and ATE_DPT.1
“Testing: basic design”
All these dependencies are satisfied by EAL5.
It has to be assumed that attackers with high attack potential try to attack Security ICs like smartcards used for
digital signature applications or payment systems. Therefore, specifically AVA_VAN.5 was chosen in order to
assure that even these attackers cannot successfully attack the TOE.

TOE Summary Specification (ASE_TSS)


7                      TOE Summary Specification (ASE_TSS)
The product overview is given in Section 1.3.1. The Security Features are described below and the relation to
the security functional requirements is shown.
The TOE is equipped with the following security features to meet the security functional requirements:

Table 20       TOE Security Features
 SF_DPM                                Device Phase Management
 SF_PS                                 Protection against Snooping
 SF_PMA                                Protection against Modification Attacks
 SF_PLA                                Protection against Logical Attacks
 SF_CS                                 Cryptographic Support

The following description of the security features is a complete representation of the TSF.

7.1                    SF_DPM: Device Phase Management
The life cycle of the TOE is split up into several phases. Different operation modes help to protect the TOE
during each phase of its lifecycle.

7.2                    SF_PS: Protection against Snooping
The TOE uses various means to protect from snooping of memories and busses and prevents single stepping.

7.3                    SF_PMA: Protection against Modifying Attacks
This TOE implements protection against modifying attacks of memories, alarm lines, sensors and instruction
execution order.

7.4                    SF_PLA: Protection against Logical Attacks
Memory access of the TOE is controlled by a Memory Protection Unit (MPU), which implements different
priviledge levels. The MPU decides, whether access to a physical memory location is allowed based on access
rights.

7.5                    SF_CS: Cryptographic Support
The TOE is equipped with a hardware accelerator and symmetric cryptographic library (SCL) to support the
standard symmetric cryptographic operations TDES and AES. It further provides random numbers to meet
FCS_RNG.1

7.6                    Assignment of Security Functional Requirements to TOE’s Security
                       Functionality
The justification and overview of the mapping between security functional requirements (SFR) and the TOE’s
security functionality (SF) is given in the sections above. The results are shown in Table 21. The security
functional requirements are addressed by at least one related security feature.

The functional requirement FPT_TST.2 requires further protection to prevent manipulation of test results,
while checking the security functions of the TOE. An attacker could aim to switch off or disturb certain sensors
or filters and prevent the detection of distortion by blocking the correct operation of FPT_TST.2. The security
functional requirements required to meet the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing,
O.Malfunction, O.Phys-Manipulation and O.Leak-Forced also protect the security functional requirement
FPT_TST.2. Therefore, the related security functional requirements support the secure implementation and
operation of FPT_TST.2.

TOE Summary Specification (ASE_TSS)

The requirement FPT_TST.2 allows testing of some security mechanisms by the Smartcard Embedded Software
after delivery.
The implemented privilege level concept represents the area based memory access protection enforced by the
MPU. As an attacker could attempt to manipulate the level concept as defined and present in the TOE, the
functional requirement FDP_ACC.1 and the related other requirements have to be protected. The security
functional requirements necessary to meet the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing,
O.Malfunction, O.Phys-Manipulation and O.Leak-Forced also protect the area based memory access control
function implemented according to the security functional requirement described in the security functional
requirement FDP_ACC.1 with reference to the Memory Access Control Policy and details given in FDP_ACF.1.
Therefore, those security functional requirements support the secure implementation and operation of
FDP_ACF.1 with its dependent security functional requirements.
