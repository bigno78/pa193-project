1.2 ST overview
This document contains the Security Target for MRTD chips based on the MRTD-EAC application of the NXP
eDoc Suite v3.0 – cryptovision ePasslet Suite. The NXP eDoc Suite v3.0 – cryptovision ePasslet Suite is a set
of Javacard applications intended to be used exclusively on the NXP JCOP Javacard OS platforms, which are
certified according to CC EAL 5+ [ZertJCOP]. The NXP eDoc Suite v3.0 – cryptovision ePasslet Suite as well as
the NXP JCOP operating system are provided within the ROM mask of a smart card chip based on the NXP
P60 security controller, which is itself certified according to CC EAL 5+ [ZertIC], and certified cryptographic
library [ZertCL].


1  The TOE is available without or with different additional Banking applets in the ROM image. These Ban-
king applets are independent of the Javacard layer of the TOE; thus they are not part of the certified func-
tionality of the TOE. MChip: Mastercard M/Chip; CPA: EMVCo Common Payment Application; VSDC: Visa
Smart Debit Card. Details and procedures to obtain these values are described in section 1.3.2.1.

NXP eDoc Suite v3.0 - cryptovision ePasslet Suite / PP0056v2 based Security Target Lite


This Security Target defines the security objectives and requirements for the contact based / contactless
smart card of machine readable travel documents based on the requirements and recommendations of the
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). It addresses the advanced security methods Password Au-
thenticated Connection Establishment, Extended Access Control, and Chip Authentication similar to the Ac-
tive Authentication in ‘ICAO Doc 9303’ [ICAODoc].
This security target claims strict conformance to the Protection Profile Machine Readable Travel Document
with “ICAO Application”, Extended Access Control with PACE (EAC PP) (BSI-CC-PP0056v2) [PP0056v2] and
Protection Profile Machine Readable Travel Document using Standard Inspection Procedure with PACE
(PACE PP), BSI-CC-PP-0068-V2-2011-MA-01 [PP0068v2].
The main objectives of this ST are:
          to introduce TOE and the MRTD application,
          to define the scope of the TOE and its security features,
          to describe the security environment of the TOE, including the assets to be protected and the
           threats to be countered by the TOE and its environment during the product development, produc-
           tion and usage.
          to describe the security objectives of the TOE and its environment supporting in terms of integrity
           and confidentiality of application data and programs and of protection of the TOE.
          to specify the security requirements which includes the TOE security functional requirements, the
           TOE assurance requirements and TOE security functionalities.
The assurance level for the TOE is CC EAL5 augmented with ALC_DVS.2 and AVA_VAN.5.2


1.3 TOE overview
The TOE overview is split in two parts. Section 1.3.1 gives an overview of the complete NXP eDoc Suite v3.0
– cryptovision ePasslet Suite, section 1.3.2 describes the specific configuration that forms the TOE of this
Security Target.

1.3.1 Overview of NXP eDoc Suite v3.0 – cryptovision ePasslet Suite
NXP eDoc Suite v3.0 – cryptovision ePasslet Suite is a set of Java Card applets for e-ID document applications
built upon an underlying core library. The following Table 1 provides an overview of the individual
applications included in NXP eDoc Suite v3.0 – cryptovision ePasslet Suite:

2In comparison to PP0056v2, which aims at assurance level EAL4 augmented, the higher evaluation assur-
ance level EAL5 is target of this evaluation. Thus, the augmentation ATE_DPT.2 of PP0056v2 is superseded
by ATE.DPT.3 of the EAL5 package.

 Table 1: Configurations of the NXP eDoc Suite v3.0 – cryptovision ePasslet Suite. Please note that not all
   configurations are certified according to Common Criteria. The TOE of this ST is marked in yellow.


These configurations are based on one or more predefined applets; different configurations might use the
same underlying applet.
While the whole applet code resides in ROM, the applets providing these different configurations are in-
stantiated into EEPROM. Multiple configurations (and hence support for different applications) can be pre-
sent at the same time by instantiating multiple applets with their distinct configurations. Such additional
functionality is independent of the functionality of the TOE as described in this security target and the guid-
ance manuals. This is ensured by the isolation properties of the Java Card platform.
A common combination could be an ICAO MRTD applet and an ePKI applet providing a travel application
with LDS data and EAC authentication together with a signature application.
The following configurations are certified according to Common Criteria:
     configuration providing Machine Readable Travel Document with „ICAO Application”, Basic Access
      Control (BAC); this TOE is defined in a separate security target;
    configuration providing Machine Readable Travel Document with „ICAO Application”, Extended
      Access Control with PACE; this is the TOE of this security target;
    configuration providing Secure Signature Creation Device with key generation; this TOE is defined
      in a separate security target.
Combinations of certified and non-certified applications are possible.
Via configuration the instanciated applets can be tied to the contactless and/or the contact interface, re-
spectively.

1.3.2 TOE definition
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is the contactless integrated circuit chip containing components for a
machine readable travel document (MRTD chip). After instantiation and configuration of the NXP eDoc Suite
v3.0 – cryptovision ePasslet Suite as MRTD-EAC configuration it can be programmed according to ICAO
Technical Report “Supplemental Access Control for Machine Readable Travel Documents” [ICAO_SAC]
(which means amongst others according to the Logical Data Structure (LDS) defined in [ICAODoc]) and
additionally providing the Extended Access Control according to the ‘ICAO Doc 9303’ [ICAODoc] and BSI TR-
03110 [TR-03110], respectively. The communication between terminal and chip shall be protected by


                                                     6 of 100

Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE) according to Electronic Passport using Standard
Inspection Procedure with PACE (PACE PP), BSI-CC-PP-0068-V2-2011-MA-01 [PP0068v2].
The TOE consists of
         the circuitry of the MRTD’s chip (the integrated circuit, IC) including the contact-based interface3
          with hardware for the contactless interface including contacts for the antenna,
         the platform – including the IC Dedicated Software and the IC Embedded Software, namely the Java
          Card operation system NXP JCOP 3 SECID P60 CS,
         NXP eDoc Suite v3.0 – cryptovision ePasslet Suite – Java Card applet configuration4 providing Ma-
          chine Readable Travel Document with „ICAO Application”, Extended Access Control with PACE,
         the associated guidance documentation Administrator and User Guidance [Guidance].
         All platform variants (e.g. with or without MIFARE functionality – see the following section) are only
          configuration/interface variants and are certified within one certification process (see [ZertJCOP].
          They are based on a certified cryptographic library [ZertCL] and a certified hardware [ZertIC].


The TOE’s functionality claimed by this Security Target is realized by the NXP eDoc Suite v3.0 – cryptovision
ePasslet Suite in the MRTD-EAC configuration only.

1.3.2.1    TOE identification and TOE variants
Some of the underlying platform variants5 of this composite TOE may provide MIFARE functionality or a
banking application in ROM; please note that this functionality is out of scope of the TOE’s security
functionality claimed by this security target.

The correctness of the chip and the existence of additional banking applet can be checked with the
corresponding custom mask identifier. The correct values are:

                                                    Custom mask ID
              without Banking applet                98AF436C0BAE9D93
              with MChip applet                     BC8ECAF99C6D53BA
              with CPA applet                       87C7A3ABD99C745F
              with VSCD applet                      13DF22D524EB6577


The custom mask identifier can be read with the GET DATA (Identify) command (see [UGM_JCOP]). The byte
values 49 to 56 of the response form the custom mask identifier.




3 Please note that the MRTD’s chip itself (the integrated circuit, IC) is also equipped with a contact-based
interface. ‘NXP eDoc Suite v3.0 – cryptovision ePasslet Suite – Java Card applet configuration providing Ma-
chine Readable Travel Document with „ICAO Application”, Extended Access Control with PACE’, is the only
application that has access to the contactless interface.
4The term “configuration” is used for the different instantiated applets of the NXP eDoc Suite and the files
and keys with its access conditions, created before the operational use stage.
5 The term „variant“ is used here for the commercial product types with differing additional functionality
available by NXP. In contrast, the term „configuration“ is used for the different possibilities to instantiate
the NXP eDoc Suite regarding instantiated applets, file system and objects (e.g. keys).

The different variants of the TOE can be referenced by its short name, which contains only a part of the
commercial product name and has the following form:

        Jxyeeec

The TOE can be identified following the instructions in [NXP-AN].

There are also different commercial variants available that differ regarding additional functionality of the
chip which is not part of the TOE. The TOE can be configured to include Neurotechnology MoC (Match-on-
Card) functionality and with two different EEPROM sizes. Additionly, the TOE is available without or in three
variants with different banking applets, and in variants without or with MIFARE option. The commercial
product names of the NXP products have the following form:

1.3.3 TOE usage and security features for operational use
This paragraph is directly based on the corresponding paragraph in the protection profile [PP0056v2].
A State or Organisation issues travel documents to be used by the holder for international travel. The trav-
eller presents a travel document to the inspection system to prove his or her identity. The travel document
in context of this security target contains (i) visual (eye readable) biographical data and portrait of the
holder, (ii) a separate data summary (MRZ data) for visual and machine reading using OCR methods in the
Machine readable zone (MRZ) and (iii) data elements on the travel document’s chip according to LDS in case
of contactless machine reading. The authentication of the traveller is based on (i) the possession of a valid
travel document personalised for a holder with the claimed identity as given on the biographical data page
and (ii) biometrics using the reference data stored in the travel document. The issuing State or Organisation

NXP eDoc Suite v3.0 - cryptovision ePasslet Suite / PP0056v2 based Security Target Lite


ensures the authenticity of the data of genuine travel documents. The receiving State trusts a genuine travel
document of an issuing State or Organisation.
For this security target the travel document is viewed as unit of
    (i) the physical part of the travel document in form of paper and/or plastic and chip. It presents vis-
         ual readable data including (but not limited to) personal data of the travel document holder
             (a) the biographical data on the biographical data page of the travel document surface,
             (b) the printed data in the Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) and
             (c) the printed portrait.
    (ii) the logical travel document as data of the travel document holder stored according to the Logical
         Data Structure as defined in [ICAODoc] as specified by ICAO on the contact based or contactless
         integrated circuit. It presents contact based / contactless readable data including (but not limited
         to) personal data of the travel document holder
             (a) the digital Machine Readable Zone Data (digital MRZ data, EF.DG1),
             (b) the digitized portraits (EF.DG2),
             (c) the biometric reference data of finger(s) (EF.DG3) or iris image(s) (EF.DG4) or both1
             (d) the other data according to LDS (EF.DG5 to EF.DG16) and
             (e) the Document Security Object (SOD).

The issuing State or Organisation implements security features of the travel document to maintain the au-
thenticity and integrity of the travel document and their data. The physical part of the travel document and
the travel document’s chip are identified by the Document Number.
The physical part of the travel document is protected by physical security measures (e.g. watermark, secu-
rity printing), logical (e.g. authentication keys of the travel document’s chip) and organisational security
measures (e.g. control of materials, personalisation procedures) [ICAODoc]. These security measures can
include the binding of the travel document’s chip to the travel document.
The logical travel document is protected in authenticity and integrity by a digital signature created by the
document signer acting for the issuing State or Organisation and the security features of the travel docu-
ment’s chip.
The ICAO defines the baseline security methods Passive Authentication and the optional advanced security
methods Basic Access Control to the logical travel document, Active Authentication of the travel document’s
chip, Extended Access Control to and the Data Encryption of sensitive biometrics as optional security meas-
ure in the ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAODoc], and Password Authenticated Connection Establishment [ICAO_SAC].
The Passive Authentication Mechanism is performed completely and independently of the TOE by the TOE
environment.
This security target addresses the protection of the logical travel document (i) in integrity by write-only-
once access control and by physical means, and (ii) in confidentiality by the Extended Access Control Mech-
anism. This security target addresses the Chip Authentication Version 1 described in [TR-03110] as an alter-
native to the Active Authentication stated in [ICAODoc].
If BAC is supported by the TOE, the travel document has to be evaluated and certified separately. This is
due to the fact that [PP0055] does only consider extended basic attack potential to the Basic Access Control
Mechanism (i.e. AVA_VAN.3).
The confidentiality by Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE) is a mandatory security
feature of the TOE. The travel document shall strictly conform to the ‘Common Criteria Protection Profile
Machine Readable Travel Document using Standard Inspection Procedure with PACE (PACE PP)’ [PP0068v2].
Note that [PP0068v2] considers high attack potential.
For the PACE protocol according to [ICAO_SAC], the following steps shall be performed:

    (i)         the travel document's chip encrypts a nonce with the shared password, derived from the MRZ
                resp. CAN data and transmits the encrypted nonce together with the domain parameters to
                the terminal.
    (ii)        The terminal recovers the nonce using the shared password, by (physically) reading the MRZ
                resp. CAN data.
    (iii)       The travel document's chip and terminal computer perform a EC-Diffie-Hellmann key agree-
                ment together with the ephemeral domain parameters to create a shared secret. Both parties
                derive the session keys KMAC and KENC from the shared secret.
    (iv)        Each party generates an authentication token, sends it to the other party and verifies the re-
                ceived token.

After successful key negotiation the terminal and the travel document's chip provide private communica-
tion (secure messaging) [TR-03110], [ICAO_SAC].
The protection profile requires the TOE to implement the Extended Access Control as defined in [TR-03110].
The Extended Access Control consists of two parts (i) the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1 and (ii) the
Terminal Authentication Protocol Version 1 (v.1). The Chip Authentication Protocol v.1 (i) authenticates the
travel document’s chip to the inspectionsystem and (ii) establishes secure messaging which is used by Ter-
minal Authentication v.1 to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the sensitive biometric reference
data during their transmission from the TOE to the inspection system. Therefore Terminal Authentication
v.1 can only be performed if Chip Authentication v.1 has been successfully executed. The Terminal Authen-
tication Protocol v.1 consists of (i) the authentication of the inspection system as entity authorized by the
receiving State or Organisation through the issuing State, and (ii) an access control by the TOE to allow
reading the sensitive biometric reference data only to successfully authenticated authorized inspection sys-
tems. The issuing State or Organisation authorizes the receiving State by means of certification the authen-
tication public keys of Document Verifiers who create Inspection System Certificates.

1.3.4 Major security features of the TOE
The TOE provides the following TOE security functionalities:
           TSF_Access manages the access to objects (files, directories, data and secrets) stored in the applet’s
            file system. It also controls write access of initialization, pre-personalization and personalization
            data.
           TSF_Admin manages the storage of manufacturing data, pre-personalization data and personaliza-
            tion data.
           TSF_Secret ensures secure management of secrets such as cryptographic keys. This covers secure
            key storage, access to keys as well as secure key deletion. These mechanisms are mainly provided
            by TSF_OS.
           TSF_Crypto performs high level cryptographic operations. The implementation is mainly based on
            the Security Functionalities provided by TSF_OS. The main supported crypto mechanisms are:
                o   hashing with SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512,
                o   Diffie-Hellman (DH) key derivation protocol compliant with PKCS#3 and TR-03110, and EC-
                    Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key derivation protocol compliant with ISO 15946 with cryptographic
                    key sizes of 160, 192, 224, 256, 320, 384, 512 and 521 bit with specific elliptic curves (do-
                    main parameters) for Chip Authentication
                o   digital signature verification with ECDSA and cryptographic key sizes of 160, 192, 224, 256,
                    320, 384, 512 and 521 bit with specified curves, and RSA and cryptographic key sizes be-
                    tween 2048 bit and 4096 bit,



                                                      10 of 100
NXP eDoc Suite v3.0 - cryptovision ePasslet Suite / PP0056v2 based Security Target Lite


              o   digital signature generation for the optional Active Authentication in accordance with RSA
                  and cryptographic key sizes between 2048 bit and 4096 bit,
              o   encryption and decryption with AES and cryptographic key sizes 128, 192, 256 bit,
              o   encryption and decryption with 3DES and cryptographic key sizes 112 bit,

              o   AES CMAC and cryptographic key sizes of 128, 192, 256 bit,
              o   Retail-MAC with cryptographic key size of 112 bit (based on 3DES),
              o   ECDH compliant to ISO 15946 with cryptographic key sizes of 160, 192, 224, 256, 320, 384,
                  512 and 521 bit used for PACE, and
              o   PACE Authentication.

         TSF_SecureMessaging realizes a secure communication channel with MACs and encryption based
          on AES (128, 192 or 256 bit key length) or 3DES (112 bit).
         TSF_Auth realizes different authentication mechanisms: TSF_Auth_PACE (key lengths 160, 192, 224,
          256, 320, 384, 512 and 521 bit bit), TSF_Auth_Term (Terminal Authentication), TSF_Auth_Sym with
          AES used for personalization and TSF_Auth_Chip to manage the capability of the TOE to authenti-
          cate itself to the terminal using the Chip Authentication Protocol.
         TSF_Integrity protects the integrity of internal applet data like the Access control lists.
         TSF_OS contains all security functionalities provided by the certified platform (IC, crypto library,
          Javacard operation system). Besides some minor additions, the cryptographic operations are pro-
          vided by this platform.

1.3.5     TOE life cycle
The TOE life cycle is described in terms of the four life cycle phases. This paragraph is directly based on the
corresponding paragraph in the protection profile [PP0056v2]; instead of the terms “ePassport” and “travel
document” used in [PP0056v2] the akronym “MRTD” is used uniformly here.

1.3.5.1    Phase 1: Development
(Step 1) The TOE is developed in phase 1. The IC developer develops the integrated circuit, the IC Dedicated
Software and the guidance documentation associated with these TOE components.
(Step 2) The software developer6 uses the guidance documentation for the integrated circuit and the guid-
ance documentation for relevant parts of the IC Dedicated Software and develops the IC Embedded Soft-
ware (operating system), the MRTD application and the guidance documentation associated with these TOE
components.
The manufacturing documentation of the IC including the IC Dedicated Software and the Embedded Soft-
ware in the non-volatile non-programmable memories (ROM) is securely delivered to the IC manufacturer.
The IC Embedded Software in the nonvolatile programmable memories, the MRTD application, the initiali-
sation data and the guidance documentation is securely delivered to the MRTD manufacturer.

1.3.5.2    Phase 2: Manufacturing
(Step 3) In a first step the TOE integrated circuit is produced containing the MRTD’s chip Dedicated Software
and the parts of the MRTD’s chip Embedded Software in the nonvolatile non-programmable memories



6Please note that in this ST the role software developer of the protection profile is subdivided into two
separate roles: the operating system is developed by the OS software developer, and the MRTD application
by the (MRTD) software developer.

                                                     11 of 100

(ROM). The IC manufacturer writes the IC Identification Data onto the chip to control the IC as MRTD mate-
rial during the IC manufacturing and the delivery process to the MRTD manufacturer. The IC is securely
delivered from the IC manufacturer to the MRTD manufacturer.
The TOE delivery according to CC is the delivery of the IC (with the application code in ROM) from the IC
manufacturer to the MRTD manufacturer.
If necessary the IC manufacturer adds the parts of the IC Embedded Software in the non-volatile program-
mable memories (for instance EEPROM).
(Step4 optional) The MRTD manufacturer combines the IC with hardware for the contact based / contactless
interface in the MRTD unless the travel document consists of the card only.
(Step5) The MRTD manufacturer (i) adds the IC Embedded Software or part of it in the non-volatile pro-
grammable memories (for instance EEPROM or FLASH) if necessary, (ii) creates the ePassport application,
and (iii) equips the MRTD’s chips with pre-personalization Data.
PP application note1: Creation of the application implies applet instantiation.7
In this step the final (but not yet personalized) MRTD is generated from the certified components accord-
ing to the binding initialization and pre-personalization guidelines provided in [Guidance].
The pre-personalized MRTD together with the IC Identifier is securely delivered fromthe MRTD manufac-
turer to the Personalization Agent. The MRTD manufacturer also provides the relevant parts of the guidance
documentation to the Personalization Agent.

1.3.5.3   Phase 3: Personalisation of the MRTD
(Step 6) The personalization of the MRTD includes (i) the survey of the MRTD holder biographical data, (ii)
the enrolment of the MRTD holder biometric reference data (i.e. the digitized portraits and the optional
biometric reference data), (iii) the printing of the visual readable data onto the physical MRTD and their
secure transfer to the personalisation agent, (iv) the writing of the TOE User Data and TSF Data into the
logical MRTD and (v) the writing the TSF Data into the logical MRTD and configuration of the TSF if necessary.
The step (iv) is performed by the Personalisation Agent and includes but is not limited to the creation of (i)
the digital MRZ data (DG1), (ii) the digitised portrait (DG2), and (iii) the Document security object.
The signing of the Document security object by the Document signer [ICAODoc] finalizes the personalization
of the genuine MRTD for the MRTD holder. The personalized MRTD (together with appropriate guidance
for TOE use if necessary) is handed over to the MRTD holder for operational use.
PP and PP0068v2 application note 2:The TSF data (data created by and for the TOE, that might affect the
operation of the TOE) comprise the Personalisation Agent Authentication Key(s), the Terminal Authentica-
tion trust anchor, the effective date and the Chip Authentication Private Key.
PP and PP0068v2 application note 3: This ST distinguishes between the Personalisation Agent as entity
known to the TOE and the Document Signer as entity in the TOE IT environment signing the Document
security object as described in [ICAODoc]. This approach allows but does not enforce the separation of these
roles.

1.3.5.4   Phase 4: Operational use
(Step 7) The TOE is used as MRTD’s chip by the traveller and the inspection systems in the “Operational
Use” phase. The user data can be read according to the security policy of the Issuing State or Organization
and used according to the security policy of the Issuing State but they can never be modified.
PP and PP0068v2 application note 4:The intention of the underlying PP [PP0056v2] is to consider at least
the phases 1 and parts of phase 2 (i.e. Step1 to Step3) as part of the evaluation and therefore to define the
TOE delivery according to CC after this phase. Since specific production steps of phase 2 are of minor security
relevance (e. g. booklet manufacturing and antenna integration) these are not part of the CC evaluation

PP0056v2 and PP0068v2 application note 1.

under ALC. Nevertheless the decision about this has to be taken by the certification body resp. the national
body of the issuing State or Organization. In this case the national body of the issuing State or Organization
is responsible for these specific production steps.
Note that the personalization process and its environment may depend on specific security needs of an
issuing State or Organization. All production, generation and installation procedures after TOE delivery up
to the “Operational Use” (phase 4) have to be considered in the product evaluation process under AGD
assurance class.
Some production steps, e.g. Step 4 in Phase 2 may also take place in the Phase 3.
Remark: This ST considers only phase 1 and parts of phase 2 (steps 1 - 3) as part of CC evaluation under ALC.

1.3.6 Non-TOE hardware/software/firmware required by the TOE
There is no explicit non-TOE hardware, software or firmware required by the TOE to perform its claimed
security features. The TOE is defined to comprise the chip and the complete operating system and applica-
tion. Note, the inlay holding the chip as well as the antenna and the booklet (holding the printed MRZ) are
needed to represent a complete MRTD, nevertheless these parts are not inevitable for the secure operation
of the TOE.
PP0068v2 application note 5:A terminal shall always start a communication session using PACE. If success-
fully, it should then proceed with passive authentications. If the trial with PACE failed, the terminal may try
to establish a communication session using other valid options as described above.

2.3.5 Assessment of Platform Organisational Security Policies
The platform ST contains the Organisational Security Policy “OSP.PROCESS-TOE” referring to accurate iden-
tification of each TOE instance. This policy will be fulfilled by a distinct product code for the platform and
for the composite TOE each. This policy does not contradict to the policies of this ST.
The Organisational Security Policy “OSP.VERIFICATION” focuses on the integrity of loaded applets, which is
fulfilled by the TOE of this ST since the applet is loaded from ROM only. This policy does not contradict to
the policies of this ST.
The Organisational Security Policy “OSP.KEY-CHANGE” states that initial security domain keys (APSD) shall
be changed before any operation on its Security Domain. This policy does not contradict to the policies of
this ST.
The Organisational Security Policy “OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS” states that security domains can be dynami-
cally created, deleted and blocked during usage phase in post-issuance mode. This policy does not contra-
dict to the policies of this ST.
The Organisational Security Policy “OSP.SECURE-BOX” focuses on the secure box mechanism, which is not
used by the TOE. This policy does not contradict to the policies of this ST.

Platform Assumption                    Relevance for Composite ST
A.APPLET                               A.APPLET states that applets loaded post-issuance do not contain na-
                                       tive methods. This assumption leads to appropriate directives in the
                                       user guidance [Guidance].
A.VERIFICATION                         This assumption targets the applet code verification. In the context of
                                       this ST the TOE is loaded from ROM only and was verified before ROM
                                       mask production. Regarding post-issuance loading of third party ap-
                                       plets, this assumption leads to appropriate directives in the user guid-
                                       ance [Guidance].
A.USE_DIAG                             A.USE_DIAG is required in the Platform ST to cover secure communi-
                                       cation during packaging, finishing and personalisation. This is corre-
                                       sponding to OT.Data_Confidentiality of this composite ST.
A.USE_KEYS                             A.USE_KEYS assumes that that the keys which are stored outside the
                                       TOE and which are used for secure communication and authentica-
                                       tion between Smart Card and terminals are protected for confidenti-
                                       ality and integrity in their own storage environment.
                                       This assumption leads to appropriate directives in the user guidance
                                       [Guidance].
A.PPROCESS-SEC-IC                      This assumption focuses on the security of the production process af-
                                       ter chip delivery; this is also targeted by P.Pre-Operational of this ST
                                       and leads to appropriate directives in the user guidance [Guidance].
                                       A.PPROCESS-SEC-IC of the platform ST states that it is assumed that
                                       security procedures are used after delivery of the TOE by the TOE
                                       Manufacturer up to delivery to the end consumer to maintain confi-
                                       dentiality and integrity of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test
                                       data (to prevent any possible copy, modification, retention, theft or
                                       unauthorised use). This means that the Phases after TOE Delivery are
                                       assumed to be protected appropriately. The assets to be protected
                                       are:
                                       - the Security IC Embedded Software including specifications, imple-
                                       mentation and related documentation,
                                       - pre-personalisation and personalisation data including specifications
                                       of formats and memory areas, test related data,
                                       - the User Data and related documentation, and
                                       - material for software development support
                                       as long as they are not under the control of the TOE Manufacturer.
                                       For the TOE of this ST, the Security IC Embedded Software is inte-
                                       grated in the ROM by the manufacturer of the platform. Thus, it is
                                       under control of the platform manufacturer. The protection of pre-
                                       personalisation and personalisation data as well as User Data is cor-
                                       responding to the Organizational Security Policies (OSP) P.Manufact
                                       and P.Personalisation.
                                       Thus, the main aspects of A.PPROCESS-SEC-IC are also addressed in
                                       this ST, and there are no contradictions in the assumptions.

 A.APPS-PROVIDER                       This assumption states that the entity that issues the application is a
                                       trusted actor that provides basic or secure applications. The entity is
                                       responsible for his security domain keys (APSD keys).
                                       This leads to appropriate directives in the user guidance [Guidance].
 A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY              This assumption focuses on the verification authority for digital sig-
                                       natures attached to a basic or secure application. This is reflected by
                                       appropriate directives in the user guidance [Guidance].

 OE.APPLET                                                  The platform objective for the environment states
                                                            that applets loaded post-issuance do not contain
                                                            native methods. This objective for the environ-

3         Security problem definition
This chapter has been taken from [PP0056v2] and [PP0068v2] with only minor modifications.


3.1 Introduction

3.1.1 Assets
The assets to be protected by the TOE include the User Data on the travel document’s chip, user data trans-
ferred between the TOE and the terminal, and travel document tracing data from the claimed PACE PP
[PP0068v2], chap 3.1.
PP0068v2 application note 6: Please note that user data being referred to in [PP0068v2] include, amongst
other, individual-related (personal) data of the travel document holder which also include his sensitive (i.e.
biometric) data. Hence, the general security policy also secures these specific travel document holder’s data
as stated in the table above.
PP0068v2 application note 7: Since the travel document does not support any secret travel document hold-
erauthentication data and the latter may reveal, if necessary, his or her verification values of the PACE pass-
word to an authorised person or device, a successful PACE authentication of a terminal does not unambig-
uously mean that the travel document holder is using TOE.
PP0068v2 application note 8: Travel document communication establishment authorisation data are rep-
resented by two different entities: (i) reference information being persistently stored in the TOE and (ii)
verification information being provided as input for the TOE by a human user as an authorisation attempt.
The TOE shall secure the reference information as well as – together with the terminal connected– the
verification information in the ‘TOE ↔ terminal’ channel, if it has to be transferred to the TOE. Please note
that PACE passwords are not to be send to the TOE.

3.1.1.1    Logical MRTD sensitive User Data
Sensitive biometric reference data (EF.DG3, EF.DG4).
PP application note5: Due to interoperability reasons the ‘ICAO Doc 9303’ [ICAODoc] requires that Basic
Inspection Systems may have access to logical travel document data DG1, DG2, DG5 to DG16. The TOE is
not in certified mode, if it is accessed using BAC [ICAODoc]. Note that the BAC mechanism cannot resist
attacks with high attack potential (cf. [PP0055]). If supported, it is therefore recommended to used PACE
instead of BAC. If nevertheless BAC has to be used, it is recommended to perform Chip Authentication v.1
before getting access to data (except DG14), as this mechanism is resistant to high potential attacks.
A sensitive asset is the following more general one.

3.1.1.2    Authenticity of the MRTD’s chip
The authenticity of the travel document’s chip personalised by the issuing State or Organisation for the
travel document holder is used by the traveller to prove his possession of a genuine travel document.
Due to strict conformance to PACE PP, this security target also includes all assets listed in [PP0068v2], chap
3.1, namely the primary assets user data stored on the TOE (object 1), user data transferred between the
TOE and the terminal connected (object 2), travel document tracing data (object 3), and the secondary
assets accessibility to the TOE functions and data only for authorised subjects (object 4) Genuineness of the
TOE (object 5), TOE intrinsic secret cryptographic keys (object 6), TOE intrinsic non secret cryptographic
material (object 7), and travel document communication establishment authorisation data (object 8). Due
to identical names and definitions these are not repeated here.

3.1.2 Subjects
This Security Targetconsiders the following subjects additionally to those defined in the PACE PP
[PP0068v2]:

3.1.2.1   Country Verifying Certification Authority
The Country Verifying Certification Authority (CVCA) enforces the privacy policy of the issuing State or Or-
ganization with respect to the protection of sensitive biometric reference data stored in the MRTD. The
CVCA represents the country specific root of the PKI of Inspection Systems and creates the Document Ver-
ifier Certificates within this PKI. The updates of the public key of the CVCA are distributed in the form of
Country Verifying CA Link-Certificates.

3.1.2.2   Document Verifier
The Document Verifier (DV) enforces the privacy policy of the receiving State with respect to the protection
of sensitive biometric reference data to be handled by the Extended Inspection Systems. The Document
Verifier manages the authorization of the Extended Inspection Systemsfor the sensitive data of the MRTD
in the limits provided by the issuing States or Organizations in the form of the Document Verifier Certifi-
cates.

3.1.2.3   Terminal
A terminal is any technical system communicating with the TOE through the contact interface or through
the contactless interface.

3.1.2.4   Inspection system (IS)
A technical system used by the border control officer of the receiving State (i) examining an travel document
presented by the traveller and verifying its authenticity and (ii) verifying the traveller as travel document
holder.
The Extended Inspection System (EIS) performs the Advanced Inspection Procedure and therefore (i) con-
tains a terminal for the communication with the travel document’s chip, (ii) implements the terminals part
of PACE and/or BAC; (iii) gets the authorization to read the logical travel document either under PACE or
BAC by optical reading the travel document providing this information. (iv) implements the Terminal Au-
thentication and Chip Authentication Protocols both Version 1 according to [5] and (v) is authorized by the
issuing State or Organisation through the Document Verifier of the receiving State to read the sensitive
biometric reference data. Security attributes of the EIS are defined by means of the Inspection System Cer-
tificates. BAC may only be used if supported by the TOE. If both PACE and BAC are supported by the TOE
and the BIS, PACE must be used.
PP Application note 6: For definition of Basic Inspection System (BIS) resp. Basic Inspection System with
PACE (BIS-PACE) see PACE PP [PP0068v2].

3.1.2.5   Attacker
Additionally to the definition from PACE PP [PP0068v2], chap 3.1 the definition of an attacker is refined as
followed: A threat agent trying (i) to manipulate the logical travel document without authorization, (ii) to
read sensitive biometric reference data (i.e. EF.DG3, EF.DG4), (iii) to forge a genuine travel document, or
(iv) to trace a travel document.
PP Application note 7: An impostor is attacking the inspection system as TOE IT environment independent
on using a genuine, counterfeit or forged travel document. Therefore the impostor may use results of suc-
cessful attacks against the TOE but the attack itself is not relevant for the TOE.
PP0068v2 application note 9: Since the TOE does not use BAC, a Basic Inspection System with BAC (BIS-
BAC) cannot be recognised by the TOE.

This ST includes all subjects from the PACE Protection Profile [PP0068v2], chap 3.1, namely Manufacturer,
Personalisation Agent, Basic Inspection System (with PACE), Document Signer (DS), and Country Signing
Certification Authority (CSCA), Travel Document Holder and Travel Document Presenter (traveller). Due to
identical definitions and names they are not repeated here.


3.2 Assumptions
The assumptions describe the security aspects of the environment in which the TOE will be used or is in-
tended to be used.

3.2.1 A.Insp_Sys Inspection Systems for global interoperability
The Extended Inspection System (EIS) for global interoperability (i) includes the Country Signing CA Public
Key and (ii) implements the terminal part of PACE [ICAO_SAC] and/or BAC [PP0055]. BAC may only be used
if supported by the TOE. If both PACE and BAC are supported by the TOE and the IS, PACE must be used.
The EIS reads the logical travel document under PACE or BAC and performs the Chip Authentication v.1 to
verify the logical travel document and establishes secure messaging. EIS supports the Terminal Authentica-
tion Protocol v.1 in order to ensure access control and is authorized by the issuing State or Organisation
through the Document Verifier of the receiving State to read the sensitive biometric reference data.
Justification: The assumption A.Insp_Sys does not confine the security objectives of the [PP0068v2] as it
repeats the requirements of P.Terminal and adds only assumptions for the Inspection Systems for handling
the the EAC functionality of the TOE.

3.2.2 A.Auth_PKI PKI for Inspection Systems
The issuing and receiving States or Organizations establish a public key infrastructure for card verifiable
certificates of the Extended Access Control. The Country Verifying Certification Authorities, the Document
Verifier and Extended Inspection Systems hold authentication key pairs and certificates for their public keys
encoding the access control rights. The Country Verifying Certification Authorities of the issuing States or
Organizations are signing the certificates of the Document Verifier and the Document Verifiers are signing
the certificates of the Extended Inspection Systems of the receiving States or Organizations. The issuing
States or Organizations distribute the public keys of their Country Verifying Certification Authority to their
MRTD’s chip.


This ST includes the assumption from the PACE PP [PP0068v2], chap 3.4, namely A.Passive_Auth.


3.3 Threats
This section describes the threats to be averted by the TOE independently or in collaboration with its IT
environment. These threats result from the TOE method of use in the operational environment and the
assets stored in or protected by the TOE.
The TOE in collaboration with its IT environment shall avert the threats as specified below.

3.3.1 T.Read_Sensitive_Data Read the sensitive biometric reference data
Adverse action:          An attacker tries to gain the sensitive biometric reference data through the com-
                         munication interface of the travel document’s chip.
                         The attack T.Read_Sensitive_Data is similar to the threat T.Skimming (cf. [PP0055])
                         in respect of the attack path (communication interface) and the motivation (to get
                         data stored on the travel document’s chip) but differs from those in the asset under


                                                     33 of 100
NXP eDoc Suite v3.0 - cryptovision ePasslet Suite / PP0056v2 based Security Target Lite


                         the attack (sensitive biometric reference data vs. digital MRZ, digitized portrait and
                         other data), the opportunity (i.e. knowing the PACE Password) and therefore the
                         possible attack methods. Note, that the sensitive biometric reference data are
                         stored only on the travel document’s chip as private sensitive personal data
                         whereas the MRZ data and the portrait are visually readable on the physical part of
                         the travel document as well.
Threat agent:            having high attack potential, knowing the PACE Password, being in possession of a
                         legitimate travel document
Asset:                   confidentiality of logical travel document sensitive user data (i.e. biometric refer-
                         ence)

3.3.2 T.Counterfeit MRTD’s chip
Adverse action:          An attacker with high attack potential produces an unauthorized copy orreproduc-
                         tion of a genuine MRTD’s chip to be used as part of a counterfeit MRTD. This violates
                         the authenticity of the MRTD’s chip used for authentication of a traveler by posses-
                         sion of a MRTD.
                         The attacker may generate a new data set or extract completely or partially the data
                         from a genuine MRTD’s chip and copy them on another appropriate chip to imitate
                         this genuine MRTD’s chip.
Threat agent:            having high attack potential, being in possession of one or more legitimate MRTDs
Asset:                   authenticity of user data stored on the TOE



This ST includes all threats from the PACE PP [PP0068v2], chap 3.2, namely T.Skimming, T.Eavesdropping,
T.Tracing, T.Abuse-Func, T.Information_Leakage, T.Phys-Tamper, and T.Malfunction. Due to identical defi-
nitions and names they are not repeated here as well.


PP0068v2 application notes 10 – 19:<informational only>


PP Application note 8: T.Forgery from the PACE PP [PP0068v2] is extended by the Extended Inspection
System additionally to the PACE authenticated BIS-PACE being outsmarted by the attacker.

3.3.3 T.Forgery          Forgery of Data
Adverse action:          An attacker fraudulently alters the User Data or/and TSF-data stored on the travel
                         documentor/andexchanged between the TOE and the terminal connectedin or-
                         derto outsmart the PACE authenticated BIS-PACE or the Extended Inspection Sys-
                         tem by means of changedtraveldocumentholder’s related reference data (like bi-
                         ographicor biometric data).The attacker does it in such a way that the terminal con-
                         nected perceives these modified data as authentic one.
Threat agent:            having high attack potential
Asset:                   integrity of the travel document

3.4 Organizational security policies
The TOE shall comply with the following Organizational Security Policies (OSP) as security rules, procedures,
practices, or guidelines imposed by an organization upon its operations (see CCpart 1 [CC_1], section 3.2).

3.4.1 P.Sensitive_Data Privacy of sensitive biometric reference data
The biometric reference data of finger(s) (EF.DG3) and iris image(s) (EF.DG4) are sensitive private personal
data of the MRTD holder. The sensitive biometric reference data can be used only by inspection systems
which are authorized for this access at the time the MRTD is presented to the inspection system (Extended
Inspection Systems). The issuing State or Organization authorizes the Document Verifiers of the receiving
States to manage the authorization of inspection systems within the limits defined by the Document Verifier
Certificate. The MRTD’s chip shall protect the confidentiality and integrity of the sensitive private personal
data even during transmission to the Extended Inspection System after Chip Authentication Version 1.

3.4.2 P.Personalization Personalization of the MRTD by issuing State or Organization only
The issuing State or Organization guarantees the correctness of the biographical data, the printed portrait
and the digitized portrait, the biometric reference data and other data of the logical MRTD with respect to
the MRTD holder. The personalization of the MRTD for the holder is performed by an agent authorized by
the issuing State or Organization only.


This ST includes all OSPs from the PACE PP [PP0068v2], chap 3.3, namely P.Pre-Operational, P.Card_PKI,
P.Trustworthy_PKI, P.Manufact and P.Terminal. Due to identical definitions and names they are also not
repeated here.

4 Security objectives
This chapter describes the security objectives for the TOE and the security objectives for the TOE environ-
ment. The security objectives for the TOE environment are separated into security objectives for the devel-
opment and production environment and security objectives for the operational environment.


4.1 Security Objectives for the TOE
This section describes the security objectives for the TOE addressing the aspects of identified threats to be
countered by the TOE and organizational security policies to be met by the TOE.

4.1.1 OT.Sens_Data_Conf Confidentiality of sensitive biometric reference data
The TOE must ensure the confidentiality of the sensitive biometric reference data (EF.DG3 andEF.DG4) by
granting read access only to authorized Extended Inspection Systems. The authorization of the inspection
system is drawn from the Inspection System Certificate used forthe successful authentication and shall be
a non-strict subset of the authorization defined in theDocument Verifier Certificate in the certificate chain
to the Country Verifier Certification Authority of the issuing State or Organization. The TOE must ensure the
confidentiality of the logical MRTD data during their transmission to the Extended Inspection System. The
confidentiality of the sensitive biometric reference data shall be protected against attacks withhigh attack
potential.

4.1.2 OT.Chip_Auth_Proof Proof of MRTD’s chip authenticity
The TOE must support the General Inspection Systems to verify the identity and authenticity ofthe MRTD’s
chip as issued by the identified issuing State or Organization by means of the Chip Authentication as defined
in [TR-03110]. The authenticity proof provided by MRTD’s chip shall be protected against attacks with high
attack potential.
PP application note 9: The OT.Chip_Auth_Proof implies the MRTD’s chip to have (i) a unique identity as
given by the MRTD’s Document Number, (ii) a secret to prove its identity by knowledge i.e. a private au-
thentication key as TSF data. The TOE shall protect this TSF data to prevent their misuse. The terminal shall
have the reference data to verify the authentication attempt of MRTD’s chip i.e. a certificate for the Chip
Authentication Public Key that matches the Chip Authentication Private Key of the MRTD’s chip. This certif-
icate is provided by (i) the Chip Authentication Public Key (EF.DG14) in the LDS [ICAODoc] and (ii) the hash
value of the Chip Authentication Public Key in the Document Security Object signed by the Document Signer.


This ST includes all Security Objectives for the TOE from the PACE PP [PP0068v2], chap 4.1, namely
OT.Data_Integrity, OT.Data_Authenticity, OT.Data_Confidentiality, OT.Tracing, OT.Prot_Abuse-Func,
OT.Prof_Inf_Leak, OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper, OT.Identification, OT.AC_Pers and OT.Prot_Malfunction. Due to
identical definitions and names they are not repeated here as well.


PP0068v2 application notes 21 – 23: <informational only>
The following Security Objective for the TOE is defined in addition to the objectives given by the Protection
Profiles to cover the Active Authentication mechanism.

4.1.3 OT.Active_Auth_Proof Proof of travel document’s chip authenticity
The TOE shall support the Basic Inspection Systems to verify the identity and authenticity of the travel doc-
ument’s chip as issued by the identified issuing State or Organisation by means of the Active Authentication

NXP eDoc Suite v3.0 - cryptovision ePasslet Suite / PP0056v2 based Security Target Lite


as defined in [ICAODoc]. The authenticity proof provided by travel document’s chip shall be protected
against attacks with high attack potential.


4.2 Security Objectives for the Operational Environment

4.2.1 Issuing State or Organization
The issuing State or Organization will implement the following security objectives of the TOE environment.

4.2.1.1   OE.Auth_Key_Travel_Document Travel document Authentication Key
The issuing State or Organisation has to establish the necessary public key infrastructure in order to (i) gen-
erate the travel document’s Chip Authentication Key Pair, (ii) sign and store the Chip Authentication Public
Key in the Chip Authentication Public Key data in EF.DG14 and (iii) support inspection systems of receiving
States or Organisations to verify the authenticity of the travel document’s chip used for genuine travel doc-
ument by certification of the Chip Authentication Public Key by means of the Document Security Object.
Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is needed additionally to those from
[PP0068v2] in order to counter the Threat T.Counterfeit as it specifies the pre-requisite for the Chip Authen-
tication Protocol Version 1 which is one of the additional features of the TOE described only in the Protec-
tion Profile [PP0056v2] and not in [PP0068v2].

4.2.1.2   OE.Authoriz_Sens_Data Authorization for Use of Sensitive Biometric Reference Data
The issuing State or Organisation has to establish the necessary public key infrastructure in order to limit
the access to sensitive biometric reference data of travel document holders to authorized receiving States
or Organisations. The Country Verifying Certification Authority of the issuing State or Organisation gener-
ates card verifiable Document Verifier Certificates for the authorized Document Verifier only.
Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is needed additionally to those from
[PP0068v2] in order to handle the Threat T.Read_Sensitive_Data, the Organisational Security Policy P.Sen-
sitive_Data and the Assumption A.Auth_PKI as it specifies the pre-requisite for the Terminal Authentication
Protocol v.1 as it concerns the need of an PKI for this protocol and the responsibilities of its root instance.
The Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 is one of the additional features of the TOE described only in the
Protection Profile [PP0056v2] and not in [PP0068v2].

4.2.2 Receiving State or Organization
The receiving State or Organization will implement the following security objectives of the TOE environ-
ment.

4.2.2.1   OE.Exam_Travel_Document Examination of the travel document passport book
The inspection system of the receiving State or Organisation must examine the travel document presented
by the traveller to verify its authenticity by means of the physical security measures and to detect any ma-
nipulation of the physical part of the travel document. The Basic Inspection System for global interoperabil-
ity (i) includes the Country Signing CA Public Key and the Document Signer Public Key of each issuing State
or Organisation, and (ii) implements the terminal part of PACE [ICAO_SAC] and/or the Basic Access Control
[6]. Extended Inspection Systems perform additionally to these points the Chip Authentication Protocol Ver-
sion 1 to verify the Authenticity of the presented travel document’s chip.
Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is needed additionally to those from
[PP0068v2] in order to handle the Threat T.Counterfeit and the Assumption A.Insp_Sys by demanding the
Inspection System to perform the Chip Authentication protocol v.1. OE.Exam_Travel_Document also re-
peats partly the requirements from OE.Terminal in [PP0068v2] and therefore also counters T.Forgery and
A.Passive_Auth from [PP0068v2]. This is done because a new type of Inspection System is introduced in the

                                                     37 of 100
NXP eDoc Suite v3.0 - cryptovision ePasslet Suite / PP0056v2 based Security Target Lite


protection profile [PP0056v2] as the Extended Inspection System is needed to handle the additional fea-
tures of a travel document with Extended Access Control.

4.2.2.2   OE.Prot_Logical_Travel_Document Protection of data from the logical travel document
The inspection system of the receiving State or Organisation ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the
data read from the logical travel document. The inspection system will prevent eavesdropping to their com-
munication with the TOE before secure messaging is successfully established based on the Chip Authenti-
cation Protocol Version 1.
Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is needed additionally to those from
[PP0068v2] in order to handle the Assumption A.Insp_Sys by requiring the Inspection System to perform
secure messaging based on the Chip Authentication Protocol v.1.

4.2.2.3   OE.Ext_Insp_Systems: Authorization of Extended Inspection Systems
The Document Verifier of receiving States or Organisations authorizes Extended Inspection Systems by cre-
ation of Inspection System Certificates for access to sensitive biometric reference data of the logical travel
document. The Extended Inspection System authenticates themselves to the travel document’s chip for
access to the sensitive biometric reference data with its private Terminal Authentication Key and its Inspec-
tion System Certificate.
Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is needed additionally to those from
[PP0068v2] in order to handle the Threat T.Read_Sensitive_Data, the Organisational Security Policy P.Sen-
sitive_Data and the Assumption A.Auth_PKI as it specifies the pre-requisite for the Terminal Authentication
Protocol v.1 as it concerns the responsibilities of the Document Verifier instance and the Inspection Sys-
tems.


This ST includes all Security Objectives of the TOE environment from the PACE PP [PP0068v2], chap. 4.2,
namely OE.Legislative_Compliance, OE.Passive_Auth_Sign, OE.Personalisation, OE.Terminal, and
OE.Travel_Document_Holder. Due to identical definitions and names they are not repeated here.
PP0068v2 application note 24: <informational only>


The following objective for the environment was added:

4.2.2.4   OE.Active_Auth_Key_MRTD:
The inspection system of the receiving State or Organisation must carry out Active Authentication to verify
the Authenticity of the presented travel document’s chip.
Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is needed additionally to those from
[PP0068v2]and [PP0056v2] in order to handle the Threat T.Counterfeit. It neither mitigates a threat meant
to be addressed by security objectives for the TOE – this is achieved by chip authentication alone - nor fulfils
an OSP meant to be addressed by security objectives for the TOE.



4.3 Security Objective Rationale
The following table provides an overview for security objectives coverage.

The OSP P.Personalisation “Personalisation of the travel document by issuing State or Organisation only”
addresses the (i) the enrolment of the logical travel document by the Personalisation Agent as described in
the security objective for the TOE environment OE.Personalisation “Personalisation of logical travel docu-
ment”, and (ii) the access control for the user data and TSF data as described by the security objective
OT.AC_Pers “Access Control for Personalisation of logical travel document”. Note the manufacturer equips
the TOE with the Personalisation Agent Key(s) according to OT.Identification “Identification and Authenti-
cation of the TOE”. The security objective OT.AC_Pers limits the management of TSF data and the manage-
ment of TSF to the Personalisation Agent.
The OSP P.Sensitive_Data “Privacy of sensitive biometric reference data” is fulfilled and the threat
T.Read_Sensitive_Data “Read the sensitive biometric reference data” is countered by the TOE-objective
OT.Sens_Data_Conf “Confidentiality of sensitive biometric reference data” requiring that read access to

8The Objectives marked in italic letters are included from the claimed PACE-PP [PP0068v2]. They are listed
for the complete overview of the security objectives.

EF.DG3 and EF.DG4 (containing the sensitive biometric reference data) is only granted to authorized inspec-
tion systems. Furthermore it is required that the transmission of these data ensures the data’s confidenti-
ality. The authorization bases on Document Verifier certificates issued by the issuing State or Organisation
as required by OE.Authoriz_Sens_Data “Authorization for use of sensitive biometric reference data”. The
Document Verifier of the receiving State has to authorize Extended Inspection Systems by creating appro-
priate Inspection System certificates for access to the sensitive biometric reference data as demanded by
OE.Ext_Insp_Systems “Authorization of Extended Inspection Systems”.
The OSP P.Terminal “Abilities and trustworthiness of terminals” is countered by the security objective
OE.Exam_Travel_Document additionally to the security objectives from PACE PP [PP0068v2].
OE.Exam_Travel_Document enforces the terminals to perform the terminal part of the PACE protocol.
The threat T.Counterfeit “Counterfeit of travel document chip data” addresses the attack of unauthorized
copy or reproduction of the genuine travel document's chip. This attack is thwarted by chip identification
and authenticity proof required by OT.Chip_Auth_Proof “Proof of travel document’s chip authentication”
using an authentication key pair to be generated by the issuing State or Organisation. The Public Chip Au-
thentication Key has to be written into EF.DG14 and signed by means of Documents Security Objects as
demanded by OE.Auth_Key_Travel_Document “Travel document Authentication Key”. According to
OE.Exam_Travel_Document “Examination of the physical part of the travel document” the General Inspec-
tion system has to perform the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1 to verify the authenticity of the travel
document’s chip.
The threat T.Forgery “Forgery of data” addresses the fraudulent, complete or partial alteration of the User
Data or/and TSF-data stored on the TOE or/and exchanged between the TOE and the terminal. Additionally
to the security objectives from PACE PP [PP0068v2] which counter this threat, the examination of the pre-
sented MRTD passport book according to OE.Exam_Travel_Document “Examination of the physical part of
the travel document” shall ensure its authenticity by means of the physical security measures and detect
any manipulation of the physical part of the travel document.
The examination of the travel document addressed by the assumption A.Insp_Sys “Inspection Systems for
global interoperability” is covered by the security objectives for the TOE environment
OE.Exam_Travel_Document “Examination of the physical part of the travel document” which requires the
inspection system to examine physically the travel document, the Basic Inspection System to implement
the Basic Access Control, and the Extended Inspection Systems to implement and to perform the Chip Au-
thentication Protocol Version 1 to verify the Authenticity of the presented travel document’s chip. The se-
curity objectives for the TOE environment OE.Prot_Logical_Travel_Document “Protection of data from the
logical travel document” require the Inspection System to protect the logical travel document data during
the transmission and the internal handling.
The assumption A.Passive_Auth “PKI for Passive Authentication” is directly covered by the security objec-
tive for the TOE environment OE.Passive_Auth_Sign “Authentication of travel document by Signature” from
PACE PP [PP0068v2] covering the necessary procedures for the Country Signing CA Key Pair and the Docu-
ment Signer Key Pairs. The implementation of the signature verification procedures is covered by
OE.Exam_Travel_Document “Examination of the physical part of the travel document”.
The assumption A.Auth_PKI “PKI for Inspection Systems” is covered by the security objective for the TOE
environment OE.Authorize_Sens_Data “Authorization for use of sensitive biometric reference data” re-
quires the CVCA to limit the read access to sensitive biometrics by issuing Document Verifier certificates for
authorized receiving States or Organisations only. The Document Verifier of the receiving State is required
by OE.Ext_Insp_Systems “Authorization of Extended Inspection Systems” to authorize Extended Inspection
Systems by creating Inspection System Certificates. Therefore, the receiving issuing State or Organisation
has to establish the necessary public key infrastructure.
In addition to the rationale given by the Protection Profiles, the threat T.Counterfeit“Conterfeit of travel
document’s chip data” is thwarted through the chip by anidentification and authenticity proof required by
OT.Active_Auth_Proof “Proof of travel document’s chip authentication” using an authentication key pair

to be generated by the issuing state or organisation. The Public Active Authentication Key has to be written
into EF.DG15 and signed by means of Documents Security Objects as demanded by
OE.Active_Auth_Key_MRTD “Travel Document ActiveAuthentication Key”.

5 Extended Components Definition
This security target uses components defined as extensions to CC part 2. Some of these components are
defined in [PP0068v2], other components are defined in the protection profile [PP0056v2].


5.1 Definition of the Family FIA_API
To describe the IT security functional requirements of the TOE a sensitive family (FIA_API) of the Class FIA
(Identification and authentication) is defined here. This family describes the functional requirements for the
proof of the claimed identity for the authentication verification by an external entity where the other fam-
ilies of the class FIA address the verification of the identity of an external entity.
PP application note 10: The other families of the Class FIA describe only the authentication verification of
users’ identity performed by the TOE and do not describe the functionality of the user to prove their iden-
tity. [PP0056v2] defines the family FIA_API in the style of [CC_2] from a TOE point of view.


FIA_API Authentication Proof of Identity
Family behavior
This family defines functions provided by the TOE to prove their identity and to be verified by anexternal
entity in the TOE IT environment.

Dependencies:            No dependencies.
FIA_API.1.1              The TSF shall provide a [assignment:authentication mechanism] to prove the iden-
                         tity of the [assignment: authorized user or role].


This ST includes all Extended Component Definitions from the PACE PP [PP0068v2], chap. 5, namely
FAU_SAS, FCS_RND, FMT_LIM, FPT_EMS. These definitions are taken over as described in [PP0068v2],
therefore they are not repeated here.

PP0068v2 application note 31: This SFR requires the TOE to generate random numbers (random nonce)
used for the authentication protocol (PACE) as required by FIA_UAU.4/PACE.


Developer note: The corresponding platform SFR (FCS_RNG.1) states that the platform provides a deter-
ministic random number generator (RNG) that fulfills the following:
   (DRG.3.1) If initialized with a random seed using a PTRNG of class PTG.2 (as defined in [AIS31]) as ran-
    dom source, the internal state of the RNG shall have at least 256 bit of entropy.
   (DRG.3.2) The RNG provides forward secrecy.
   (DRG.3.3) The RNG provides enhanced backward secrecy even if the current internal state is known.
   (DRG.3.4) The RNG, initialized with a random seed using a PTRNG of class PTG.2 (as defined in
    [AIS31]) as random source, generates output for which in AES mode 248 and in 3DES mode 235 strings
    of bit length 128 are mutually different with probability at least 1 - 224 in AES mode and 1 – 2-17 in
    3DES mode.
   (DRG.3.5) Statistical test suites cannot practically distinguish the random numbers from output se-
    quences of an ideal RNG. The random numbers must pass test procedure A (as defined in [AIS20]).

The PTG.2 is realized by the security chip hardware [ST_IC]. Thus the platform RNG implements AIS20
[AIS20] class DRG.3.

Note the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1 as defined in this security target includes
       the asymmetric key agreement to establish symmetric secure messaging keys between the TOE
        and the terminal based on the Chip Authentication Public Key and the Terminal Public Key used
        later in the Terminal Authentication Protocol Version 1,

         the check whether the TOE is able to generate the correct message authentication code with the
          expected key for any message received by the terminal.

The Chip Authentication Protocol v.1 may be used independent of the Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1.
But if the Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 is used the terminal shall use the same public key as pre-
sented during the Chip Authentication Protocol v.1.


The TOE shall meet the requirement “Timing of identification (FIA_UID.1)” as specified below (Common
Criteria Part 2).


FIA_AFL.1/PACE Authentication failure handling – PACE authentication using non-blocking authorisation
data
Hierarchical to:         No other components.
Dependencies:            FIA_UAU.1 Timing of authentication: fulfilled by FIA_UAU.1/PACE
FIA_AFL.1.1/PACE         The TSF shall detect when 1043 unsuccessful authentication attempt occurs related
                         to authentication attempts using the PACE password as shared password.
FIA_AFL.1.2/PACE         When the defined number of unsuccessful authentication attempts has been met,
                         the TSF shall delay each of the following authentication attempt until the next
                         successful authentication attempt by an increasing amount of time44.


PP0068v2 Application Note 32: The open assignment operation shall be performed according to a concrete
implementation of the TOE, whereby actions to be executed by the TOE may either be common for all data
concerned (PACE passwords, see [ICAO_SAC]) or for an arbitrary subset of them or may also separately be
defined for each datum in question. Since all non-blocking authorisation data (PACE passwords) being used
as a shared secret within the PACE protocol do not possess a sufficient entropy45, the TOE shall not allow a
quick monitoring of its behaviour (e.g. due to a long reaction time) in order to make the first step of the
skimming attack46 requiring an attack potential beyond high, so that the threat T.Tracing can be averted in
the frame of the security policy of this ST. One of some opportunities for performing this operation might
be ‘consecutively increase the reaction time of the TOE to the next authentication attempt using PACE pass-
words’.

PP Application note 30: This SFR requires the TOE to implement the Chip Authentication Mechanism v.1
specified in [TR-03110]. The TOE and the terminal generate a shared secret using the Diffie-Hellman Proto-
col (DH or EC-DH) and two session keys for secure messaging in ENC_MAC mode according to [ICAODoc].
The terminal verifies by means of secure messaging whether the travel document’s chip was able or not to
run his protocol properly using its Chip Authentication Private Key corresponding to the Chip Authentication
Key (EF.DG14).

Hierarchical to:          No other components.
Dependencies:             No dependencies.

                          Doc]47 to prove the identity of the TOE48.


Application Note: The SFR FIA_API.1/AA has been included inthis security target in addition to the SFRs
defined by the Protection Profiles claimed insection 2.2. This extension does not conflict with the strict
conformance to the claimed Protection Profiles.

                          1. to establish the communication channel,
                          2. carrying out the PACE Protocol according to [ICAO_SAC],

                          on behalf of the user to be performed before the user is identified.

                          other TSF-mediated actions on behalf of that user.


PP0068v2 application note 33: User identified after a successfully performed PACE protocol is a PACE au-
thenticated BIS-PACE. Please note that neither CAN nor MRZ effectively represent secrets (but other PACE

PP Application note 21: In the Phase 2 “Manufacturing of the TOE” the Manufacturer is the only user role
known to the TOE which writes the Initialization Data and/or Pre-personalisation Data in the audit records
of the IC. The travel document manufacturer may create the user role Personalisation Agent for transition
from Phase 2 to Phase 3 “Personalisation of the travel document”. The users in role Personalisation Agent
identify themselves by means of selecting the authentication key. After personalisation in the Phase 3 the
PACE domain parameters, the Chip Authentication data and Terminal Authentication Reference Data are
written into the TOE. The Inspection System is identified as default user after power up or reset of the TOE
i.e. the TOE will run the PACE protocol, to gain access to the Chip Authentication Reference Data and to run
the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1. After successful authentication of the chip the terminal may
identify itself as (i) Extended Inspection System by selection of the templates for the Terminal Authentica-
tion Protocol Version 1 or (ii) if necessary and available by authentication as Personalisation Agent (using
the Personalisation Agent Key).
PP Application note 22: User identified after a successfully performed PACE protocol is a terminal. Please
note that neither CAN nor MRZ effectively represent secrets, but are restricted revealable; i.e. it is either
the travel document holder itself or an authorised other person or device (Basic Inspection System with
PACE).
PP Application note 23: In the life-cycle phase ‘Manufacturing’ the Manufacturer is the only user role known
to the TOE. The Manufacturer writes the Initialisation Data and/or Pre-personalisation Data in the audit
records of the IC. Please note that a Personalisation Agent acts on behalf of the travel document Issuer
under his and CSCA and DS policies. Hence, they define authentication procedure(s) for Personalisation
Agents. The TOE must functionally support these authentication procedures being subject to evaluation
within the assurance components ALC_DEL.1 and AGD_PRE.1. The TOE assumes the user role ‘Personalisa-
tion Agent’, when a terminal proves the respective Terminal Authorisation Level as defined by the related
policy (policies).

                         rules:
                         1. Having successfully run the PACE protocol the TOE accepts only received
                            commands with correct message authentication code sent by means of se-
                            cure messaging with the key agreed with the terminal by means of the PACE
                            protocol.
                         2. The TOE accepts the authentication attempt as Personalisation Agent by Au-
                            thentication Mechanism with Personalization Agent Keys55.
                         3. After run of the Chip Authentication Protocol v. 1 the TOE accepts only re-
                            ceived commands with correct message authentication code sent by means
                            of secure messaging with key agreed with the terminal by means of the Chip
                            Authentication Mechanism v. 1.
                         4. The TOE accepts the authentication attempt by means of the Terminal Au-
                            thentication Protocol v.1 only if the terminal uses the public key presented
                            during the Chip Authentication Protocol v.1 and the secure messaging estab-

Hierarchical to:         No other components.

                         verified as being sent by the Inspection System.


PP application note 29: The Password Authenticated Connection Establishment and the Chip Authentica-
tion Protocol specified in [ICAODoc] include secure messaging for all commands exchanged after successful
authentication of the Inspection System. The TOE checks by secure messaging in MAC_ENC mode each
command based on a corresponding MAC algorithm whether it was sent by the successfully authenticated
terminal (see FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC for further details). The TOE does not execute any command with incor-
rect message authentication code. Therefore the TOE re-authenticates the user for each received command
and accepts only those commands received from the previously authenticated user.

PP0068v2 Application note 37:The PACE protocol specified in [ICAO-SAC] starts secure messaging used for
all commands exchanged after successful PACE authentication. The TOE checks each command by secure
messaging in encrypt-then-authenticate mode based on CMAC or Retail-MAC, whether it was sent by the
successfully authenticated terminal (see FCS_COP.1/PACE_MAC for further details). The TOE does not exe-
cute any command with incorrect message authentication code. Therefore, the TOE re-authenticates the
terminal connected, if a secure messaging error occurred, and accepts only those commands received from
the initially authenticated terminal.

                         exchange between the TOE and the Terminal.


PP0068v2 application note 43: The trusted IT product is the terminal. In FTP_ITC.1.3/PACE, the word “initi-
ate” is changed to ‘enforce”, as the TOE is a passive device that can not initiate the communication. All the
communication are initiated by the Terminal, and the TOE enforce the trusted channel.
PP0068v2 application note 44: The trusted channel is established after successful performing the PACE
protocol (FIA_UAU.1/PACE). If the PACE was successfully performed, secure messaging is immediately
started using the derived session keys (PACE-KMAC, PACE-KEnc): this secure messaging enforces preventing
tracing while Passive Authentication and the required properties of operational trusted channel; the cryp-
tographic primitives being used for the secure messaging are as required by FCS_COP.1/PACE_ENC and
FCS_COP.1/PACE_MAC. The establishing phase of the PACE trusted channel does not enable tracing due to
the requirements FIA_AFL.1/PACE.

PP0068v2 application note 46: The Manufacturer role is the default user identity assumed by the TOE in
the life cycle phase ‘manufacturing’. The IC manufacturer and the travel document manufacturer in the
Manufacturer role write the Initialisation and/or Pre-personalisation Data as TSF-data into the TOE. The
audit records are usually write-only-once data of the travel document (see FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA,

         ified as correct with the public key of the Country Verifying Certification Authority known to the
         TOE and the expiration date of the Certificate of the Country Verifying Certification Authority is
         not before the Current Date of the TOE.
The Inspection System Public Key contained in the Inspection System Certificate in a valid certificate chain
is a secure value for the authentication reference data of the Extended Inspection System.
The intersection of the Certificate Holder Authorizations contained in the certificates of a valid certificate
chain is a secure value for Terminal Authorization of a successful authenticated Extended Inspection Sys-
tem.
The intersection of the Certificate Holder Authorizations contained in the certificates of a valid certificate

6.2.7 Class FPT Protection of the Security Functions
The TOE shall prevent inherent and forced illicit information leakage for User Data and TSF Data. The secu-
rity functional requirement FPT_EMS.1 addresses the inherent leakage. With respect to the forced leakage
they have to be considered in combination with the security functional requirements “Failure with preser-
vation of secure state (FPT_FLS.1)” and “TSFtesting (FPT_TST.1)” on the one hand and “Resistance to phys-
ical attack (FPT_PHP.3)” on the other. The SFRs “Limited capabilities (FMT_LIM.1)”, “Limited availability
(FMT_LIM.2)” and“Resistance to physical attack (FPT_PHP.3)” together with the SAR “Security architecture-
description” (ADV_ARC.1) prevent bypassing, deactivation and manipulation of the security features or mis-
use of TOE security functionality.

PP application note 48: <applied>
PP0068v2 application note 51: The TOE shall prevent attacks against the listed secret data where the attack
is based on external observable physical phenomena of the TOE. Such attacks may be observable at the
interfaces of the TOE or may be originated from internal operation of the TOE or may be caused by an
attacker that varies the physical environment under which the TOE operates. The set of measurable physical
phenomena is influenced by the technology employed to implement the smart card. The travel document’s
chip has to provide a smart card contactless interface, but may have also (not used by the terminal, but
maybe by an attacker) sensitive contacts according to ISO/IEC7816-2 as well. Examples of measurable phe-
nomena include, but are not limited to variations in the power consumption, the timing of signals and the
electromagnetic radiation due to internal operations or data transmissions.

FPT_FLS.1.1                 The TSF shall preserve a secure state when the following types of failures occur:
                            1. Exposure to out-of-range operating conditions where therefore a malfunction
                            could occur,
                            2. Failure detected by TSF according to FPT_TST.1.

Dependencies:               No Dependencies.
FPT_TST.1.1                 The TSF shall run a suite of self tests during initial start-up77 to demonstrate the
                            correct operation of the TSF.
FPT_TST.1.2                 The TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to verify the integrity of
                            TSF data.
FPT_TST.1.3                 The TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to verify the integrity of
                            stored TSF executable code.


PP0068v2 application note 52: If the travel document’s chip uses state of the art smart card technology, it
will run some self tests at the request of an authorised user and some self tests automatically. E.g. a self
test for the verification of the integrity of stored TSF executable code required by FPT_TST.1.3 may be exe-
cuted during initial start-up by the ‘authorised user’ Manufacturer in the life cycle phase ‘Manufacturing’.
Other self tests may automatically run to detect failures and to preserve the secure state according to
FPT_FLS.1 in the phase ‘operational use’, e.g. to check a calculation with aprivate key by the reverse calcu-
lation with the corresponding public key as a countermeasure against Differential Failure Analysis.


FPT_PHP.3 Resistance to physical attack

Dependencies:               No dependencies.
FPT_PHP.3.1                 The TSF shall resist physical manipulation and physical probing to the TSF by re-
                            sponding automatically such that the SFRs are always enforced.


PP0068v2 application note 53: The TOE will implement appropriate measures to continuously counter
physical manipulation and physical probing. Due to the nature of these attacks (especially manipulation)
the TOE can by no means detect attacks on all of its elements. Therefore, permanent protection against
these attacks is required ensuring that the TSP could not be violated at any time. Hence, “automatic re-
sponse” means here (i) assuming that there might be an attack at any time and (ii) countermeasures are
provided at any time.

6.3 Security Assurance Requirements for the TOE
The requirements for the evaluation of the TOE and its development and operating environment are those
taken from the
                  Evaluation Assurance Level 5 (EAL5)
and augmented by taking the following components:
                  ALC_DVS.2 and AVA_VAN.5.


PP application note 49: The TOE shall protect the assets against high attack potential under the assumption
that the inspection system will prevent eavesdropping to their communication with the TOE before secure
messaging is successfully established based on the Chip Authentication Protocol v.1
(OE.Prot_Logical_MRTD). If the TOE is operated in non-certified mode using the BAC-established communi-
cation channel, the confidentiality of the standard data shall be protected against attackers with at least
Enhanced-Basic attack potential (AVA_VAN.3).

                Table 14: Overview of the security functional requirements coverage.

This security target claims strict conformance to the Protection Profiles given insection 2.2. Therefore this
security target includes the Security Requirements Rationale of the Protection Profiles as summarized
above; for details on the Rationale please refer to the Protection Profiles [PP0056v2] and [PP0068v2].
The security objective OT.Active_Auth_Proof “Proof of travel document’s chipauthenticity” is ensured by
the Active Authentication Mechanism [ICODoc] provided by FIA_API.1/AA proving the identity of the TOE.
The Active Authentication Protocol defined by FIA_API.1/AA is performed using a TOE internally stored con-
fidential private key as required by FMT_MTD.1/AA. This key can either be written to the TOE as defined by

FMT_MTD.1/AA or created on the TOE itself as supported by FCS_CKM.1/AA. The Active Authentication
Protocol requires additional TSF according to FCS_COP.1/SIG_GEN.

6.4.2 Dependency Rationale
The dependency analysis for the security functional requirements shows that the basis for mutual support
and internal consistency between all defined functional requirements is satisfied. All dependencies between
the chosen functional components are analyzed, and non-dissolved dependencies are appropriately ex-
plained.

                             Table 15: Dependencies between the SFR for the TOE

Justifications for non-satisfied dependencies between the SFR for TOE:
No. 1: The access control TSF according to FDP_ACF.1/TRM uses security attributes which are defined during
the personalisation and are fixed over the whole life time of the TOE. No management of these security
attribute (i.e. SFR FMT_MSA.1 and FMT_MSA.3) is necessary here.
No. 2: A Diffie-Hellman key agreement is used in order to have no key distribution, therefore FCS_CKM.2
makes no sense in this case.80
No. 3: The Active Authentication key pair cannot be deleted or regenerated.

6.4.3 Security Assurance Requirements Rationale
The EAL5 was chosen to permit a developer to gain maximum assurance from positive security engineering
based on good commercial development practices and a Java card platform that offers cryptographic func-
tionality certified according to EAL5 or higher.
The selection of the component ALC_DVS.2 provides a higher assurance of the security of the travel docu-
ment’s development and manufacturing especially for the secure handling of the travel document’s mate-
rial.
The selection of the component AVA_VAN.5 provides a higher assurance of the security by vulnerability
analysis to assess the resistance to penetration attacks performed by an attacker possessing a high attack
potential. This vulnerability analysis is necessary to fulfil the security objectives OT.Sens_Data_Conf and
OT.Chip_Auth_Proof.
The component ALC_DVS.2 has no dependencies. The component AVA_VAN.5 has the following dependen-
cies:
             ADV_ARC.1 Security architecture description
             ADV_FSP.4 Complete functional specification
             ADV_TDS.3 Basic modular design
             ADV_IMP.1 Implementation representation of the TSF
             AGD_OPE.1 Operational user guidance
             AGD_PRE.1 Preparative procedures

All of these are met or exceeded in the EAL5 assurance package.


80   This justification was taken from [PP0068v2].

6.4.4 Security Requirements – Mutual Support and Internal Consistency
This security target claims strict conformance to the Protection Profiles given insection 2.2. Therefore this
security target includes the analysis of the internal consistency of the Security Requirements of the Protec-
tion Profiles without repeating these here.
As the complete Security Problem Definition, the Extended Components and the Security Functional Re-
quirements have also been included, the consistency analysis of the Protection Profiles is also valid for this
security target.
The additions made to include the Active Authentication Mechansim have been integrated in a consistent
way to the model designed by the Protection Profiles, e. g. by using the subject, object and operation defi-
nitions.
Inconsistency between functional and assurance requirements could only arise if there are functional-as-
surance dependencies which are not met, a possibility which has been shown not to arise in sections 6.3.2
Dependency Rationale and 6.3.3 Security Assurance Requirements Rationale. Furthermore, as also dis-
cussed in section 6.3.3 Security
Assurance Requirements Rationale, the chosen assurance components are adequate for the functionality
of the TOE. So the assurance requirements and security functional requirements support each other and
there are no inconsistencies between the goals ofthese two groups of security requirements.

7 TOE summary specification (ASE_TSS)

7.1 TOE Security Functionality

7.1.1 TSF_Access: Access Control
This security functionality manages the access to objects (files, directories, data and secrets) stored in the
applet’s file system. It also controls write access of initialization, pre-personalization and personalization
data. Access control for initialization and pre-personalization in Phase 2 – while the actual applet is not yet
present – is based on the card manager of the underlying NXP JCOP 3 SECID P60 CS Java Card platform
(SF.AccessControl, SF.I&A).
Access is granted (or denied) in accordance to access rights that depend on appropriate identification and
authentication mechanisms.
TSF_Access covers the following SFRs:
       FIA_UID.1.1/PACE requires that the TSF shall allow to establish the communication channel, to carry
        out the PACE Protocol, to read the Initialization Data if it is not disabled by TSF according to
        FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS, to carry out the Chip Authentication Protocol, to carry out the Terminal Au-
        thentication Protocol, and to carry out the Active Authentication Mechanism on behalf of the user
        to be performed before the user is identified. FIA_UID.1.2 requires that the TSF shall require each
        user to be successfully identified before allowing any other TSF-mediated actions on behalf of that
        user. TSF_Access realizes the appropriate control of the access rights, TSF_Auth the authentication
        mechanisms.
       FIA_UAU.1/PACE requires that the TSF shall allow to establish the communication channel, to carry
        out the PACE Protocol, to read the Initialization Data if it is not disabled by TSF according to
        FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS, to identify themselves by selection of the authentication key, to carry out the
        Chip Authentication Protocol, to carry out the Terminal Authentication Protocol, and to carry out
        the Active Authentication Mechanism on behalf of the user to be performed before the user is au-
        thenticated. FIA_UAU.1.2 requires that the TSF shall require each user to be successfully authenti-
        cated before allowing any other TSF-mediated actions on behalf of that user. TSF_Access realizes
        the appropriate control of the access rights.
       FIA_UAU.4/PACE requires that the TSF shall prevent reuse of authentication data related to the
        PACE Protocol, the Terminal Authentication Protocol, and the Authentication Mechanism based on
        AES. TSF_Access realizes the appropriate control of the access rights.
       FIA_UAU.5.1/PACE requires that the TSF shall provide the PACE Protocol, Passive Authentication,
        Terminal Authentication, Secure messaging in MAC-ENC mode, Symmetric Authentication Mecha-
        nism based on AES, and the Terminal Authentication Protocol to support user authentication.
        FIA_UAU.5.2/PACE requires that the TSF shall authenticate any user’s claimed identity according to

       FPT_TST.1.1 requires that the TSF shall run a suite of self tests during initial start-up to demonstrate
        the correct operation of the TSF. FPT_TST.1.2 requires that the TSF shall provide authorised users
        with the capability to verify the integrity of TSF data. FPT_TST.1.3 requires that the TSF shall provide
        authorised users with the capability to verify the integrity of stored TSF executable code. This all is
        realized by TSF_OS, in parts due to the characteristics of the hardware platform.
       FPT_PHP.3.1 requires that the TSF shall resist physical manipulation and physical probing to the TSF
        by responding automatically such that the SFRs are always enforced. This all is realized by TSF_OS,
        in parts due to the characteristics of the hardware platform.


7.2 TOE summary specification rationale
This summary specification shows that the TSF and assurance measures are appropriateto fulfill the TOE
security requirements.
Each TOE security functional requirement is implemented by at least one security functionality. The map-
ping of TOE Security Requirements and TOE Security Functionalities isgiven in the following table. If itera-
tions of a TOE security requirement are covered by the same TOE security functionality the mapping will
appear only once. The description of the TSF is given in section 7.1.                           TSF_SecureMessaging

Glossary
Active authentication       Security mechanism defined in [ICAODoc] by which means the MTRD’s chip
                            proves and the inspection system verifies the identity and authenticity of the
                            MTRD’s chip as part of a genuine MRTD issued by a known State of organization.
AES                         The AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) has been defined as a standard for
                            symmetric data encryption. It is a block cipher with a block length of 128 bit and
                            key lengths of 128, 192 and 256 bit.
Application note            Optional informative part of the PP containing additional supporting infor-
                            mation that is considered relevant or useful for the construction, evaluation, or
                            use of the TOE.
Asymmetric cipher           Encryption procedures employing two different keys (in contrast to a symmetric
                            cipher): one publicly known (public key) for data encryption and one key only
                            known to the message receiver (private key) for decryption.
Audit records               Write-only-once non-volatile memory area of the MRTDs chip to store the Ini-
                            tialization Data and Pre-personalization Data.
Authentication              Authentication defines a procedure that verifies the identity of the communica-
                            tion partner. The most elegant method is based on the use of so called digital
                            signatures.
BAC                         Basic access control. Security mechanism defined in [ICAODoc] by which means
                            the MTRD’s chip proves and the inspection system protects their communica-
                            tion by means of secure messaging.
Basic access keys           Pair of symmetric Triple-DES keys used for secure messaging with encryption
                            (key KENC) and message authentication (key KMAC) of data transmitted between
                            the MRTD’s chip and the inspection system [ICAODoc]. It is drawn from the
                            printed MRZ of the passport book to authenticate an entity able to read the
                            printed MRZ of the passport book.
Block cipher                An algorithm processing the plaintext in bit groups (blocks). Its alternative is
                            called stream cipher.
CA                          Certification authority
Certificate                 see digital certificate
Certificate revocation      A list of revoked certificates issued by a certificate authority

Cryptography                In the classical sense, the science of encrypting messages. Today, this notion
                            comprises a larger field and also includes problems like authentication or digital
                            signatures.

Current date                The maximum of the effective dates of valid CVCA, DV and domestic Inspection
                            System certificates known to the TOE. It is used the validate card verifiable cer-
                            tificates.
CVCA link certificate       Certificate of the new public key of the Country Verifying Certification Authority
                            signed with the old public key of the Country Verifying Certification Authority
                            where the certificate effective date for the new key is before the certificate ex-
                            piration date of the certificate for the old key.
DES                         (Data Encryption Standard) symmetric 64 bit block cipher, which was developed
                            (first under the name Lucifer) by IBM. The key length is 64 bit of which 8 bit serve
                            for a parity check. DES is the classic among the encryption algorithms, which
                            nevertheless is no longer secure due to its insufficient key length. Alternatives
                            are Triple-DES or the successor AES.
Digital certificate         A data set that identifies the certification authority issuing it, identifies its
                            owner, contains the ower's public key, identifies its operational period, and is
                            digitally signed by the certification authority issuing it.
Digital signature           The counterpart of a handwritten signature for documents in digital format. A
                            digital signature grants authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation. These
                            features are achieved by using asymmetric procedures.
Document verifier           Certification authority creating the Inspection System Certificates and managing
                            the authorization of the Extended Inspection Systems for the sensitive data of
                            the MRTD in the limits provided by the issuing States or Organizations
EAC                         Extended access control. Security mechanism identified in [ICAODoc]by which
                            means the MTRD’s chip (i) verifies the authentication of the inspection systems
                            authorized to read the optional biometric reference data, (ii) controls the access
                            to the optional biometric reference data and (iii) protects the confidentiality and
                            integrity of the optional biometric reference data during their transmission to
                            the inspection system by secure messaging.
ECC                         (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) class of procedures providing an attractive alterna-
                            tive for the probably most popular asymmetric procedure, the RSA algorithm.
Elliptic curves             A mathematical construction, in which a part of the usual operations applies,
                            and which has been employed successfully in cryptography since 1985.
Fingerprint (digital)       Checksum that can be used to easily determine the correctness of a key without
                            having to compare the entire key. This is often done by comparing the hash val-
                            ues after application of a hash function.
Hash function               A function which forms the fixed-size result (the hash value) from an arbitrary
                            amount of data (which is the input). These functions are used to generate the
                            electronic equivalent of a fingerprint. The significant factor is that it must be
                            impossible to generate two entries which lead to the same hash value (so called
                            collisions) or even to generate a matching message for a defined hash value.
                            Common hash functions are RIPEMD-160 and SHA-1, each having hash values
                            with a length of 160 bit as well as the MD5, which is still often used today having
                            a hash value length of 128 bit.
Inspection system           A technical system used by the border control officer of the receiving State (i)
                            examining an MRTD presented by the traveller and verifying its authenticity and
                            (ii) verifying the traveller as MRTD holder.

Integrity                   The test on the integrity of data is carried out by checking messages for changes
                            during the transmission by the receiver. Common test procedures employ Hash-
                            functions, MACs (Message Authentication Codes) or – with additional function-
                            ality – digital signatures.
Javacard                    A smart card with a Javacard operation system.
Key exchange                The use of symmetric cipher procedures requires that two communication part-
                            ners decide on one joint key only known to themselves. The difficulty is that for
                            the exchange of such information usually only partially secure channels exist.
                            Additionally, protocols for key exchange must be prepared in such a way that
                            only those pieces of information are exchanged which do not lead to knowledge
                            of the real secret (the key). The most popular protocol of that type is diffie-
                            Hellman, whose presentation in 1976 can be regarded as the birth of public key
                            cryptography.
LDS                         Logical data structure. The collection of groupings of data elements stored in
                            the optional capacity expansion technology, defined in [ICAODoc].
MAC                         Algorithm that expands the message by means of a secret key by special redun-
                            dant pieces of information, which are stored or transmitted together with the
                            message. To prevent an attacker from targeted modification of the attached re-
                            dundancy, requires its protection in a suitable way.
MRTD                        Machnine-readable travel document. Official document issued by a State or Or-
                            ganization which is used by the holder for international travel (e.g. passport,
                            visa, official document of identity) and which contains mandatory visual (eye
                            readable) data and a separate mandatory data summary, intended for global
                            use, reflecting essential data elements capable of being machine read.
MRZ                         Fixed dimensional area located on the front of the MRTD or MRP Data Page or,
                            in the case of the TD1, the back of the MRTD, containing mandatory and optional
                            data for machine reading using OCR methods.
Non-repudiation             One of the objectives in the employment of digital signatures. It describes the
                            fact that the sender of a message is prevented from denying the preparation of
                            the message. The problem cannot be simply solved with cryptographic routines,
                            but the entire environment needs to be considered and respective framework
                            conditions need to be provided by pertinent laws.
Passive authentication      (i) verification of the digital signature of the Document Security Object and (ii)
                            comparing the hash values of the read LDS data fields with the hash values con-
                            tained in the Document Security Object.
Passphrase                  A long, but memorable character sequence (e.g. short sentences with punctua-
                            tion) which should replace passwords as they offer more security.
Password                    A secret character sequence whose knowledge is to serve as a replacement for
                            the authentication of a participant. A password is usually short to really ensure
                            that an attacker cannot guess the password by trial and error.
Personalization             The process by which the portrait, signature and biographical data are applied
                            to the document.
Personalization agent       The agent acting on the behalf of the issuing State or organisation to personalize
                            the MRTD for the holder by (i) establishing the identity the holder for the bio-
                            graphic data in the MRTD, (ii) enrolling the biometric reference data of the
                            MRTD holder i.e. the portrait, the encoded finger image(s) or (ii) the encoded
                            iris image(s) and (iii) writing these data on the physical and logical MRTD for the
                            holder.

PP                          Protection Profile
Private key                 Secret key only known to the receiver of a message, which is used in asymmetric
                            ciphers for encryption or generation of digital signatures.
Pseudo random num-          Many cryptographic mechanisms require random numbers (e.g. in key genera-
ber                         tion). The problem, however, is that it is difficult to implement true random
                            numbers in software. Therefore, so called pseudo-random number generators
                            are used, which then should be initialized with a real random element (the so
                            called seed).
Public key                  Publicly known key in an asymmetric cipher which is used for encryption and
                            verification of digital signatures.
Public key infrastruc-      Combination of hardware and software components, policies, and different pro-
ture (PKI)                  cedures used to manage digital certificates.
Random numbers              Many cryptographic algorithms or protocols require a random element, mostly
                            in form of a random number, which is newly generated in each case. In these
                            cases, the security of the procedure depends in part on the suitability of these
                            random numbers. As the generation of real random numbers within computers
                            still imposes a problem (a source for real random events can in fact only be
                            gained by exact observation of physical events, which is not easy to realize for a
                            software), so called pseudo random numbers are used instead.
Secure messaging            Secure messaging using encryption and message authentication code according
                            to ISO/IEC 7816-4.

                            printed MRZ data.
Smart card                  A smart card is a chip card which contains an internal micro controller with CPU,
                            volatile (RAM) and non-volatile (ROM, EEPROM) memory, i.e. which can carry
                            out its own calculations in contrast to a simple storage card. Sometimes a smart
                            card has a numerical coprocessor (NPU) to execute public key algorithms effi-
                            ciently. Smart cards have all of their functionality comprised on a single chip (in
                            contrast to chip cards, which contain several chips wired to each other). There-
                            fore, such a smart card is ideal for use in cryptography as it is almost impossible
                            to manipulate its internal processes.
SOD                         Document Security Object (stored in EF.SOD). A RFC3369 CMS Signed Data
                            Structure, signed by the Document Signer (DS). Carries the hash values of the
                            LDS Data Groups. It is stored in the MRTD’s chip. It may carry the Document
                            Signer Certificate (CDS).
ST                          Security Target
Stream cipher               Symmetric encryption algorithm which processes the plaintext bit-by-bit or
                            byte-by-byte. The other usually employed class of procedures comprises so
                            called block cipher.
Symmetric cipher            Encryption procedure using the same key for enciphering and deciphering (or,
                            in which these two keys can simply be derived from each other). One distin-
                            guishes between block ciphers processing plaintext in blocks of fixed length
                            (mostly 64 or 128 bit) and stream ciphers working on the basis of single charac-
                            ters.
