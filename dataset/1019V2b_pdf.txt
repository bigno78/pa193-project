                              1.3 TOE Overview


                           1.3.1 Introduction
                                    The Hardware Security Target [13] contains, in section 1.3 “TOE Overview”, an
                                    introduction about the N7021 hardware TOE that is considered in the evaluation. The
                                    Hardware Security Target includes IC Dedicated Software provided with the N7021
                                    hardware platform.
                                    The “Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA“ is a cryptographic library that can be used by
                                    the Security IC Embedded Software. The cryptographic library consists of several binary
                                    packages that are intended to be linked to the Security IC Embedded Software. The
                                    Security IC Embedded Software developer links the binary packages that he needs to his
                                    Embedded Software and the whole is subsequently implemented in arbitrary memory of
                                    the hardware platform.
                                    The NXP N7021 provides the computing platform and cryptographic support by means of
                                    co-processors for the Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA.
                                    The Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA provides the security functionality described
                                    below in addition to the functionality described in the Hardware Security Target [13] for
                                    the hardware platform:
                                    The Crypto Library provides RSA, RSA key generation, RSA public key computation,
                                    ECDSA (ECC over GF(p)) signature generation and verification, ECDSA (ECC over
                                    GF(p)) key generation, ECDH (ECC Diffie-Hellmann) key-exchange, standard security
                                    level SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512.

                           1.3.2 Life-Cycle
                                    The life cycle of the hardware platform as part of the TOE is described in section 1.4.4
                                    "Security During Development and Production" of the Hardware Security Target [13]. The
                                    delivery process or the hardware platform is independent from the Crypto Library Cobalt
                                    on N7021 VA.
                                    The Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA is delivered in Phase 1 (for a definition of the
                                    Phases refer to Section 1.2.3 'TOE life cycle’ of the Protection Profile [5]) as a software
                                    package (a set of binary files) to the developers of Security IC Embedded Software. The
                                    Security IC Embedded Software may comprise in this case an operating system and/or
                                    other smart card software (applications). The Software developer can incorporate the
                                    Crypto Library into their product.
                                    The subsequent use of the Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA by Security IC Embedded
                                    Software Developers is out of the control of the developer NXP Semiconductors; the
                                    integration of the Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA into Security IC Embedded
                                    Software is not part of this evaluation.
                                    Security during Development and Production
                                    The development process of the Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA is part of the
                                    evaluation. The access to the implementation documentation, test bench and the source
                                    code is restricted to the development team of the Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA.
                                    The security measures installed within NXP, including a secure delivery process, ensure
                                    the integrity and quality of the delivered Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA binary files.

                           1.3.3 Specific Issues of Hardware and the Common Criteria
                                    Regarding the Application Note 2 of the Protection Profile [5] the TOE provides additional
                                    functionality which is not covered in the Protection profile [5] and the Hardware Security
                                    Target [13]. This additional functionality is added using the policy “P.Add-CryptoLib-
                                    Func” (see Section 3.3 of this Security Target).

                              1.4 TOE Description
                                    The Target of Evaluation (TOE) consists of a hardware part and a software part:
                                    • The hardware part consists of the N7021 with IC Dedicated Software. The hardware
                                      part of the TOE includes dedicated guidance documentation.
                                    • The software part consists of the IC Dedicated Support Software “Crypto Library Cobalt
                                      on N7021 VA” which consists of a software library and associated documentation. The
                                      Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA is an additional part that provides cryptographic
                                      functions that can be operated on the hardware platform as described in this Security
                                      Target.
                                    The hardware part of the TOE is not described in detail in this document. Details are
                                    included in the Hardware Security Target [13] and therefore this latter document will be
                                    cited wherever appropriate.
                                    The TOE components consist of all the TOE components listed in Table 1 of the

                                    Hardware Security Target [13]. The IC Dedicated Software delivered with the hardware
                                    platform is described in section 1.4.3.2 “Software Description” of the Hardware Security
                                    Target [13].
                                    As described in the Hardware Security Target [13], the N7021 hardware provides the
                                    customer with a configuration option to disable the PKCC coprocessor. When the PKCC
                                    is disabled using this option, it is no longer possible to make use of the packages 'RSA
                                    Encryption / Decryption', 'RSA Key Generation' and 'ECC over GF(p)' provided by this

                                    • The RSA algorithm can be used for encryption and decryption as well as for signature
                                      generation, signature verification, message encoding and signature encoding.
                                    • The RSA key generation can be used to generate RSA key pairs.
                                    • The RSA public key computation can be used to compute the public key that belongs to
                                      a given private CRT key.
                                    The TOE supports various key sizes for RSA up to a limit of 4096 bits.
                                    RSA functionality is not available in case the customer disabled the PKCC coprocessor
                                    as part of the hardware configuration. See the Hardware Security Target [13] for more
                                    information.

                                    • The ECDSA (ECC over GF(p)) algorithm can be used for signature generation and
                                      signature verification.
                                    • The ECDSA (ECC over GF(p)) key generation algorithm can be used to generate ECC

                                    • The ECDH (ECC Diffie-Hellman) key exchange algorithm can be used to establish
                                      cryptographic keys. It can be also used as secure point multiplication.
                                    The TOE supports various key sizes for ECC over GF(p) up to a limit of 640 bits for
                                    signature generation, key pair generation and key exchange. For signature verification
                                    the TOE supports key sizes up to a limit of 640 bits.

                                      creation or key derivation.
                                    Resistance of cryptographic algorithms against attacks
                                    The cryptographic algorithms are designed taking into account the attacks described in
                                    JIL-ATT-SC: Attack Methods for Smartcards and Similar Devices [19].

                                    • The TOE includes internal security measures for residual information protection.
                                    Note that the TOE does not restrict access to the functions provided by the hardware:
                                    these functions are still directly accessible to the Security IC Embedded Software.


                                      1 These crypto functions are supplied as a library rather than as a monolithic program, and hence a user of
                                          the library may include only those functions that are actually required – it is not necessary to include all
                                          cryptographic functions of the library in every Security IC Embedded Software. For example, it is possible
                                          to omit the RSA or the ECC components. However, some dependencies exist; details are described in
                                          the User Guidance [6].

                           1.4.4 Interface of the TOE
                                    The interface to the NXP N7021 hardware is described in section 1.4.5 “Interface of the
                                    TOE” of the Hardware Security Target [13]. The use of this interface is not restricted by
                                    the use of the Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA.
                                    The interface to the TOE additionally consists of software function calls, as detailed in
                                    the “User Manual” documents of the Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA. The developer
                                    of the Security IC Embedded Software will link the required functionality of the Crypto
                                    Library Cobalt on N7021 VA into the Security IC Embedded Software as required for his

                           1.4.5 Life Cycle and Delivery of the TOE
                                    The life cycle and delivery for the NXP N7021 hardware is described in section 1.4.4
                                    “Security during development and production” of the Hardware Security Target [13].
                                    The Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA is delivered as part of Phase 1 (for a definition
                                    of the Phases refer to section ‘1.2.3 TOE life cycle’ of the Protection Profile [5]) to the
                                    Security IC Embedded Software developer. The Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA
                                    may be delivered by e-mail or by Document Control (DocuControl or DocStore) or by
                                    delivering physical media such as compact disks by mail or courier. To protect the Crypto
                                    Library Cobalt on N7021 VA during the delivery process, the Crypto Library Cobalt
                                    on N7021 VA is encrypted and digitally signed. The Security IC Embedded Software
                                    developer then integrates the Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA in the Security IC
                                    Embedded Software.

                           1.4.6 TOE Intended Usage
                                    Regarding to Phase 7 (for a definition of the Phases refer to section ‘1.2.3 TOE life
                                    cycle’ of the Protection Profile [5]), the combination of the hardware and the Security
                                    IC Embedded Software is used by the end-user. The method of use of the product in
                                    this phase depends on the application. The TOE is intended to be used in an unsecured
                                    environment, that is, the TOE does not rely on the Phase 7 environment to counter any
                                    threat.
                                    For details on the usage of the hardware platform refer to section 1.4.5 “TOE Intended
                                    Usage” in the Hardware Security Target [13].

2         CC Conformance and Evaluation Assurance Level
                                    The evaluation is based upon:
                                    • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 1: Introduction
                                      and general model, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April 2017, CCMB-2017-04-001" [1]
                                    • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 2: Security
                                      functional components, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April 2017, CCMB-2017-04-002" [2]
                                    • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 3: Security
                                      assurance components, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April 2017, CCMB-2017-04-003" [3]
                                    For the evaluation the following methodology will be used:
                                    • "Common Methodology for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Evaluation
                                      Methodology, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April 2017, CCMB-2017-04-004" [4]
                                    The chosen level of assurance is EAL6 + augmented.
                                    The augmentations to EAL6 are ASE_TSS.2 and ALC_FLR.1.
                                    This Security Target claims the following CC conformances:
                                    • CC 3.1 Part 2 extended, Part 3 conformant, EAL6 augmented
                                    • Strict Conformance to the Protection Profile [5]
                                    The assurance level for evaluation and the functionality of the TOE are chosen in order to
                                    allow the confirmation that the TOE is suitable for use within devices compliant with the
                                    German Digital Signature Law.
                                    Note 1. The hardware platform is evaluated according to the assurance level EAL 6
                                    augmented. The evaluation of the hardware platform is appropriate for the composite
                                    evaluation since both the EAL level and the augmentations claimed in this Security
                                    Target are identical to those claimed for the hardware platform (refer to the Hardware
                                    Security Target [13]).

                              2.1 Conformance claim rationale
                                    According to chapter 2 this Security Target claims strict conformance to the Protection
                                    Profile [5]. As shown in 1.3 the composed TOE consists of hardware (Secure Controller
                                    IC) and software (IC Dedicated Software). This is identical to the TOE as defined in [5]
                                    and therefore the TOE type is consistent.

3         Security Problem Definition

                              3.1 Description of Assets
                                    Since this Security Target claims strict conformance to a PP [5], the assets defined in
                                    section 3.1 of the Protection Profile apply to this Security Target. User Data and TSF
                                    data are defined as part of assets in [13]. Since the data computed by the Crypto Library
                                    contains keys, plain text and cipher text that are considered as User Data and e.g.
                                    blinding vectors that are considered as TSF data the assets are considered as complete
                                    for this Security Target.

                              3.2 Threats
                                    Since this Security Target claims strict conformance to the PP [5], the threats defined in
                                    section 3.2 of the Protection Profile, and which are described in section 3.2 “Threats” of
                                    the Hardware Security Target [13] are valid for this Security Target. No additional threats
                                    are defined for this Security Target.

                              3.3 Organizational Security Policies
                                    In addition to the security functionality provided by the hardware and defined in the
                                    hardware security target [13], the following additional security functionality is provided by
                                    the Crypto Library for use by the Security IC Embedded Software:
                                    P.Add-CryptoLib-Func: Additional Specific Security Functionality
                                    The TOE provides the following additional security functionality to the Security IC
                                    Embedded Software:
                                    • RSA encryption, decryption, signature generation, signature verification, message
                                      encoding and signature encoding.
                                    • RSA public key computation
                                    • RSA key generation,
                                    • ECDSA (ECC over GF(p)) signature generation and verification,
                                    • ECC over GF(p) key generation,
                                    • ECDH (ECC Diffie-Hellman) key exchange,
                                    • SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 Hash Algorithms.
                                    In addition, the TOE shall provide resistance against attacks as described in Note 4 and
                                    in Security architectural information.
                                    Regarding the Application Note 5 of the Protection Profile [5] there are no other additional
                                    policies defined in this Security Target.

                              3.4 Assumptions
                                    The assumptions are described in the Hardware Security Target [13]. No additional
                                    assumptions are defined for this Security Target.

4         Security Objectives
                                    This chapter contains the following sections: “Security Objectives for the TOE”, “Security
                                    Objectives for the Security IC Embedded Software”, “Security Objectives for the
                                    Operational Environment”, and “Security Objectives Rationale”.

                              4.1 Security Objectives for the TOE
                                    The security objectives for the TOE defined in the Protection Profile [5] and the Hardware
                                    Security Target [13] are entirely applied to this Security Target.
                                    The following additional security objectives for the Crypto Library are defined by this ST,
                                    and are provided by the software part of the TOE:
                                    O.RSA                                            The TOE includes functionality to provide encryption,
                                                                                     decryption, signature creation, signature verification,
                                                                                     message encoding and signature encoding using the

                                    O.RSA_PubExp                                     The TOE includes functionality to compute an RSA
                                                                                     public key from an RSA private key, see Note 4.
                                    O.RSA_KeyGen                                     The TOE includes functionality to generate RSA key
                                                                                     pairs, see Note 4.

                                                                                     creation and signature verification using the ECC over
                                                                                     GF(p) algorithm, see Note 4.
                                    O.ECC_DHKE                                       The TOE includes functionality to provide Diffie-Hellman
                                                                                     key exchange based on ECC over GF(p), see Note 4.
                                    O.ECC_KeyGen                                     The TOE includes functionality to generate ECC over
                                                                                     GF(p) key pairs, see Note 4.
                                    O.SHA                                            The TOE includes functionality to provide electronic
                                                                                     hashing facilities using the SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256,

                                    Note 4. All introduced security objectives claiming cryptographic functionality are
                                    protected against attacks as described in JIL-ATT-SC: Attack Methods for Smartcards
                                    and Similar Devices [19], which include Side Channel Attacks, Perturbation attacks,
                                    Differential Fault Analysis (DFA) and timing attacks. The following exceptions apply:
                                    1. RSA Public Key computation and RSA Key generation do not contain protective
                                       measures against DPA
                                    2. ECDSA (ECC over GF(p)) Key Generation does not contain protective measures
                                       against DPA
                                    3. SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 do not contain protective
                                       measures against DPA, DFA and timing attacks. It provides countermeasures against
                                       template attacks targeting the input message and the output digest.
                                    This does not mean that the algorithm is insecure; rather at the time of this security
                                    target no promising attacks were found. More details about conditions and restrictions for
                                    resistance against attacks are given in the user documentation of the Crypto Library.

                              4.2 Security Objectives for the IC Embedded Software
                                    The security objectives for the Security IC Embedded Software defined in section 4.2 of
                                    the Protection Profile [5] and additional refinements in the Hardware Security Target [13]
                                    entirely apply to this Security Target.
                                    The TOE assumes that the Security IC Embedded Software abides by the provisions
                                    detailed in “Clarification of Treatment of user data of the Composite TOE (OE.Resp-
                                    Appl)” contained within section 4.2 “Security Objectives for the Security IC Embedded
                                    Software” of the Hardware Security Target [13].

                              4.3 Security Objectives for the Operational Environment
                                    The security objective for the “Security Objectives for the Operational environment”
                                    defined in the PP [5], and given in the Hardware Security Target [13] are entirely valid for
                                    this Security Target.

                              4.4 Security Objectives Rationale
                                    Section 4.4 of the Protection Profile [5] and Section 4.4 of the Hardware Security Target
                                    [13] provide a rationale how the threats, organisational security policies and assumptions
                                    are addressed by the objectives that are subject of the PP. They entirely apply to this
                                    Security Target. The justification for the additional security objectives for the Crypto
                                    Library on N7021 are listed in the table below:

P.Add-CryptoLib-Func                                                                      O.RSA
                                                                                          O.RSA_PubExp
                                                                                          O.RSA_KeyGen
                                                                                          O.ECDSA
                                                                                          O.ECC_DHKE
                                                                                          O.ECC_KeyGen
                                                                                          O.SHA

                                    They are in line with the security objectives of the Protection Profile and supplement
                                    these according to the additional assumptions and organisational security policy.
                                    The rationale for all item defined in the Security Target is given below.
                                    Since the objectives O.RSA, O.RSA_PubExp, O.RSA_KeyGen, O.ECDSA,
                                    O.ECC_DHKE, O.ECC_KeyGen and O.SHA require the TOE to implement exactly
                                    the same specific security functionality as required by P.Add-CryptoLib-Func, the
                                    organizational security policy P.Add-CryptoLib-Func is covered by the security objectives.
                                    Additionally, the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing, O.Malfunction,
                                    O.Phys-Manipulation and O.Leak-Forced define how to implement the specific security
                                    functionality required by P.Add-CryptoLib-Func and therefore support P.Add-CryptoLib-
                                    Func. These security objectives are also valid for the additional specific security
                                    functionality since they must also avert the related threats for the components added to
                                    the organisational security policy.
                                    The justification of the additional policy and the additional assumptions show that they
                                    do not contradict with the rationale already given in the Protection Profile [5] for the
                                    assumptions, policy and threats defined there.

                                    To support a better understanding of the combination Protection Profile and Security
                                    Target of the hardware platform (N7021) vs. this Security Target (Crypto Library Cobalt
                                    on N7021 VA), the TOE SFRs are presented in the following sections.

                           6.1.1 SFRs from the Protection Profile and the Security Target of the platform
                                    The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) for this TOE (Crypto Library Cobalt on
                                    N7021 VA) are specified based on the Smart Card IC Platform Protection Profile [5], and
                                    are defined in the Common Criteria [2] or in the Protection Profile [5]. They entirely apply
                                    to this Security Target.
                                    Note 5. These requirements have already been stated in the Hardware Security Target
                                    [13] and are fulfilled by the chip hardware, if not indicated otherwise in this Section.
                                    The additional SFRs shown in this Section are defined in the Common Criteria, described
                                    in sections 6.1.3 “Security Functional Requirements added in this Security Target” of the
                                    Hardware Security Target [13]. They entirely apply to this Security Target.

                           6.1.2 Security Functional Requirements added in this Security Target

                                    Security Assurance Requirement ADV_SPM.1 requires the developer to provide a
                                    Security Policy Model for the Crypto Library. However, the N7021 hardware already
                                    provides a Security Policy Model (see [13] for details), which also applies unchanged
                                    to the composite product. As the SFRs introduced in this ST do not add a new Security
                                    Policy or change the rules of existing Security Policies of the hardware, there is no need
                                    for an additional Security Policy Model for the Crypto Library.

                           6.2.1 Refinements of the Security Assurance Requirements for EAL6+
                                    The Security Target claims strict conformance to the Protection Profile [5], and therefore
                                    it has to be conform to the refinements of the TOE security assurance requirements (see
                                    Application Note 23 of the PP [5]).
                                    The Hardware Security Target [13] for N7021 has chosen the evaluation assurance
                                    level EAL6+. The Security Target of the hardware platform with IC Dedicated Software
                                    including cryptographic library is based on the Protection Profile [5], which requires
                                    the lower level EAL4+. This implies that the refinements made in the Protection Profile
                                    [5], section 6.2.1 Refinements of the TOE Assurance Requirements, for EAL4+ had to
                                    be refined again in order to ensure EAL6+ in the Hardware Security Target (this was
                                    necessary for ALC_CMS.5, ALC_CMC.5, ADV_IMP.2, ATE_COV.3, and ADV_FSP.5).
                                    Since these refinements explain and interpret the CC for hardware, these refinements do
                                    not affect the additional software in this composite TOE. Therefore all refinements made
                                    in the PP [5] are valid without change for the composite TOE.

                              6.3 Security Requirements Rationale


                           6.3.1    Rationale for the Security Functional Requirements
                                    Section 6.3.1 of the PP [5] and Section 6.3.1 of the Hardware Security Target [13]

                                    the TOE. This mapping entirely apply to this Security Target.
                                    This ST lists a number of security objectives and SFRs for Crypto Library, which are
                                    additional to both the PP and the Hardware ST. These are listed in the following table.

                                    O.ECDSA, O.ECC_DHKE, O.ECC_KeyGen and O.SHA are all as follows:
                                    • Each objective is directly implemented by a single SFR specifying the (cryptographic)
                                      service that the objective wishes to achieve (see the above table for the mapping).
                                    • The requirements and architectural measures that originally were taken from the
                                      Protection Profile [5] and thus were also part of the Security Target of the hardware
                                      (chip) evaluation support the security objectives:
                                      – FRU_FLT.2 and FPT_FLS.1 supports the objective by ensuring that the TOE works
                                        correctly (i.e., all of the TOE’s capabilities are ensured) within the specified operating
                                        conditions and maintains a secure state when the TOE is outside the specified

                                       User Data (plain text data, keys) or TSF Data is disclosed when they are transmitted
                                       between different functional units of the TOE (i.e., the different memories, the CPU,
                                       cryptographic co-processors), thereby supporting the objective in keeping confidential
                                       data secret.
                                     – FDP_IFC.1 also supports the aspects of confidentiality by ensuring that User
                                       Data and TSF Data are not accessible from the TOE except when the Security IC
                                       Embedded Software decides to communicate them via an external interface.
                                     – FDP_RIP.1[SW] and FCS_CKM.4 ensures that the TOE provides procedural
                                       measures to prevent disclosure of memory contents that was used by the TOE. The
                                       Crypto Library supports FDP_RIP.1[SW] and FCS_CKM.4 by making all memory
                                       contents used by the library no longer available. Note that the requirement for
                                       residual information protection applies to all functionality of the Crypto Library.

                           6.3.2 Extended requirements
                                    This Security Target does not define extended requirements.

                           6.3.3 Dependencies of security requirements
                                    SFRs [FDP_ITC.1, or FDP_ITC.2 or FCS_CKM.1] are not included in this Security Target
                                    for FCS_COP.1/SHA since the TOE only provides a pure engine for these algorithms
                                    without additional features like the handling of keys or importing data from outside the
                                    TOE. Therefore the Security IC Embedded Software must fulfil these requirements
                                    related to the needs of the realized application.

                           6.3.4 Rationale for the Assurance Requirements
                                    The selection of assurance components and augmentations of Crypto Library on N7021
                                    is generally based on EAL6, the underlying Protection Profile [5], and the Security Target
                                    of the hardware [13] of the N7021.
                                    EAL6 was chosen to provide an even stronger baseline of assurance than the EAL4 in
                                    the Protection Profile. The augmentations ALC_FLR.1 and ASE_TSS.2 were chosen to
                                    extend the level of assurance even further.

7         TOE Summary Specification
                                    This chapter describes the “IT Security Functionality”.

                              7.1 IT Security Functionality
                                    The evaluation of this cryptographic library is performed as a composite evaluation,
                                    where the TOE comprises both the underlying hardware and the embedded software
                                    (Crypto Library). The TOE of this composite evaluation therefore extends the security
                                    functionality already available in the chip platform (see section 7.1 “Portions of the TOE
                                    Security Functionality” of the Hardware Security [13]).
                                    The security functionality of N7021
                                    The security functionality of the hardware platform for the N7021 is described in the
                                    Hardware Security Target [13]. They entirely apply to this Security Target.
                                    Note 8. The security functionality SF.LOG is extended by the Crypto Library as described
                                    in Security Features of the TOE.


                                    The additional security functionality provided by the TOE is described in the following
                                    sub-sections.
                                    The IT security functionalities directly correspond to the TOE security functional
                                    requirements defined in Section 6.1. The definitions of the IT security functionalities refer
                                    to the corresponding security functional requirements.

                           7.1.1 Security Services of the TOE

                         7.1.1.1    SS.RSA

                                    The TOE provides functions that implement the RSA algorithm and the RSA-CRT
                                    algorithm for data encryption, decryption, signature and verification. All algorithms are
                                    defined in PKCS #1, v2.2 (RSAEP, RSADP, RSAP1, RSAVP1)
                                    This routine supports various key lengths from 512 bits to 4096 bits.
                                    The TOE contains modular exponentiation functions, which, together with other functions
                                    in the TOE, perform the operations required for RSA encryption or decryption. Two
                                    different RSA algorithms are supported by the TOE, namely the "Simple Straight Forward
                                    Method" (called RSA "straight forward", the key consists of the pair n and d) and RSA
                                    using the "Chinese Remainder Theorem" (RSA CRT, the key consists of the quintuple p,
                                    q, dp, dq, qInv).
                                    Attack resistance for this security functionality is discussed in Security architectural
