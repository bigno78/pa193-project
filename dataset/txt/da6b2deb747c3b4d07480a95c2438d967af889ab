                 1.2 TOE Overview
                      The TOE consists of the Micro Controller and a software stack which is stored on the
                      Micro Controller and which can be executed by the Micro Controller. The software stack
                      can be further split into the following components:
                      • Firmware for booting and low level functionality of the Micro Controller (MC FW)
                        like writing to flash memory. This includes software for implementing cryptographic
                        operations, called Crypto Library.
                      • Software for implementing a Java Card Virtual Machine [15], a Java Card Runtime
                        Environment [16] and a Java Card Application Programming Interface [14], called
                        JCVM, JCRE and JCAPI.
                      • Software for implementing content management according to GlobalPlatform [17],
                        called GlobalPlatform (GP) Framework.
                      • Software for executing native libraries, called Secure Box.
                      The TOE is referred to as JCOP 4.7 SE051. The JCOP 4 Operating System (JCOP 4
                      OS) consists of the software stack without the Crypto Library (Crypto Lib) and without
                      the Micro Controller Firmware (MC FW). The TOE uses one or more communication
                      interfaces to communicate with its environment.
                      The complete TOE is depicted in Figure 1. The elements are described in more detail in
                      Section 1.3 "TOE Description".

 Figure 1. Components of the TOE

                               Figure 1 shows the components of the TOE. The TOE is a composite product on top
                               of CC certified Hardware, Firmware and Crypto Library. Part of the TOE are the JCVM,
                               JCRE, JCAPI and the GP Framework. Also included is optional functionality and the
                               Secure Box mechanism. The Secure Box Native Librarys provide native functions for
                               untrusted third parties and are not part of the TOE.
                               The figure shows Java Card applets which are small programs in Java language that can
                               be executed by the TOE, but are not part of the TOE.

                     1.2.1 Usage and Major Security Features of the TOE
                               The usage of the TOE is focused on security critical applications in small form factors.
                               One main usage scenario is the use of so called smart cards. Examples of such cards
                               are banking cards or electronic drivers’ licenses. The TOE can also be used in an
                               electronic passport. Another usage scenario is device authentication, where the TOE can
                               be used to prove the authenticity or originality of a device like an accessory for a gaming
                               console.
                               The TOE provides a variety of security features. The hardware of the Micro Controller
                               already protects against logical and physical attacks by applying various sensors to
                               detect manipulations and by processing data in ways which protect against leakage
                               of data by side channel analysis. With the software stack the TOE provides many

                 1.2.2 TOE Type
                      The TOE is a Java Card with a GP Framework. It can be used to load and execute off-
                      card verified Java Card applets.

                 1.2.3 Required non-TOE Hardware/Software/Firmware
                      Three groups of users shall be distinguished here.
                      The first group is the end-users group, which uses the TOE with one or more loaded
                      applets in the final form factor like a banking card or an electronic passport. These users
                      only require a communication device to be able to communicate with the TOE. The
                      communication protocol of the TOE is standardized in either ISO7816 [31] (T=1, T=0),
                      ISO14443 [32] (T=CL), or UM10204 [33] (I2C Slave).
                      The second group of users are administrators of cards. They want to configure the
                      card by using the Configuration Module, to install additional applets and to configure and
                      personalise these applets. These users require the same equipment as end-users.
                      The third group of users wants to develop Java Card applets and execute them on
                      the TOE. These applet developers need in addition to the communication device a
                      set of tools for the development of applets. This set of tools can be obtained from the
                      TOE vendor and comprises elements such as PC development environment, byte code
                      verifier, compiler, linker and debugger.

                     1.3 TOE Description

                    1.3.1 TOE Components and Composite Certification
                           The certification of this TOE is a composite certification. The following sections provide
                           a more detailed description of the components of Figure 1. It is also made clear whether
                           a component is covered by a previous certification or whether it is covered in the
                           certification of this TOE.

                  1.3.1.1 Micro Controller

                           The Micro Controller is a secure smart card controller from NXP’s SmartMX3 family.
                           The Micro Controller contains a co-processor for symmetric cryptographic operations,
                           supporting DES and AES, as well as an accelerator for asymmetric cryptographic
                           algorithms. The Micro Controller further contains a physical random number generator.
                           The supported memory technologies are volatile (Random Access Memory (RAM)) and
                           non-volatile (Read Only Memory (ROM) and FLASH) memory.
                           Access to all memory types is controlled by a Memory Management Unit (MMU) which
                           allows to separate and restrict access to parts of the memory.
                           The Micro Controller has been certified in a previous certification and the results are re-
                           used for this certification. The exact reference to the previous certification is given in the
                           following Table 2 "Reference to Certified Micro Controller":

                           Table 2. Reference to Certified Micro Controller

                                                                          [1]

                           Certification ID                BSI-DSZ-CC-1040
                           Reference                       [10]

                           [1]   The SE051 hardware is an instantiation of the N7121 hard macro with I2C side-car.


                  1.3.1.2 Security IC Dedicated Software

                 1.3.1.2.1 MC FW (Micro Controller Firmware)

                           The Micro Controller Firmware is used for testing of the Micro Controller at production,
                           for booting of the Micro Controller after power-up or after reset, for configuration of
                           communication devices and for writing data to volatile and non-volatile memory.
                           The MC FW has been certified together with the Micro Controller and the same reference
                           [10] as given for the Micro Controller also apply for the MC FW.

                 1.3.1.2.2 Crypto Library

                           The Crypto Library provides implementations for symmetric and asymmetric
                           cryptographic operations, hashing, the generation of hybrid deterministic and hybrid
                           physical random numbers and further functions like secure copy and compare.
                           Some of the cryptographic algorithms offered by the Crypto Lib are not certified, see
                           Section 1.3.1.4 "Excluded functionality".
                           The symmetric cryptographic operations comprise the algorithms 3DES and AES. These
                           algorithms use the symmetric co-processor of the Micro Controller.

                          The supported asymmetric cryptographic operations are ECC and RSA. These
                          algorithms use the Public Key Crypto Coprocessor (PKCC) of the Micro Controller for the
                          cryptographic operations.
                          The Crypto Library has been certified together with the Micro Controller and the same
                          reference [10] as given for the Micro Controller also applies.

                  1.3.1.3 Security IC Embedded Software

                 1.3.1.3.1 JCOP 4.7 SE051

                          The OS of the TOE consists of JCVM, JCRE, JCAPI and GP framework. It is
                          implemented according to the Java Card Specification and GlobalPlatform. Additionally it
                          consists of a proprietary API, which is described in the UGM [9].
                          The TOE can be identified by using the IDENTIFY APDU command (see UGM [9]). This
                          command returns the card identification data, which includes a Platform ID, a Patch ID
                          and other information that allows to identify the content in ROM, FLASH and loaded
                          patches (if any).
                          The TOE also includes a Configuration Module (see Section 1.3.2 "Optional TOE
                          Functionality") which is used for personalisation and configuration of the TOE. It must be
                          deleted after the personalisation is finished (end of Phase 6 ”Personalisation”) by using
                          the DELETE APDU command. Once the Configuration Module is deleted, it is no longer
                          possible to configure the TOE.
                          The TOE contains further functionality for integrity protection of user data via an
                          EDC, encryption of user data via PUF [12] and optional functionality as described in
                          Section 1.3.2 "Optional TOE Functionality".

                  1.3.1.4 Excluded functionality

                          All Secure Box Native Libraries are not part of the TOE. No security functional
                          requirements are claimed on AES CCM, HMAC, HKDF, ECDAA, elliptic curve
                          cryptography based on Edwards and Montgomery curves and FIPS self-tests, they are

                  1.3.3 TOE Reduced Feature Set
                        The TOE is also available to customers with a reduced feature set. This variant of the
                        TOE contains a different base mask configuraton and has some features removed from
                        the TOE. The removed features are:
                        •   No support for SecureBox
                        •   No RSA support in GP
                        •   No DES support in GP
                        •   SCP01 not supported
                        •   SCP02 not supported
                        •   GP CVM service not supported
                        •   GP command chaining is not supported
                        •   ISO 7816 T=1, T=0 (UART) interface not supported
                        The base mask with the reduced feature set is known as IOT Reduced, while the base
                        mask with full functionality is known as IOT Full. For more information on the difference
                        in feature set, please refer to Table 3.1 in the User Guidance and Administration Manual
                        [9].

                 1.3.3.1 Reduced Security Functional Requirements

                        Some security functionality claimed in this Security Target is no longer available in the
                        IOT Reduced base mask or has limited functionality and the corresponding Security
                        Functional Requirements are not (completely) applicable for this variant of the TOE. The

                      The evaluation process is limited to phases 1 to 5. User Applet development is outside
                      the scope of this evaluation. Applets can be loaded into FLASH in phases 3, 4, 5, and 6.
                      Applet loading in phase 7 is also allowed. This means post-issuance loading of applets
                      can be done for a certified TOE.
                      The Configuration Module is loaded into FLASH and has special privileges to personalize
                      and configure the TOE. Before life cycle Phase 7 "Operational Use" the Configuration
                      Module is deleted and hence it is ensured that its functionality cannot be used
                      afterwards. It is possible to load patch code into FLASH in phases 3, 4, 5, and 6. The
                      certification is only valid for the ROM code having the Platform Identifiers and the Patch
                      IDs (if applicable) as stated in Table 5 "Delivery Items".
                      The delivery process from NXP to their customers (to phase 4 or phase 5 of the life
                      cycle) guarantees that the customer is aware of the exact versions of the different parts
                      of the TOE as outlined above.

                         DIAG, A.USE_KEYS) that users handle securely the TOE and related Objectives for the
                         environment are defined (OE.USE_DIAG, OE.USE_KEYS).

                 1.3.5.2 TOE Identification

                         The TOE can be identified by using the Platform ID, the FLASH ID and the Patch ID. The
                         IDENTIFY command and the identification output for this TOE are described in detail
                         in Chapter 2 of the UGM [9]. The IDENTIFY command also returns information about
                         presence of optional functionality and allows to identify the IOT Full and IOT Reduced
                         base mask configuration.

                  1.3.6 Evaluated Package Types
                         A number of package types are supported for this TOE. All package types, which are
                         covered by the certification of the used hardware (see [10]), are also allowed to be used
                         in combination with each product of this TOE.
                         The package types do not influence the security functionality of the TOE. They only
                         define which pads are connected in the package and for what purpose and in which
                         environment the chip can be used. Note that the security of the TOE is not dependent on

2       Conformance Claims (ASE_CCL)
                      This Chapter is divided into the following sections: "CC Conformance Claim", "Package
                      Claim", "PP Claim", and "Conformance Claim Rationale".

                  2.1 CC Conformance Claim
                      This Security Target claims to be conformant to version 3.1 of Common Criteria for
                      Information Technology Security Evaluation according to
                      • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 1, Version 3.1,
                        Revision 5, April 2017" [1]
                      • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 2, Version 3.1,
                        Revision 5, April 2017" [2]
                      • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 3, Version 3.1,
                        Revision 5, April 2017" [3]
                      The following methodology will be used for the evaluation:
                      • Common Methodology for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Evaluation
                        Methodology, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April 2017" [4]
                      This Security Target claims to be CC Part 2 extended and CC Part 3 conformant.
                      The extended Security Functional Requirements are defined in Section 6 "Extended
                      Components Definition (ASE_ECD)".

                  2.2 Package Claim
                      This Security Target claims conformance to the assurance package EAL6. The
                      augmentation to EAL6 is ASE_TSS.2 “TOE summary specification with architectural
                      design summary” and ALC_FLR.1 “Basic flaw remediation”.

                  2.3 PP Claim
                      The Security Target claims demonstrable conformance to the Java Card System -
                      Open Configuration Protection Profile, December 2017, Version 3.0.5 [6], certified by
                      Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI, BSI-CC-PP-0099-2017). The
                      Java Card Protection Profile makes the use of Java Card RMI optional. The TOE does
                      not support Java Card RMI. This ST is more restrictive than the PP [6] which Section 2.4
                      "Conformance Claim Rationale" provides a rational for.

                  2.4 Conformance Claim Rationale

                 2.4.1 TOE Type
                      The TOE type as stated in Section Section 1.2 "TOE Overview" of this ST corresponds
                      to the TOE type of the PP as stated in Section 2.1 of [6] namely a Java Card platform,
                      implementing the Java Card Specification Version 3.0.5 [15], [16], [14].

                  2.4.2 SPD Statement

                 2.4.2.1 Threats

                         The Security Problem Definition (SPD) statement that is presented in Section 4 "Security
                         Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)" includes the threats as presented in the PP [6], but also
                         includes additional threats. These threats are:
                         •   T.OS_OPERATE
                         •   T.RND
                         •   T.COM_EXPLOIT
                         •   T.LIFE_CYCLE
                         •   T.UNAUTHORIZED_CARD_MNGT
                         •   T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA[REFINED]
                         •   T.CONFIG
                         •   T.SEC_BOX_BORDER
                         •   T.MODULE_EXEC
                         •   T.MODULE_REPLACEMENT
                         The threat T.OS_OPERATE is an additional threat added to cover incorrect operating
                         system behavior, it is an addition to the threats in the PP [6].
                         The threat T.RND is taken from the Security IC PP [5].
                         The threat T.COM_EXPLOIT is included to cover communication channels attacks and it
                         is an addition to the threats in the PP [6].
                         The threat T.LIFE_CYCLE is included to cover content management attacks and it is an
                         addition to the threats in the PP [6].
                         The threat T.UNAUTHORIZED_CARD_MNGT refines the threats T.INSTALL and
                         T.DELETION from the Security IC PP [5].
                         The threat T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA[REFINED] refines the threat T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA in
                         the Security IC PP [5].
                         The threat T.CONFIG is an additional threat to cover unauthorized modifications and
                         read access of the configuration area in the TOE. It is an addition to the threats defined in
                         the PP [6].
                         The threat T.SEC_BOX_BORDER is included for the Secure Box which is additional
                         functionality the PP [6] allows.
                         The threats T.MODULE_EXEC and T.MODULE_REPLACEMENT are included for the
                         Modular Design which is additional functionality the PP [6] allows. Furthermore some
                         threats from the PP [6] are refined to cover additional assets from the Modular Design.
                         This comprises threats T.CONFID-JCS-CODE, T.CONFID-JCS-DATA, T.INTEG-APPLI-
                         CODE, T.INTEG-JCS-CODE, T.INTEG-JCS-DATA, and T.SID.1.
                         Note that the threat T.EXE-CODE-REMOTE is not included, since the TOE does not
                         support Java Card RMI. The Java Card Protection Profile [6] makes the use of Java Card
                         RMI optional.

                        The OSP OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS is introduced for the SD feature of the TOE and is
                        an addition to the OSPs in PP [6].
                        The OSP.SECURE-BOX is introduced to allow execution of third party native code and is
                        an addition to the OSPs in PP [6].

                 2.4.2.3 Assumptions

                        The SPD statement includes two of the three assumptions from the PP [6]. The
                        assumption A.Deletion is excluded. The Card Manager is part of the TOE and therefore
                        the assumption is no longer relevant. Leaving out the assumption, makes the SPD of this
                        ST more restrictive than the SPD in the PP [6]. As the Card Manager is part of the TOE,
                        it is ensuring that the deletion of applets through the Card Manager is secure, instead of
                        assuming that it is handled by the Card Manager in the environment of the TOE.
                        Besides the assumptions from the PP [6], following additional assumptions are added:
                        •   A.PROCESS-SEC-IC
                        •   A.USE_DIAG
                        •   A.USE_KEYS
                        •   A.APPS-PROVIDER
                        •   A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY
                        The assumption A.PROCESS-SEC-IC is taken from the underlying certified Micro
                        Controller [10], which is compliant to the Security IC PP [5].
                        The assumptions A.USE_DIAG and A.USE_KEYS are included because the Card
                        Manager is part of the TOE and no longer part of the environment.
                        The assumptions A.APPS-PROVIDER and A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY are added
                        because Security Domains from the GlobalPlatform Specification are introduced. All the
                        applets and packages are signed by the Application Provider Security Domain (APSD)
                        and the correctness is verified on the TOE by Verification Authority Security Domain
                        (VASD) before the package or applet is installed or loaded. A.APPS-PROVIDER and
                        A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY are additions to PP [6] for card content management
                        environment.

                  2.4.3 Security Objectives Statement
                        The statement of security objectives in the ST presented in Section 5 "Security
                        Objectives" includes all security objectives as presented in the PP [6], but also includes a
                        number of additional security objectives. These security objectives are:
                        • OT.IDENTIFICATION
                        • OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS
                        • OT.APPLI-AUTH

                      •   OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION
                      The security objective OT.IDENTIFICATION is part of the security objectives of the
                      certified Micro Controller [10] (see also Section 1.3.1.1 "Micro Controller") and Crypto
                      Lib [10] (see also Section 1.3.1.2.2 "Crypto Library"), which are also components of this
                      composite certification. Therefore the security objective statement is equivalent to the PP
                      [6] for these two security objectives. OT.IDENTIFICATION is also included for the pre-
                      personalisation feature of the TOE, which is additional functionality the PP allows.
                      The security objectives OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS, OT.APPLI-AUTH, OT.COMM_AUTH,
                      OT.COMM_INTEGRITY, OT.COMM_CONFIDENTIALITY are objectives for the TOE as
                      the GlobalPlatform API and the definitions for Secure Channel, Security Domains and
                      Card Content Management are used from it.
                      The security objectives OT.CARD-CONFIGURATION, OT.SECURE_LOAD_ACODE,
                      OT.SECURE_ACTIVATION_ADDITIONAL_CODE, OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION are
                      related to the configuration of the TOE via the Configuration Module, which is additional
                      functionality the PP [6] allows.
                      The security objective OT.SEC_BOX_FW is related to the Secure Box, which is
                      additional functionality the PP allows.
                      The security objective OT.SID_MODULE is related to the Modular Design of the TOE,
                      which is additional functionality the PP [6] allows.
                      The security objective OT.RNG is related to the Random Number Generator, and is
                      taken from the Security IC PP [5].
                      The ST contains OE.APPLET, OE.VERIFICATION and OE.CODE-EVIDENCE from
                      Security Objectives for the Operational Environment from [6]. Additionally, some of the
                      Security Objectives for the Operational Environment from [6] are listed as TOE Security

                          Dependencies:                    No dependencies.

1.3 TOE Overview
The Security Target (ST) defines the security objectives and requirements for a
contact or contactless based chip of machine readable travel documents (MRTD)
based on the requirements and recommendations of the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO), EU requirements for biometric European passport
(Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 and Commission Implementing Decision
6181) and Biometric European Resident Permit (REGULATION (EU) 2017/1954
and Commission Implementing Decision 6178). This product is intended to
enable verification of the authenticity of the travel document and to identify its
holder during a border control, using an inspection system. The verification
process is based on Extended Access Control with Password Authenticated
Connection Establishment (PACE) and optionally Active Authentication (AA).

The main features and their origin are the following:
 Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
   according to ICAO Technical Report “Supplemental Access Control” [ICAO-
   9303] part 11 and strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0068-V2 [PACE-PP] for
   protection of the communication between terminal and chip. The following
   PACE mapping modes are supported and covered by the TOE:
      o    Generic Mapping (PACE-GM)
      o    Integrated Mapping (PACE-IM)
      o    Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM), which combines PACE-GM
           with Chip Authentication into a single protocol.

    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    travel document’s chip to the inspection system.
   Terminal Authentication v1
    according to BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1], [TR-03110-3] and
    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    inspection system to travel document’s chip and protects the confidentiality
    and integrity of the sensitive biometric reference data during their
    transmission from the TOE to the inspection system.

As a feature that can be optionally configured the TOE supports:
   Active Authentication
    which according to [ICAO-9303] prevents copying the SOD and proves that it
    has been read from the authentic chip. It proves that the chip has not been
    substituted.


   Polymorphic Authentication
    which according to [PCA-eMRTD] provides additional privacy by randomisation
    of returned Polymorphic Identities, Polymorphic Pseudonyms and
    Complementary Polymorphic ID attributes in combination with standard ICAO
    and EAC1 eMRTD protocols specified in ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] and BSI
    TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1] and [TR 03110-3].

The TOE may also be used as an ISO driving license, compliant to ISO/IEC 18013
or ISO/IEC TR 19446 supporting PACE, AA and CA, as both applications (MRTD
and IDL) share the same protocols and data structure organization. Therefore, in
the rest of the document, the word “MRTD” MAY be understood either as a MRTD
in the sense of ICAO, or a driving license compliant to ISO/IEC 18013 or ISO/IEC
TR 19446 depending on the targeted usage envisioned by the issuer.

Application note
This TOE claims an assurance level EAL5 augmented with AVA_VAN.5 and
ALC_DVS.2. AVA_VAN.5 implies that the TOE is resistant to attacks performed by
an attacker possessing "High attack potential".
Not all key sizes specified in this security target have sufficient cryptographic
strength for satisfying the AVA_VAN.5 “high attack potential”. In order to be
protected against attackers with a "high attack potential", sufficiently large
cryptographic key sizes SHALL be configured for this TOE. References can be
found in national and international document standards. Further details have
been specified in the TOE’s guidance documentation [AGD_PRE].

[TR-03110] have also been refered to in ISO18013 for EU driving licences. The
BAP-1 protocol defined in ISO18013 is equal to Basic Access Protocol (BAC)
defined in [ICAO-9303]. As to the logical data structure, the ISO18013 uses the
same concept of Passive Authentication defined in [ICAO-9303], but specifies
different ISO7816-4 elementary file identifiers for storing the ICAO defined
content of DG3, DG4 and DG15.

1.4.2.1 ICAO/EAC eMRTD and ISO Driving licence
This sub section explains the TOE security features for operational use of TOE
configured as ICAO/EAC eMRTD or as Driving Licence.

A State or Organisation issues travel documents to be used by the holder for
international travel. The traveller presents a travel document to the inspection
system to prove his or her identity. The travel document in context of this
Security Target contains:
  I.  visual (eye readable) biographical data and portrait of the holder,
 II.  a separate data summary (MRZ data) for visual and machine reading using
       OCR methods in the Machine readable zone (MRZ) and
III.  data elements on the travel document’s chip according to LDS in case of
       contactless machine reading.

The authentication of the traveller is based on:
  I.  the possession of a valid travel document personalized for a holder with
      the claimed identity as given on the biographical data page and
 II.  biometrics using the reference data stored in the travel document.

The issuing State or Organization ensures the authenticity of the data of genuine
travel documents. The receiving State trusts a genuine travel document of an
issuing State or Organization.

For this Security Target the travel document is viewed as unit of:
(i) the physical part of the travel document in form of paper and/or plastic
    and chip. It presents visual readable data including (but not limited to)
    personal data of the travel document holder
    (a) the biographical data on the biographical data page of the travel
         document surface,
    (b) the printed data in the Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) and
    (c) the printed portrait.

(ii) the logical travel document as data of the travel document holder stored
     according to the Logical Data Structure as defined in [ICAO-9303] as specified
     by ICAO on the contact based or contactless integrated circuit. It presents
     contact based / contactless readable data including(but not limited to)
     personal data of the travel document holder
     (a) the digital Machine Readable Zone Data (digital MRZ data, EF.DG1),
     (b) the digitized portraits (EF.DG2),
     (c) the biometric reference data of finger(s) (EF.DG3) or iris image(s)
          (EF.DG4) or both1,
     (d) the other data according to LDS (EF.DG5 to EF.DG16) and
     (e) the Document Security Object (SOD).


The issuing State or Organisation implements security features of the travel
document to maintain the authenticity and integrity of the travel document and
their data. The physical part of the travel document and the travel document’s
chip are identified by the Document Number.

The physical part of the travel document is protected by physical security
measures (e.g. watermark, security printing), logical (e.g. authentication keys of
the travel document’s chip) and organisational security measures (e.g. control of
materials, personalisation procedures) [ICAO-9303].These security measures can
include the binding of the travel document’s chip to the travel document.

The logical travel document is protected in authenticity and integrity by a digital
signature created by the document signer acting for the issuing State or
Organisation and the security features of the travel document’s chip.

The ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] defines the baseline security methods Passive
Authentication, advanced security access methods Basic Access Control (BAC)
and Password Authenticated Connection Establishment to the logical travel



These biometric reference data are optional according to [ICAO-9303]. This ST assumes that the issuing State or
1

Organisation uses this option and protects these data by means of extended access control.

document, Active Authentication of the travel document’s chip, Extended Access
Control and the Data Encryption of sensitive biometrics as optional security
measure. The Passive Authentication Mechanism is performed completely and
independently of the TOE by the TOE environment.

The BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1] and [TR 03110-3] specify the
Extended Access Control protocols Chip Authentication version 1 (CAv1) and
Terminal Authentication (TAv1), which are required to get secured access to the
biometric data stored in data groups DG3 and DG4 in combination with PACE or
BAC.

This Security Target addresses the protection of the logical travel document:
   (i) in integrity by write-only-once access control and by physical means, and
   (ii) in confidentiality by the Extended Access Control Mechanism.

This Security Target addresses the Chip Authentication Version 1 described in
[TR-03110-1] and PACE-CAM described in [ICAO-9303] part 11 as an alternative
to the Active Authentication stated in [ICAO-9303].

For Basic Access Control (BAC) supported by the product, a separate evaluation
and certification is performed with ST [ST-BAC].

The confidentiality by Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
is a mandatory security feature of the TOE. The travel document shall strictly
conform to the ‘Common Criteria Protection Profile Machine Readable Travel
Document using Standard Inspection Procedure with PACE [PACE-PP]. Note that
[PACE-PP] considers high attack potential.

For the PACE protocol according to [ICAO-9303] part 11, the following steps shall
be performed:
 (i) the travel document's chip encrypts a nonce with the shared password,
       derived from the MRZ resp. CAN data and transmits the encrypted nonce
       together with the domain parameters to the terminal.
 (ii) The terminal recovers the nonce using the shared password, by
       (physically) reading the MRZ or CAN data. This nonce shall be converted to
       a group generator using one of the following mapping algorithms, which
       maps a static generator to an ephemeral generator:
           a. Generic mapping (PACE-GM) or
           b. Integrated mapping PACE-IM)
 (iii) The travel document's chip and terminal computer perform a Diffie-
       Hellmann key agreement together with the ephemeral domain parameters
       to create a shared secret. Both parties derive the session keys KMAC and
       KENC from the shared secret.
 (iv) Each party generates an authentication token, sends it to the other party
       and verifies the received token.

In case of PACE with Chip Authenticated Mapping (PACE-CAM), in addition to the
steps above executed for the PACE-GM variant, the MRTD chip computes Chip
Authentication Data CAIC, encrypts them AIC = E(KSEnc, CAIC) and sends them

to the terminal. The terminal decrypts AIC and verifies the authenticity of the
chip using the recovered Chip Authentication Data CAIC.

After successful key negotiation, the terminal and the travel document's chip
provide private communication (secure messaging) [TR-03110-1], [ICAO-9303].

This Security Target requires the TOE to implement the Extended Access Control
as defined in [TR-03110-1]. The Extended Access Control consists of two parts:
  (i) the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1 and
  (ii) the Terminal Authentication Protocol Version 1 (v.1).

The Chip Authentication Protocol v.1
  (i) authenticates the travel document’s chip to the inspection system and
  (ii) establishes secure messaging which is used by Terminal Authentication v.1
       to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the sensitive biometric
       reference data during their transmission from the TOE to the inspection
       system. Therefore Terminal Authentication v.1 can only be performed if
       Chip Authentication v.1has been successfully executed.

The Terminal Authentication Protocolv.1 consists of
  (i) the authentication of the inspection system as entity authorized by the
       receiving State or Organisation through the issuing State, and
  (ii) an access control by the TOE to allow reading the sensitive biometric
       reference data only to successfully authenticated authorized inspection
       systems.

The Active Authentication protocol may be optionally configured during
personalisation.

The issuing State or Organisation authorizes the receiving State by means of
certification the authentication public keys of Document Verifiers who create
Inspection System Certificates.


1.4.2.2 Polymorphic eMRTD

In addition to an ICAO/EAC eMRTD functionality, the TOE supports Polymorphic
eMRTD extensions that can be configured using the same applet during
personalisation. The TOE’s Polymorphic eMRTD extensions enable secure
authentication with enhanced privacy protection features. The Polymorphic
extensions provide the holder the possibility to authenticate towards a service
provider using an authentication service in a non-traceable and non-linkable
manner thanks to usage of Polymorphic ID attributes.

The Polymorphic extensions are used to configure a Polymorphic eMRTD as stand
alone application instance or next to an ICAO/EAC eMRTD/Driving application
licence instance having its own application identifier during personalisation.

                        eMRTD Configuration)

The Polymorphic eMRTD uses the same ICAO and EAC1 protocols like PACEv2,
Chip Authentication v1 (CAv1) and Terminal Authentication (v1) as defined in
[ICAO-9303], [TR-03110-1] and [TR-03110-3]. The TOE’s Polymorphic eMRTD
extensions provide the following features:

      Secure storage of the Polymorphic ID attributes during personalisation or
       the TOE.
      Polymorphic Authentication Protocol (PMA) for authenticated access with
       user consent, randomization and secure readout of the Polymorphic ID
       attributes, in combination with PACEv2 and EAC1 eMRTD protocols.
      PACEv2 protocol extended with PIN and PUK passwords, to enforce user
       authentication (document holder verification) in compliance with [TR-
       03101-3].

For Polymorphic eMRTD, the PACE protocol is configured with PIN, PUK and CAN
passwords in compliance with [TR-03110-3] during personalisation. Only PACE-
GM and PACE-IM are configurable for a Polymorphic eMRTD.

The Active Authentication protocol shall not be configured for a polymorphic
eMRTD.

The logical data structure consists only of EF.CVCA, DG14 and EF.SOD. In order
to assure a sufficient level of privacy during authentication the CAv1 private key
and EF.SOD are shared amoung a sufficient high number of personalised
Polymorphic eMRTDs, i.e. the logical data structure does not contain any unique
identifiable data.



1.4.3 TOE life cycle
The TOE life cycle is described in terms of its four life cycle phases. (With respect
to the [SIC-PP], the TOE life-cycle is additionally subdivided into 7 steps in the
ST. These steps are denoted too in the following although the sequence of the
steps differs for the TOE life cycle).

1.4.3.1 Phase 1 “Development”
(Step1) The TOE is developed in phase 1. The IC developer develops the
integrated circuit, the IC Dedicated Software and the guidance documentation
associated with these TOE components.
The IC developer also acts as the developer of the embedded software (operating
system), which is the NXP JCOP 3 P60.

(Step2) The software developer uses the guidance documentation for the
integrated circuit and the guidance documentation for relevant parts of the NXP
JCOP 3 P60 and develops the ePassport application and the guidance
documentation associated with this TOE component.

The ePassport application (i.e. the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
(SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet run time code) may be
integrated either in ROM or in EEPROM of the chip. Depending on the intention:
      (a) the ePassport application is securely delivered directly from the
          software developer (IDEMIA development dept.) to the IC manufacturer
          (NXP). The applet code will be integrated into the ROM mask code or
          inEEPROM by the IC manufacturer, or
      (b) the ePassport application is securely delivered directly from the
          software developer (IDEMIA development dept.) to the travel document
          manufacturer (IDEMIA production dept.) .) for loading in EEPROM.

Notice that the guidance documentation of the ePassport application is always
securely delivered directly from the software developer (IDEMIA development
dept.) to the travel document manufacturer (IDEMIA production dept.).


1.4.3.2 Phase 2 “Manufacturing”
(Step3) In a first step the TOE integrated circuit is produced containing the travel
document’s chip Dedicated Software, the parts of the travel document’s chip
Embedded Software and in case of alternative a) the ePassport application in
ROM or in EEPROM.

The IC manufacturer writes the IC Identification Data onto the chip to control the
IC as travel document material during the IC manufacturing and the delivery
process to the travel document manufacturer. The IC is securely delivered from
the IC manufacturer to the travel document manufacturer.

                           eMRTD Configuration)

If necessary the IC manufacturer adds the parts of the IC Embedded Software in
the non-volatile programmable memories (for instance EEPROM).

(Step4 optional) The travel document manufacturer combines the IC with
hardware for the contact based / contactless interface in the travel document
unless the travel document consist of the chip only.

(Step5) The travel document manufacturer
  i.  adds the IC Embedded Software or part of it in the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM) if necessary and in case
      of alternative (b), loads the ePassport application into the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM),
 ii.      creates the ePassport application and
iii.      equips travel document’s chips with pre-personalization Data.

EAC PP Application Note 1: Creation of the application for this TOE implies
Applet instantiation.

For this Security Target the following name mappings to the protection profile
[EAC-PP-V2] apply:
    IC Dedicated SW = Low level IC libraries
    travel document’s chip Embedded Software = NXP JCOP 3 P60 operating
       system.
    ePassport application = IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
       (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet run time code or an
       instantiation of it.
    Pre-personalization Data = Personalization Agent Key Set, Card Production
       Life Cycle (CPLC) data and buffer settings.

Both the underlying platform and IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
(SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet provide configuration and
life-cycle management functions required for TOE preparation. TOE preparation
steps are performed in manufacturing phase and consist of the following 2
activities:
    1. Platform initialisation
       2. Pre-personalisation

Platform initialisation
Platform initialisation consists of the configuration of the NXP JCOP 3 P60 in
accordance with requirements specified in the platform administrator guidance
[PLTF-PRE] by using the dedicated platform commands. Furthermore the Pre-
Personalisation Agent key set is installed and (a part of) the CPLC data is
updated. To prevent unattended tracing of the MRTD document, the NXP JCOP 3
P60 is configured such that unauthenticated access to any platform unique
idenfiable data is not possible.

                              eMRTD Configuration)

Pre-personalisation
The pre-personalisation consists of the following steps:
   a. IC (chip) Authentication and getting chip access with the pre-
      personalisation key set.
   b. [optional] In case the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
      (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet runtime code does
      not reside in ROM, it is loaded into EEPROM.
   c. Install the applet application instances depending on the desired TOE
      configuration specified in section 1.4.2, using IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with
      Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet.
   d. Set the ePassport (and if present) the Polymorphic eMRTD applet
      irreversibly in its PERSONALISATION life-cycle state by installation of the
      Personalisation Agent specific personalisation key set(s).

During step (c) the CPLC data with the IC Identifier as well as the other pre-
personalisation data is configured in the TOE. The last step (d) finalizes the TOE.
This is the moment the TOE starts to exist and is ready for delivery to the
Personalisation Agent. The guidance documentation for the Personalisation Agent

1.4.3.3 Phase 3 “Personalisation of the travel document”
(Step 6) The personalisation of the travel document includes
  i.  the survey of the MRTD holder’s biographical data,
 ii.   the enrolment of the MRTD holder biometric reference data (i.e. the
       digitized portraits and the optional biometric reference data),
iii.   the printing of the visual readable data onto the physical MRTD,
iv.    the writing of the TOE User Data and TSF Data into the logical MRTD and
 v.    configuration of the TSF if necessary.

The step (iv) is performed by the Personalisation Agent and includes but is not
limited to the creation of:
  i.   the digital MRZ data (EF.DG1),
 ii.   the digitized portrait (EF.DG2), and
iii.   the Document security object.

The signing of the Document security object by the Document signer [ICAO-
9303] finalizes the personalisation of the genuine travel document for the travel
document holder. The personalised travel document (together with appropriate
guidance (AGD_OPE) for TOE usage if necessary) is handed over to the travel
document holder for operational use.

The personalisation of Polymorphic eMRTD application instance includes:

 i.    establishing the identity of the polymorphic eMRTD document holder,
 ii.   Requesting the required Polymorphic eMRTD ID attributes from the central
       Key Management authority,
iii.   writing Polymorphic ID attributes, Polymorphic LDS data as defined in
       [PCA-eMRTD],
iv.    writing the TSF data (PIN, PUK, CAv1 private key) as defined in [PCA-
       eMRTD],
 v.    signing the Document Security Object defined in
       [ICAO-9303] (in the role of DS).


The signing of the Document security object by the Document signer [ICAO-
9303] finalizes the personalisation of the genuine Polymorphic eMRTD document
for the travel document holder. The personalised Polymorphic eMRTD document
(together with appropriate guidance (AGD_OPE) for TOE usage if necessary) is
handed over to the Polymorphic eMRTD document holder for operational use.

Authentication trust anchor, the effective date and the Chip Authentication
Private Key.

EAC PP Application note 3: This ST distinguishes between the Personalisation
Agent as entity known to the TOE and the Document Signer as entity in the TOE
IT environment signing the Document security object as described in [ICAO-
9303]. This approach allows but does not enforce the separation of these roles.


1.4.3.4 Phase 4 “Operational Use”
(Step 7) The TOE is used as a travel document's chip by the traveller and the
inspection systems in the “Operational Use” phase. The user data can be read
according to the security policy of the issuing State or Organisation and can be
used according to the security policy of the issuing State but they can never be
modified.

EAC PP Application note 42: The intention of the ST is to consider at least the
phases 1 and parts of phase 2 (i.e. Step1 to Step3) as part of the evaluation and
therefore to define the TOE delivery according to CC after this phase. Since
specific production steps of phase 2 are of minor security relevance (e.g. booklet
manufacturing and antenna integration) these are not part of the CC evaluation
under ALC. Nevertheless the decision about this has to be taken by the
certification body resp. the national body of the issuing State or Organisation. In
this case the national body of the issuing State or Organisation is responsible for
these specific production steps.
Note that the personalisation process and its environment may depend on
specific security needs of an issuing State or Organisation. All production,
generation and installation procedures after TOE delivery up to the “Operational
Use” (phase 4) have to be considered in the product evaluation process under
AGD assurance class. Therefore, the Security Target outlines the split up of
P.Manufact, P.Personalisation and the related security objectives into aspects
relevant before vs. after TOE delivery.


1.4.3.5 Non-TOE hardware/software/firmware required by the TOE
There is no explicit non-TOE hardware, software or firmware required by the TOE
to perform its claimed security features. The TOE is defined to comprise the chip
and the complete operating system and application. Note, the inlay holding the
chip as well as the antenna and the booklet (holding the printed MRZ) are
needed to represent a complete travel document. Nevertheless, these parts are
not inevitable for the secure operation of the TOE.




2
 For this ST all steps of both phase 1 and phase 2 are part of the evaluation and therefore define the TOE
delivery according to the CC evaluation after this phase.

2.3 Package Claim
This ST is conforming to assurance package EAL5 augmented with ALC_DVS.2
and AVA_VAN.5 defined in CC part 3 [CC-3].


2.4 PP Conformance Rationale
This ST claims strict conformance to [EAC-PP-V2]. According to hints in [EAC-PP-
V2] parts of the [PACE-PP] have been included into this ST. A detailed
justification is given in the following.


2.4.1 Main aspects
-   The TOE description (chapter 1.3) is based on the TOE definition and TOE
    usage of [EAC-PP, 1.1]. It was enhanced by product specific details.

-   All definitions of the security problem definition in [EAC-PP, 3] have been
    taken exactly from the protection profile in the same wording.

-   All security objectives have been taken exactly from [EAC-PP, 4] in the same
    wording, except for OT.Chip_Auth_Proof which is enhanced to support
    Active Authentication.

-   The part of extended components definition has been taken originally from
    [EAC-PP, 5].

-   All SFRs for the TOE have been taken originally from the [EAC-PP, 6.1] added
    by according iterations, selections and assignments.

-   The security assurance requirements (SARs) have been taken originally from
    the EAC-PP. The requirements are shifted to those of EAL 5+.


2.4.2 Overview of differences between the PP and the ST

The Active Authentication has been added to the TOE. For that:
- One assumption has been added to cover Active Authentication during
   personalization: A.Pers_Agent_AA
- Two security objectives for the environment have been added:
   OE.Auth_Key_MRTD and OE.AA_MRTD. These additions to the original
   objectives of the PP do not contradict with any other objective nor mitigate a
   threat (or part of a threat) meant to be addressed by security objectives for
   the TOE in the PP.
- Three security functional requirements have been added:
              FCS_COP.1/SIG_GEN
                FIA_API.1/AA
                FMT_MTD.1/AAPK

                                                                2018_2000036361

                        eMRTD Configuration)

The additional functionality of Password Authenticated Connection Establishment
with Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM) has been added to the TOE. It
possesses the same security requirements as the PACE functionality, which
means that the same security problem definition is applicable for PACE-CAM.


The following additional SFRs have been defined for PACE-CAM:
              FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM
                FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM
                FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM
                FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM
                FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM
                FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ
                FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_WRITE




The additional functionality of the Polymorphic eMRTD extensions has been
added to the TOE with: (i) additional security problem definition; (ii) additional
security objectives; (iii) additional SFRs. Notice that many SFRs are included
from the [EACv2-PP].

                           eneral support for cryptographic operations needed.

OT.Data_Authenticity The security objective OT.Data_Authenticity aims
  ensuring authenticity of the User- and TSF data (after the PACE
  Authentication) by enabling its verification at the terminal-side and by an
  active verification by the TOE itself. This objective is mainly achieved by
  FTP_ITC.1/PACE using FCS_COP.1/PACE_MAC. A prerequisite for establishing
  this trusted channel is a successful PACE or Chip and Terminal Authentication
  v.1       FIA_UID.1/PACE,       FIA_UAU.1/PACE        (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM,
  FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) using FCS_CKM.1/DH_PACE resp.
  FCS_CKM.1/CA and possessing the special properties FIA_UAU.5/PACE,
  FIA_UAU.6/PACE (FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM, FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM for PACE
  CAM) resp. FIA_UAU.6/EAC. FDP_RIP.1 requires erasing the values of session
  keys (here: for KMAC). FIA_UAU.4/PACE, FIA_UAU.5/PACE and FCS_CKM.4
  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM, FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM and FCS_CKM.4 for PACE
  CAM) represent some required specific properties of the protocols used. The
  SFR FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords, the
  Chip Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication Private Key. The
  SFR FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE
  passwords and the modular invert of the CA key. FMT_MTD.1/PA requires that
  SOD containing signature over the User Data stored on the TOE and used for
  the Passive Authentication is allowed to be written by the Personalisation
  Agent only and, hence, is to be considered as trustworthy. The SFR
  FCS_RND.1 represents a general support for cryptographic operations needed.
  The SFRs FMT_SMF.1 and FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles
  related.

OT.Data_Confidentiality The security objective OT.Data_Confidentiality aims
  that the TOE always ensures confidentiality of the User- and TSF-data stored
  and, after the PACE Authentication resp. Chip Authentication, of these data
  exchanged. This objective for the data stored is mainly achieved by

  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM,        FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM      for   PACE    CAM)    and
  FCS_CKM.4 represent some required specific properties of the protocols used.
  This objective for the data exchanged is mainly achieved by FDP_UCT.1/TRM,
  FDP_UIT.1/TRM and FTP_ITC.1/PACE using FCS_COP.1/PACE_ENC resp.
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC. A prerequisite for establishing this trusted channel is a
  successful PACE or Chip and Terminal Authentication v.1 FIA_UID.1/PACE,
  FIA_UAU.1/PACE (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM, FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE

  special properties FIA_UAU.5/PACE, FIA_UAU.6/PACE (FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM,

  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords, the Chip
  Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication Private Key. The SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords
  and the modular invert of the CA key. FMT_MTD.1/PA requires that SOD
  containing signature over the User Data stored on the TOE and used for the
  Passive Authentication is allowed to be written by the Personalisation Agent
  only and, hence, is to be considered trustworthy. The SFR FCS_RND.1
  represents the general support for cryptographic operations needed. The SFRs
  FMT_SMF.1 and FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related.

OT.Tracing The security objective OT.Tracing aims that the TOE prevents
  gathering TOE tracing data by means of unambiguous identifying the travel
  document remotely through establishing or listening to a communication via
  the contactless/contact-based interface of the TOE without a priori knowledge
  of the correct values of shared passwords (CAN, MRZ, PIN, PUK). This
  objective is achieved as follows:
            1. While establishing PACE communication with CAN, MRZ or PUK
                (non-blocking      authentication /   authorization  data)   by
                FIA_AFL.1/PACE,
            2. while establishing PACE communication using the PIN (blocking
                authentication data) by FIA_AFL.1/Block_PIN,
            3. for listening to PACE communication and for establishing CAv1
                communication by FTP_ITC.1/PACE,
            4. and      for     listening     to  CAv1     communication     by
                FTP_ITC.1/Polymorphic. The trusted channel shall be established
                by performing the PACE, CAv1 and TAv1 protocols according to
                [TR03110TR-03110] and the Polymorphic Authentication protocol
                (PMA).

OT.Prot_Abuse-Func The security objective OT.Prot_Abuse-Func “Protection
  against Abuse of Functionality” is ensured by the SFRs FMT_LIM.1, FMT_LIM.2,
  FMT_LIM.1/POLY and FMT_LIM.2/POLY which prevent misuse of test
  functionality of the TOE or other features which may not be used after TOE
  Delivery.

OT.Prot_Inf_Leak The security objective OT.Prot_Inf_Leak “Protection against
  Information Leakage” requires the TOE to protect confidential TSF data stored
  and/or processed in the travel document’s chip against disclosure
      by measurement and analysis of the shape and amplitude of signals or the
        time between events found by measuring signals on the electromagnetic
        field, power consumption, clock, or I/O lines which is addressed by the
        SFR FPT_EMS.1,
      by forcing a malfunction of the TOE which is addressed by the SFR
        FPT_FLS.1 and FPT_TST.1, and/or
      by a physical manipulation of the TOE which is addressed by the SFR
        FPT_PHP.3.

OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper The security objective OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper “Protection
  against Physical Tampering” is covered by the SFR FPT_PHP.3.

OT.Prot_Malfunction The security objective OT.Prot_Malfunction “Protection
  against Malfunctions” is covered by (i) the SFR FPT_TST.1 which requires self-
  tests to demonstrate the correct operation and tests of authorized users to
  verify the integrity of TSF data and TSF code, and (ii) the SFRFPT_FLS.1 which
  requires a secure state in case of detected failure or operating conditions
  possibly causing a malfunction.

OT.Identification The security objective OT.Identification “Identification of the
  TOE” addresses the storage of Initialisation and Pre-Personalisation Data in its
  non-volatile memory, whereby they also include the IC Identification Data
  uniquely identifying the TOE’s chip. This will be ensured by TSF according to
  SFR FAU_SAS.1. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA allows only the Manufacturer
  to write Initialisation and Pre-personalisation Data (including the
  Personalisation Agent key set). The SFR FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS requires the
  Personalisation Agent to disable access to Initialisation and Pre-personalisation
  Data in the life cycle phase ‘operational use’. The SFRs FMT_SMF.1 and
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related.

OT.AC_Pers The       security   objective  OT.AC_Pers      “Access   Control   for
  Personalisation of logical travel document” addresses the access control of the
  writing the logical travel document. The justification for the SFRs FAU_SAS.1,
  FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA and FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS arises from the justification for
  OT.Identification above with respect to the Pre-personalisation Data. The write
  access to the logical travel document data are defined by the SFR
  FIA_UID.1/PACE (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM), FIA_UAU.1/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM), FDP_ACC.1/TRM and FDP_ACF.1/TRM
  in the same way: only the successfully authenticated Personalisation Agent is
  allowed to write the data of the groups EF.DG1 to EF.DG16 of the logical travel
  document only once. FMT_MTD.1/PA covers the related property of
  OT.AC_Pers (writing SOD and, in generally, personalization data). The SFR
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE lists the roles (including Personalisation Agent) and the SFR
  FMT_SMF.1 lists the TSF management functions (including Personalisation).

  The SFRs FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ (FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ for
  PACE CAM protocol) and FPT_EMS.1 restrict the access to the Personalisation
  Agent Keys, the Chip Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication
  Private key. The authentication of the terminal as Personalisation Agent shall
  be performed by TSF according to SFRs FIA_UAU.4/PACE and FIA_UAU.5/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM and FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). If the
  Personalisation Terminal wants to authenticate itself to the TOE by means of
  the Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 (after Chip Authentication v.1) with
  the Personalisation Agent Keys, the TOE will use TSF according to the
  FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the challenge), FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the
  derivation of the new session keys after Chip Authentication v.1), and
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC (for the ENC_MAC_Mode secure
  messaging), FCS_COP.1/SIG_VER (as part of the Terminal Authentication
  Protocol v.1) and FIA_UAU.6/EAC (for the re-authentication). If the
  Personalisation Terminal wants to authenticate itself to the TOE by means of
  the Authentication Mechanism with the Personalisation Agent Key, the TOE will
  use TSF according to the FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the challenge) and
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC (to verify the authentication attempt). The session keys
  are destroyed according to FCS_CKM.4 after use.

OT.Sens_Data_Conf The            security     objective      OT.Sense_Data_Conf“
  Confidentiality of sensitive biometric reference data” is enforced by the Access
  Control SFP defined in FDP_ACC.1/TRM and FDP_ACF.1/TRM allowing the data
  of EF.DG3 and EF.DG4 only to be read by successfully authenticated Extended
  Inspection System being authorized by a valid certificate according
  FCS_COP.1/SIG_VER. The SFRs FIA_UID.1/PACE and FIA_UAU.1/PACE
  (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM and FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) require the
  identification and authentication of the inspection systems. The SFR
  FIA_UAU.5/PACE requires the successful Chip Authentication (CA) v.1 before
  any     authentication    attempt   as    Extended     Inspection  System    (or
  FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). During the protected communication
  following the CA v.1 the reuse of authentication data is prevented by
  FIA_UAU.4/PACE (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). The SFR
  FIA_UAU.6/EAC and FDP_UCT.1/TRM requires the confidentiality protection of
  the transmitted data after Chip Authentication v.1 by means of secure
  messaging implemented by the cryptographic functions according to
  FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the terminal authentication challenge),
  FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the generation of shared secret and for the derivation of
  the new session keys), and FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC for
  the ENC_MAC_Mode secure messaging. The session keys are destroyed
  according to FCS_CKM.4 after use. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/CAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ requires that the Chip Authentication Key cannot be
  written unauthorized or read afterwards. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/AAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ requires that the Active Authentication Key cannot be
  written       unauthorized       or      read      afterwards.      The     SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_WRITE and FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ

OT.Chip_Auth_Proof The security objective OT.Chip_Auth_Proof “Proof of
  travel document’s chip authenticity” is ensured by the Chip Authentication
  Protocolv.1 provided by FIA_API.1/CA and by Active Authentication provided
  by FIA_API.1/AA proving the identity of the TOE. The Chip Authentication
  Protocolv.1 defined by FCS_CKM.1/CA is performed using a TOE internally
  stored confidential private key as required by FMT_MTD.1/CAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ. The Chip Authentication Protocolv.1 [TR-03110-1]
  requires additional TSF according to FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the derivation of the
  session keys), FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC (for the
  ENC_MAC_Mode        secure    messaging).    The   SFRs     FMT_SMF.1     and
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related. The Active
  Authentication defined by FCS_COP.1/SIG_GEN for the generation of the RSA
  Signature is performed using a TOE internally stored confidential private key
  as required by FMT_MTD.1/AAPK and FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ. According to
  FDP_ACF.1, only the successfully authenticated Inspection Systems are
  allowed to request active authentication (FDP_ACF.1.2, rule 2).

6.3.3.1.1 Rationale for the exclusion of Dependencies


The dependency FMT_MSA.3 of FDP_ACF.1/TRM is discarded. The access
  control TSF according to FDP_ACF.1/TRM uses security attributes which are
  defined during the personalisation and are fixed over the whole life time of the
  TOE. No management of these security attribute (i.e. SFR FMT_MSA.1 and
  FMT_MSA.3) is necessary here.

6.3.4 Rationale for the Security Assurance Requirements
The EAL5 was chosen to permits a developer to gain maximum assurance from
positive security engineering based upon rigorous commercial development
practices supported by moderate application of specialist security engineering
techniques. Such a TOE will probably be designed and developed with the intent
of achieving EAL5 assurance. It is likely that the additional costs attributable to
the EAL5 requirements, relative to rigorous development without the application
of specialised techniques, will not be large.

will be externally available to the user by APDU commands according to the
access conditions specified by the according policies considering the life cycle
state, user role and security state.

7.1.1 SF.IA Identification and Authentication
The different authentication mechanisms are supported by APDU commands and
parameters using the cryptographic functions provided by the platform. The
authentication mechanisms are enforced by protocols and APDU methods as
specified in the functional specification.

Note that Symmetric Basic Access Control (BAC) Authentication Mechanism is
supported by the TOE but not covered by this Security Target.

The TOE supports the following authentication mechanisms:
        SF.IA.1: Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
        SF.IA.2: EAC Chip Authentication v. 1
        SF.IA.3: EAC Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1

                       eMRTD Configuration)

7.1.2 SF.CF Cryptographic functions support
Cryptographic function support is provided by the underlying NXP JCOP 3 P60,
i.e. the TOE relies on the underlying platform for performing its required
cryptographic operations.

SF.CF Cryptographic functions include:
        SF.CF.1: 3DES and AES cipher operations for secure messaging
        SF.CF.2: Digest calculations (SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and
         SHA-512)
        SF.CF.3: Signature generation (ECDSA, RSA)
        SF.CF.4: Signature verification (ECDSA, RSA)
        SF.CF.5: Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement (ECDH and DH)
        SF.CF.6: Key Generation (PACE ECDH/DH ephemeral keys and secure
         messaging MAC and ENC session keys)
        SF.CF.7: Key and secret authentication data Destruction
        SF.CF.8: True Random Number generation
        SF.CF.9: Randomization of PI/PP/CPI data as part of the Polymorphic
         Authentication protocol (PMA)




7.1.3 SF.ILTB Protection against interference, logical tampering
and bypass

SF.ILTB.1
  Protection against interference, logical tampering and bypass
  Security domains are supported by the Java Card platform used by the TOE
  underlying NXP JCOP 3 P60. The NXP JCOP 3 P60 provides protection against
  physical attack and performs self-tests as described in [PLTF-ST].
  The platform protects the TOE against malfunctions that are caused by
  exposure to operating conditions that may cause a malfunction. This includes
  hardware resets and operation outside the specified norms.
  The IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic
  eMRTD Configuration) Applet uses transient memory where a hardware reset
  always reverts the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
  (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet into an unauthenticated
  state.

7.1.4 SF.AC Access control / Storage and protection of logical
travel document data

SF.AC.1
  Access control / Storage and protection of logical travel document
  data
  The TOE provided access control, storage and protection of logical travel
  document data including access control to MRTD data. The TOE implements
  the subjects, objects, security attributes and rules according to the security
  attribute based access control. Access control is enforced by the APDU
  methods as specified in the interface defined in the functional specification.

7.1.5 SF.SM Secure Messaging

SF.SM.1
  Secure Messaging
  Secure messaging MAC and ENC operations are performed by the TOE’s
  platform.
  Secure messaging in ENC_MAC mode is established during PACE or re-
  established during Chip Authentication v1 and is based on SF.CF.1, 5, 6 and 8.

SF.SM.2
  Secure Messaging – Re-authentication
  The Retail MAC for 3DES and CMAC for AES are part of every APDU
  command/response when secure messaging is active after a successful PACE
  or Chip Authentication has been accomplished. Re-authentication after reset of
  the SM protocol is assured by accepting only valid (mandatory) MAC or CMAC
  cryptograms.

7.1.6 SF.LCM Security and life cycle management

SF.LCM.1
  Management of phases and roles
  For the TOE the following life-cycle phases have been identified:
      1. Manufacturing phase
      2. Personalisation phase
      3. Operational phase
      4. Termination phase
  Each life-cycle phase (or state) has its typical user acting as role holder.

                           Polymorphic eMRTD document holder
Terminated phase           None

  All role holders in Manufacturing, Pre-Personalisation and Personalisation
  phases are identified by cryptographic authentication keys. In Operational
  phase the PACE password is required to authenticate the Basic or Extended
  Inspection System in order to get access to the non-sensitive ICAO LDS
  datagroups.
  The IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic
  eMRTD Configuration) Applet maintains the internal life-cycle state the
  moment that the applet is installed. This state, together with the access
  control mechanisms force the Terminal into a specific role, for the pre-
  personalisation and subsequent, personalisation and operational phases. The
  phases (and corresponding life-cycle states) are controlled by APDU
  commands.



SF.LCM.2
  Life Cycle states of the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
  (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet
  The TOE supports the following life-cycle states:
      1. Not instantiated (applet resides in ROM or in EEPROM)
      2. PRE-PERSONALISATION state
      3. PERSONALISATION state
      4. OPERATIONAL state
      5. TERMINATED state (irreversibly)
  Each life-cycle phase (or state) has its typical user acting as role holder.

  It assumed that:
      o All authentication infrastructure keys used by the central Key
          Management       Authority     for   the    polymorphic    authentication
          infrastructure (generation and transformation of PP, PI and CPI) are
          generated, handled and stored securely.
      o The PP/PI/CPI are generated securely by the central Key Management
          Authority of the polymorphic authentication infrastructure and stored
          securely in the eMRTD polymorphic chip during the personalization
          phase.
      o The TOE communicates only with Trustworthy Authentication
          Service/Terminal during the Polymorphic Authentication.
      o The randomised PP, PI and CPI are securely received by Polymorphic
          Authentication Service/Terminal. The randomised PP, PI and CPI are
          transformed (“re-keyed”) by the central Key Management Authority
          (i.e. ElGamal re-encryption of the randomized PP, PI and/or CPI using
          the public key of Servicez Provider, who has is authorized to read the
          plain value of identifying user attributes included in the PP, PI or CPI).
          Identification by the identifying user attributes contained inside the PP,
          PI and CPI takes place at the Service Provider.
  Application Note:
  This Assumption has been added to this ST for the polymorphic authentication
  infrastructure. This addition does not conflict with the strict conformance to
  PACE PP [PACE-PP] and EACv1 PP [EAC-PP-V2].

A.Auth_PKI_Polymorphic
  PKI for Polymorphic eMRTD It is assumed that:
     o The issuing States or Organisations establish a dedicated CVCA, DVCA
        and IS PKI for the polymorphic eMRTD infrastructure.
     o The Country Verifying Certification Authorities, the Document Verifier
        and Extended Inspection Systems hold authentication key pairs and
        certificates for their public keys encoding the access control rights for
        access to the PP, PI and (optional) CPI polymorphic user data. The
        Country Verifying Certification Authorities of the issuing States or
        Organisations are signing the certificates of the Document Verifier and
        the Document Verifiers are signing the certificates of the Polymorphic

      o The issuing State or Organisation establishs the necessary public key
         infrastructure in order to limit the access to Polymorphic data of
         Polymorphic eMRTD document holders to authorized Organisations. The
         Country Verifying Certification Authority of the issuing State or
         Organisation generates card verifiable Document Verifier Certificates
         for the authorized Document Verifier only.
      o The issuing State or Organisation establishs the necessary public key
         infrastructure in order to (i) generate the Polymorphic eMRTD
         document's Chip Authentication Key Pair, (ii) sign and store the Chip
         Authentication Public Key in the Chip Authentication Public Key data

      o The Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer establishes a public key
         infrastructure for the card verifiable certificates used for Terminal
         Authentication. For this aim, the Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer
         shall run a Country Verifying Certification Authority. The PKI shall fulfill
         the requirements and rules of the corresponding certificate policy. The
         Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer shall make the CVCA certificate
         available to the personalization agent or the manufacturer.
      o The polymorphic eMRTD document Issuer issues the polymorphic
         eMRTD document and approves it using the terminals and
         authentication services complying with all applicable laws and
         regulations.
  Application Note:
  This Assumption is an extension of the Assumption 'A.Auth_PKI' defined in
  [EAC-PP-V2]. For the EAC functionality of the TOE the assumption is necessary
  because it covers the pre-requisite for performing the Terminal Authentication

   o   Polymorphic Inspection Systems examine the polymorphic eMRTD
       document presented by the polymorphic eMRTD document holder to
       verify its authenticity by means of the physical security measures and
       to detect any manipulation of the physical part of the polymorphic
       eMRTD document.
    o Polymorphic Inspection Systems include the Country Signing CA Public
       Key and implement the respective terminal part of the protocols
       required to execute PACE with PIN, Passive Authentication (PA), CAv1,
       TAv1 authentication according to [TR-03110-2] and Polymorphic
       Authentication (PMA). They are assumed to securely store static IS
       private keys and generate secure temporary session keys and nonces.
    o The Document Verifier authorizes Polymorphic Inspection Systems by
       creation of Inspection System Certificates for access to polymorphic
       user data stored the polymorphic eMRTD document. An Polymorphic
       Inspection Systems authenticates itselve to the polymorphic eMRTD
       document's chip for getting access to the polymorphic data with its
       private Terminal Authentication key and corresponding Inspection
       System Certificate.
Application Note:
This Assumption is an extension of the Assumption 'A.Insp_Sys' defined in
[EAC-PP-V2]. For the EAC functionality of the TOE the assumption is necessary
because it covers the pre-requisite for performing the PACE with PIN, CAv1
and TAv1 authentication.

4 Security Objectives

This chapter describes the security objectives for the TOE and the security
objectives for the TOE environment. The security objectives for the TOE
environment are separated into security objectives for the development and
production environment and security objectives for the operational environment.


4.1 Security Objectives for the TOE
This section describes the security objectives for the TOE addressing the aspects
of identified threats to be countered by the TOE and organizational security
policies to be met by the TOE.

  communication via the contactless/contact interface of the TOE without
  knowledge of the correct values of shared passwords (PACE passwords) in
  advance.

OT.Prot_Abuse-Func
  Protection against Abuse of Functionality
  The TOE must prevent that functions of the TOE, which may not be used in
  TOE operational phase, can be abused in order (i) to manipulate or to disclose
  the User Data stored in the TOE, (ii) to manipulate or to disclose the TSF-data
  stored in the TOE, (iii) to manipulate (bypass, deactivate or modify) soft-

OT.Prot_Inf_Leak
  Potection against Information Leakage The TOE must provide protection
  against disclosure of confidential User Data or/and TSF-data stored and/or
  processed by the travel document
      by measurement and analysis of the shape and amplitude of signals or the
        time between events found by measuring signals on the electromagnetic
        field, power consumption, clock, or I/O lines,
      by forcing a malfunction of the TOE and/or
      by a physical manipulation of the TOE.

OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper
  Protection against Physical Tampering
  The TOE must provide protection the confidentiality and integrity of the User
  Data, the TSF Data, and the MRTD’s chip Embedded Software. This includes
  protection against attacks with high attack potential by means of
      measuring through galvanic contacts which is direct physical probing on
        the chips surface except on pads being bonded (using standard tools for
        measuring voltage and current) or
      measuring not using galvanic contacts but other types of physical
        interaction between charges (using tools used in solid-state physics
        research and IC failure analysis)
      manipulation of the hardware and its security features, as well as
      controlled manipulation of memory contents (User Data, TSF Data) with a
        prior
      reverse-engineering to understand the design and its properties and
        functions.

OT.Polymorphic_Data_Confidentiality
  Confidentiality of eMRTD polymorphic data
  The TOE must ensure the confidentiality of the sensitive static polymorphic
  eMRTD PI, PP and CPI user data stored on the TOE during personalisation by
  denying all read access to everybody. Only read access to the randomized
  representation of the polymorphic user data is possible and only granted to
  authorized and authenticated Polymorphic Authentication Terminals/Services.
  The TOE must ensure the confidentiality of the eMRTD polymorphic User Data
  (randomized PI, PP and optional CPI) during their exchange between the TOE
  and the Polymorphic Authentication terminal/Service connected after
  successfully executing the sequence of PACE with PIN, PA, CAv1, TAv1 and
  PMA authentication.
  Application Note:
  This OT is an extension of the OTs ‘OT.Sens_Data_Conf’ and

  with the connected Polymorphic Authentication Terminal/Service. This
  extension does not conflict with the strict conformance to PACE and EACv1
  PPs.

OT.Polymorphic_Data_Integrity
  Integrity of eMRTD polymorphic data
  The TOE must ensure the Integrity of the sensitive polymorphic eMRTD PI, PP
  and CPI data and PIN/PUK data stored on it by protecting these data against
  unauthorised     modification     (physical  manipulation and    unauthorised
  modifying).
  Application Note:
  This OT is an extension of the OT ‘OT.Data_Integrity’ defined in [PACE-PP] to
  ensure the integrity of the polymorphic eMRTD user data. This extension does
  not conflict with the strict conformance to PACE and EACv1 PPs.

OT.Polymorphic_Data_Authenticity
  Authenticity of eMRTD polymorphic data
  The TOE must ensure the authenticity of the polymorphic eMRTD randomized
  PI, PP and optional CPI data during their exchange between the TOE and
  Terminal/Authentication Service connected after successfully executing the
  sequence of PACE with PIN, CAv1, TAv1 and PMA.
  Application Note:
  This OT is an extension of the OT ‘OT.Data_Authenticity’ defined in [PACE-PP]
  to ensure the authenticity of the polymorphic eMRTD PI/PP/CPI data. This
  extension does not conflict with the strict conformance to PACE and EACv1
  PPs.

OT.Polymorphic_Data_Privacy
  Privacy of eMRTD polymorphic user data
  The TOE guarantees the privacy of the PI, PP and optional CPI user data by
  randomising the PI, PP and optional CPI user data during the polymorphic
  authentication (PMA), prior to returning it to the authorised Polymorphic
  Authentication Terminal/Service. This prevents the Authenication Service from
  being able to harvest any user or card unique identifiable data.
  Application Note:
  This OT has been added to this ST to ensure and maintain the privacy of the
  polymorphic     PI, PP and optional CPI user data during the Polymorphic
  Authentication (sequence of PACE with PIN, CAv1, TAv1 and PMA). This
  addition does not conflict with the strict conformance to PACE and EACv1 PPs.

  This OT is an extension of the OT ‘OT.AC_Pers’ defined in [PACE-PP] to ensure
  that the polymorphic eMRTD data PI/PP/CPI and PIN/PUK are written by
  authorized Personalisation Agents only. This extension does not conflict with
  the strict conformance to PACE and EACv1 PPs.

OT.DoS
  PIN and PUK are blocking PACE passwords. Therefore the number of incorrect
  authentication attempts on the PACE PIN and PUK passwords shall be
  controlled by the TOE to prevent a denial of service.

  The TOE shall implement the suspend and resume mechanisms specified in
  [TR-3110-2] for blocking PACE passwords, PIN and (if present) PUK.



4.2 Security Objectives for the Operational Environment


4.2.1 Issuing State or Organisation
The Issuing State or Organization will implement the following security objectives
of the TOE environment.


OE.Legislative_Compliance
  Issuing of the travel document
  The travel document Issuer must issue the travel document and approve it
  using the terminals complying with all applicable laws and regulations.

OE.Auth_Key_Travel_Document
  Travel document Authentication Key
  The issuing State or Organisation has to establish the necessary public key
  infrastructure in order to (i) generate the travel document’s Chip
  Authentication Key Pair, (ii) sign and store the Chip Authentication Public Key

  authenticity of the MRTD’s chip used for genuine MRTD by certification of the
  Active Authentication Public Key by means of the Document Security Object.



OE.Authoriz_Sens_Data
  Authorization for Use of Sensitive Biometric Reference Data
  The issuing State or Organisation has to establish the necessary public key
  infrastructure in order to limit the access to sensitive biometric reference data
  of travel document holders to authorized receiving States or Organisations.
  The Country Verifying Certification Authority of the issuing State or
  Organisation generates card verifiable Document Verifier Certificates for the
  authorized Document Verifier only.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Read_Sensitive_Data, the Organisational Security Policy P.Sensitive_Data
  and the Assumption A.Auth_PKI as it specifies the pre-requisite for the
  Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 as it concerns the need of an PKI for this
  protocol and the responsibilities of its root instance. The Terminal
  Authentication Protocol v.1 is one of the additional features of the TOE
  described only in [EAC-PP-V2] and not in [PACE-PP].

4.2.2 Travel document Issuer and CSCA: travel document PKI
(issuing) branch
The travel document Issuer and the related CSCA will implement the following
security objectives for the TOE environment:


OE.Passive_Auth_Sign
  Authentication of travel document by Signature.
  The travel document Issuer has to establish the necessary public key
  infrastructure as follows: the CSCA acting on behalf and according to the
  policy of the travel document Issuer must
      (i) generate a cryptographically secure CSCA Key Pair,
      (ii) ensure the secrecy of the CSCA Private Key and sign Document Signer
          Certificates in a secure operational environment, and

4.      Performance of Evaluation and Certification
The certification body monitors each individual evaluation to ensure a uniorm procedure, a
uniform interpretation of the criteria and uniform ratings.
The product NXP Secure Smart Card Controller N7021 VA including IC Dedicated
Software has undergone the certification procedure at BSI. This is a re-certification based
on BSI-DSZ-CC-0977-2017. Specific results from the evaluation process BSI-DSZ-CC-
0977-2017 were re-used.
The evaluation of the product NXP Secure Smart Card Controller N7021 VA including IC
Dedicated Software was conducted by TÜV Informationstechnik GmbH. The evaluation
was completed on 18 July 2019. TÜV Informationstechnik GmbH is an evaluation facility
(ITSEF)5 recognised by the certification body of BSI.
For this certification procedure the sponsor and applicant is: NXP Semiconductors
Germany GmbH.
The product was developed by: NXP Semiconductors Germany GmbH.
The certification is concluded with the comparability check and the production of this
Certification Report. This work was completed by the BSI.

5.      Validity of the Certification Result
This Certification Report applies only to the version of the product as indicated. The
confirmed assurance package is valid on the condition that
●   all stipulations regarding generation, configuration and operation, as given in the
    following report, are observed,
●   the product is operated in the environment described, as specified in the following report
    and in the Security Target.
For the meaning of the assurance components and assurance levels please refer to CC
itself. Detailed references are listed in part C of this report.
The Certificate issued confirms the assurance of the product claimed in the Security Target
at the date of certification. As attack methods evolve over time, the resistance of the
certified version of the product against new attack methods needs to be re-assessed.
Therefore, the sponsor should apply for the certified product being monitored within the
assurance continuity program of the BSI Certification Scheme (e.g. by a re-assessment or
re-certification). Specifically, if results of the certification are used in subsequent evaluation
and certification procedures, in a system integration process or if a user's risk
management needs regularly updated results, it is recommended to perform a re-
assessment on a regular e.g. annual basis.
In order to avoid an indefinite usage of the certificate when evolved attack methods would
require a re-assessment of the products resistance to state of the art attack methods, the
maximum validity of the certificate has been limited. The certificate issued on 31 July 2019
is valid until 31 July 2024. Validity can be re-newed by re-certification.
The owner of the certificate is obliged:
     1. when advertising the certificate or the fact of the product's certification, to refer to
        the Certification Report as well as to provide the Certification Report, the Security

        Target and user guidance documentation mentioned herein to any customer of the
        product for the application and usage of the certified product,
     2. to inform the Certification Body at BSI immediately about vulnerabilities of the
        product that have been identified by the developer or any third party after issuance
        of the certificate,
     3. to inform the Certification Body at BSI immediately in the case that security relevant
        changes in the evaluated life cycle, e.g. related to development and production sites
        or processes, occur, or the confidentiality of documentation and information related
        to the Target of Evaluation (TOE) or resulting from the evaluation and certification
        procedure where the certification of the product has assumed this confidentiality
        being maintained, is not given any longer. In particular, prior to the dissemination of
        confidential documentation and information related to the TOE or resulting from the
        evaluation and certification procedure that do not belong to the deliverables
        according to the Certification Report part B, or for those where no dissemination
        rules have been agreed on, to third parties, the Certification Body at BSI has to be
        informed.
In case of changes to the certified version of the product, the validity can be extended to
the new versions and releases, provided the sponsor applies for assurance continuity (i.e.
re-certification or maintenance) of the modified product, in accordance with the procedural
requirements, and the evaluation does not reveal any security deficiencies.

1.     Executive Summary
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is the IC hardware platform “NXP Secure Smart Card
Controller N7021 VA including IC Dedicated Software” and documentation describing
instruction set and usage of the TOE. The TOE does not include a customer-specific
Security IC Embedded Software.
The IC Dedicated Software comprises IC Dedicated Test Software for test purposes and
IC Dedicated Support Software. The IC Dedicated Support Software consists of the Boot
Software, which controls the boot process of the hardware platform. Furthermore, it
provides a Firmware Interface and optionally a Library Interface, simplifying access to the
hardware for the Security IC Embedded Software. A System Mode OS is available
(optional), offering ready-to-use resource and access management for customer
applications that do not want to be exposed to the more low-level features of the TOE. The
Flashloader OS (optional) supports download of code and data to Flash by the Composite
Product Manufacturer before Operational Usage (e.g. during development). The
Symmetric Crypto Library (optional) provides simplified access to frequently used
symmetric cryptography algorithms.
The N7021 VA supports two logical cards (Card A and Card B). Both logical cards are
divided into a User Mode and a System Mode. The logical location of the Security IC
Embedded Software depends on the usage of the IC hardware platform. Card A is
reserved for Security IC Embedded Software developed by NXP. Card B is available for
Security IC Embedded Software developed by the customer. If a customer did not order
any NXP developed Security IC Embedded Software product, then User Mode Card A is
not present.
The Security Target [6] is the basis for this certification. It is based on the certified
Protection Profile Security IC Platform Protection Profile with Augmentation Packages
Version 1.0, 13 January 2014, BSI-CC-PP-0084-2014 [8].
The TOE Security Assurance Requirements (SAR) are based entirely on the assurance
components defined in Part 3 of the Common Criteria (see part C or [1], Part 3 for details).
The TOE meets the assurance requirements of the Evaluation Assurance Level EAL 6
augmented by ASE_TSS.2, ALC_FLR.1.
The TOE Security Functional Requirements (SFR) relevant for the TOE are outlined in the
Security Target [6] and [9], chapter 6. They are selected from Common Criteria Part 2 and
some of them are newly defined. Thus the TOE is CC Part 2 extended.
The TOE Security Functional Requirements are implemented by the following TOE

                                      Table 2: Deliverables of the TOE
The requirements for the delivery of the TOE are described in chapter 31 of the “Product
Data Sheet” [11]. For each delivery form of the hardware platform NXP offers two ways of
delivery of the TOE:
1. The customer collects the product himself at the NXP site.
2. The product is sent to the customer by NXP with special protective measures.
The TOE documentation and related software (items are marked in Table 5) are delivered
in electronic form by the document control centre of NXP.
The hardware version can be identified by a coded nameplate as described in [13]
chapters 2.9.2 and 3.2.



                                                                                                       14 / 32

The TOE further provides the FabKey which can be configured by the customer to hold
128 bytes for batch, wafer or die individual data and can be read out by the configuration
interface (see GetFabKey API in [17], chapter 5 and [23], chapter 5.2). The process of
FabKey submission is described in [11], chapter 26.
Only the configurations defined in [17], chapter 5.6.3.2, Tab. 5.40 and in [23], chapter
5.8.3.2, Tab. 5.57 are evaluated options.
The ST references the version of the Crypto Library. This version number is also noted in
the [27], chapter 2 thus the TOE components listed in the guidance are traceable to the
reference given in the Security Target [6] and [9]. Furthermore, [27], chapter 2 describes
the integrity and confidentiality check of files associated with the crypto library. It lists SHA-
256 values for each library file for identification purposes. In addition to identifying the
delivered components, the library identifies itself via its “GetVersion” command.

3.       Security Policy
The security policy enforced is defined by the selected set of Security Functional
Requirements and implemented by the TOE. It covers the following issues:
The Security Policy of the TOE is to provide basic security functionalities to be used by the
smart card operating system and the smart card application thus providing an overall
smart card system security. Therefore, the TOE will implement the symmetric
cryptographic block cipher algorithm to ensure the confidentiality of plain text data by
encryption and to support secure authentication protocols and it will provide a True
Random Number Generator (TRNG) and Deterministic Random Number Generator
(DRNG).
As the TOE is a hardware security platform, the security policy of the TOE is also to
provide protection against leakage of information (e.g. to ensure the confidentiality of
cryptographic keys during cryptographic functions performed by the TOE), against physical
probing, against malfunctions, against physical manipulations and against abuse of
functionality. Hence the TOE shall
     •   maintain the integrity and the confidentiality of data stored in the memory of the
         TOE and
     •   maintain the integrity, the correct operation and the confidentiality of security
         functionalities (security mechanisms and associated functions) provided by the
         TOE.
Specific details concerning the above mentioned security policies can be found in chapter
7 of the Security Target [6] and [9].

4.       Assumptions and Clarification of Scope
The Assumptions defined in the Security Target and some aspects of Threats and
Organisational Security Policies are not covered by the TOE itself. These aspects lead to
specific security objectives to be fulfilled by the TOE Environment. The following topics are
of relevance: OE.Process-Sec-IC, OE.Lim_Block_Loader, OE.Loader_Usage, OE.Check-
Init. Details can be found in the Security Target [6] and [9], chapter 4.3.




                                                                                             15 / 32

5.       Architectural Information
The IC hardware is a microcontroller incorporating a central processing unit (CPU),
memories accessible via a Memory Management Unit (MMU), cryptographic
coprocessors, other security components and several electrical communication interfaces.
The central processing unit supports a 32-/16-bit instruction set optimized for smart card
applications. The first and in some cases the second byte of an instruction are used for
operation encoding. On-chip memories are ROM, RAM and Flash. The Flash can be used
as data or program memory. It consists of highly reliable memory cells, which are designed
to provide data integrity. Flash is optimized for applications that require reliable non-volatile
data storage for data and program code. Dedicated security functionality protects the
contents of all memories.
The IC Dedicated Software comprises IC Dedicated Test Software for test purposes and
IC Dedicated Support Software. The IC Dedicated Support Software consists of the Boot
Software, which controls the boot process of the hardware platform. Furthermore, it
provides a Firmware Interface and optionally a Library Interface, simplifying access to the
hardware for the Security IC Embedded Software. A System Mode OS is available
(optional), offering ready-to-use resource and access management for customer
applications that do not want to be exposed to the more low-level features of the TOE. The
Flashloader OS (optional) supports download of code and data to Flash by the Composite
Product Manufacturer before Operational Usage (e.g. during development). The
Symmetric Crypto Library (optional) provides simplified access to frequently used
symmetric cryptography algorithms.

6.       Documentation
The evaluated documentation as outlined in table 2 is being provided with the product to
the customer. This documentation contains the required information for secure usage of
the TOE in accordance with the Security Target.
Additional obligations and notes for secure usage of the TOE as outlined in chapter 10 of
this report have to be followed.

7.       IT Product Testing
The developer’s testing effort can be summarised in the following aspects.
TOE test configuration and Developer’s testing approach:
     •   All TSF and related security mechanisms, subsystems and modules are tested in
         order to assure complete coverage of all SFR.
     •   Different classes of tests are performed to test the TOE in a sufficient manner
         •   Functional Module verification: For the functional verification, black-box testing
             and white-box testing is performed to ensure the correct functionality as
             specified in the functional specification and customer specifications (ordering
             options).
         •   Security Verification: This test category addresses the security mechanisms
             described in the Security Architecture description. Two main categories of
             security module verification are defined, i.e., integrity protection module




                                                                                           16 / 32

           verification (fault injection) and DPA module verification (side-channel analysis).
           This also includes black-box and white-box testing.
       •   Characterization: This mostly addresses production tests to measure varying
           parameters in post-silicon verification while all parameters are within the
           specified limits. The developer performs a Matrix Characterization Run to
           measure parameters using varying processes (corner material) and different
           temperatures.
       •   Qualification: This test category ensures that a developed IC is production ready
           and has the expected quality. This addresses
           •   electrostatic discharge due to electrostatic stress in the field (contactless
               communication),
           •   fast aging of the device due to high temperatures to guarantee the life time of
               the product
           •   Flash qualification to ensure that features like anti-tearing and wear levelling
               work as specified,
           •   Package qualification to ensure that the IC can be placed in the final delivery
               form (package) under industrial environments and the final product quality is
               achieved, and
           •   PUF qualification to ensure that the promised PUF properties hold in field
               conditions.
       •   Validation: Execution of all customer-visible use cases to ensure that the entire
           system works as defined for customer-visible operation. This includes
           •   on-chip test framework developed to use each officially released product
               variant and execute each public available API,
           •   a Java Card OS is used to execute reference transactions for banking and
               egov.
Independent Testing according to ATE_IND
Testing approach:
   •   The evaluator's objective regarding this aspect was to test the functionality of the
       TOE as described in the ST and to verify the developer's test results by repeating
       developer's tests and additionally add independent tests.
   •   In the course of the evaluation of the TOE the following classes of tests were
       carried out:
       •   Module tests,
       •   Simulation tests,
       •   Tests in User Mode of logical card A and B,
       •   Tests in System Mode of card A and B,
       •   Tests in test mode
       •   Hardware tests and
       •   Cryptographic library tests.


                                                                                           17 / 32

     •   With this kind of tests the entire security functionality of the TOE was tested.
Penetration Testing according to AVA_VAN
Overview:
     •   The penetration testing was partially performed using the developer’s testing
         environment, partially using the test environment of the evaluation body.
     •   All configurations of the TOE being intended to be covered by the current evaluation
         were tested.
     •   The overall test result is that no deviations were found between the expected and
         the actual test results; moreover, no attack scenario with the attack potential high
         was actually successful.
Penetration testing approach:
     •   Systematic search for potential vulnerabilities and known attacks in public domain
         sources, use of a list of vulnerabilities, and from a methodical analysis of the
         evaluation documents.
     •   Analysis why these vulnerabilities are unexploitable in the intended environment of
         the TOE.
     •   If the rationale is suspect in the opinion of the evaluator penetration tests are
         devised.
     •   Even if the rational is convincing in the opinion of the evaluator penetration tests are
         devised for some vulnerabilities, especially to support the argument of non-
         practicability of exploiting time in case of SPA, DPA and FI attacks.

8.       Evaluated Configuration
The N7021 VA can be delivered with various configuration options as described in chapter
1.4.2 of [6] and [9]. The configuration options are divided into two groups: major
configuration options and minor configuration options.
Three major configurations can be chosen by the customer during the ordering process:
     •   Configuration based on 320 kBytes of Flash memory as code space,
     •   Configuration based on 240 kBytes of Flash memory as code space,
     •   Configuration based on 144 kBytes of ROM memory as code space.
Each major configuration is provided with several minor configuration options. These minor
configuration options (and all others) for NXP Secure Smart Card Controller N7021 VA can
be selected by the customer via Order Entry Form (see [28]). The Order Entry Form
identifies all the minor configuration options, which are supported by the major
configuration.
The N7021 VA hardware platform was tested including all minor configuration options that
can be selected based on Table 1.2 in chapter 1.4.2.2 of [6] and [9]. All minor
configurations were available to the evaluator. The major configuration does not have
dependencies to security features. All minor configuration options that are part of the
evaluation were tested. The minor configuration options behave as specified and
described in [11] and [20]. Therefore the results described in this document are applicable
for all minor configurations described in [6] and [9].

The TOE does not include a customer-specific Security IC Embedded Software.

9.        Results of the Evaluation
9.1.       CC specific results
The Evaluation Technical Report (ETR) [7] was provided by the ITSEF according to the
Common Criteria [1], the Methodology [2], the requirements of the Scheme [3] and all
interpretations and guidelines of the Scheme (AIS) [4] as relevant for the TOE.
The Evaluation Methodology CEM [2] was used for those components up to EAL 5
extended by advice of the Certification Body for components beyond EAL 5 and guidance
specific for the technology of the product [4] (AIS 34).
The following guidance specific for the technology was used:
(i)        The Application of CC to Integrated Circuits
(ii)       Application of Attack Potential to Smartcards
(iii)      Guidance, Smartcard Evaluation
(see [4], AIS 25, AIS 37).
For RNG assessment the scheme interpretations AIS 31 was used (see [4]).
To support composite evaluations according to AIS 36 the document ETR for composite
evaluation [10] was provided and approved. This document provides details of this
platform evaluation that have to be considered in the course of a composite evaluation on
top.
As a result of the evaluation the verdict PASS is confirmed for the followin g assurance
components:

A.      Certification

1.      Preliminary Remarks
Under the BSIG1 Act, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) has the task of
issuing certificates for information technology products.
Certification of a product is carried out on the instigation of the vendor or a distributor,
hereinafter called the sponsor.
A part of the procedure is the technical examination (evaluation) of the product according
to the security criteria published by the BSI or generally recognised security criteria.
The evaluation is normally carried out by an evaluation facility recognised by the BSI or by
BSI itself.
The result of the certification procedure is the present Certification Report. This report
contains among others the certificate (summarised assessment) and the detailed
Certification Results.
The Certification Results contain the technical description of the security functionality of
the certified product, the details of the evaluation (strength and weaknesses) and
instructions for the user.

2.      Specifications of the Certification Procedure

3.      Recognition Agreements
In order to avoid multiple certification of the same product in different countries a mutual
recognition of IT security certificates - as far as such certificates are based on ITSEC or
CC - under certain conditions was agreed.

3.1.    European Recognition of CC – Certificates (SOGIS-MRA)
The SOGIS-Mutual Recognition Agreement (SOGIS-MRA) Version 3 became effective in
April 2010. It defines the recognition of certificates for IT-Products at a basic recognition
level and, in addition, at higher recognition levels for IT-Products related to certain SOGIS
Technical Domains only.
The basic recognition level includes Common Criteria (CC) Evaluation Assurance Levels
EAL 1 to EAL 4. For "Smartcards and similar devices" a SOGIS Technical Domain is in
place. For "HW Devices with Security Boxes" a SOGIS Technical Domains is in place, too.
In addition, certificates issued for Protection Profiles based on Common Criteria are part of
the recognition agreement.
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes, details on
recognition, and the history of the agreement can be seen on the website at
https://www.sogisportal.eu.
The SOGIS-MRA logo printed on the certificate indicates that it is recognised under the
terms of this agreement by the related bodies of the signatory nations. A disclaimer
beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of recognition.
This certificate is recognized under SOGIS-MRA for all assurance components selected.

3.2.    International Recognition of CC – Certificates (CCRA)
The international arrangement on the mutual recognition of certificates based on the CC
(Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement, CCRA-2014) has been ratified on 08
September 2014. It covers CC certificates based on collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP)
(exact use), CC certificates based on assurance components up to and including EAL 2 or
the assurance family Flaw Remediation (ALC_FLR) and CC certificates for Protection
Profiles and for collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP).
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes can be seen on
the website: https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org.
The Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement logo printed on the certificate indicates
that this certification is recognised under the terms of this agreement by the related bodies
of the signatory nations. A disclaimer beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of
recognition.
This certificate is recognized according to the rules of CCRA-2014, i. e. up to and including
CC part 3 EAL 2+ ALC_FLR components.

  The digital signature in the Document Security Object relates to all hash
  values for each data group in use according to [ICAO-9303].The
  Personalisation Agent has to ensure that the Document Security Object
  contains only the hash values of genuine user data according to [ICAO-9303].
  The CSCA must issue its certificates exclusively to the rightful organisations
  (DS) and DSs must sign exclusively correct Document Security Objects to be
  stored on travel document.

OE.Personalisation
  Personalisation of travel document
  The travel document Issuer must ensure that the Personalisation Agents
  acting on his behalf
      (i) establish the correct identity of the travel document holder and create
          the biographical data for the travel document,
      (ii) enroll the biometric reference data of the travel document holder,
      (iii) write a subset of these data on the physical Passport (optical
          personalisation) and store them in the travel document (electronic
          personalisation) for the travel document holder as defined in [ICAO-
          9303],
      (iv) write the document details data,
      (v) write the initial TSF data,

4.2.3 Terminal operator: Terminal receiving branch

OE.Terminal
  Terminal operating
  The terminal operators must operate their terminals as follows:
     1.) The related terminals (basic inspection systems, cf. above) are used by
        terminal operators and by travel document holders as defined in [ICAO-
        9303].
     2.) The related terminals implement the terminal parts of the PACE
        protocol [ICAO-9303] part 11, of the Passive Authentication [ICAO-
        9303] part 11 (by verification of the signature of the Document Security

         and (almost) uniformly selected nonces, if required by the protocols (for
         generating ephemeral keys for Diffie-Hellmann).
      3.) The related terminals need not to use any own credentials.
      4.) The related terminals securely store the Country Signing Public Key
         and the Document Signer Public Key (in form of CCSCA and CDS) in
         order to enable and to perform Passive Authentication of the travel
         document (determination of the authenticity of data groups stored in
         the travel document, [ICAO-9303] part 12).
      5.) The related terminals and their environment must ensure
         confidentiality and integrity of respective data handled by them (e.g.
         confidentiality of the PACE passwords, integrity of PKI certificates, etc.),
         where it is necessary for a secure operation of the TOE according to the
         current PP.

4.2.4 Travel document holder Obligations

OE.Travel_Document_Holder
  Travel document holder Obligations
  The travel document holder may reveal, if necessary, his or her verification
  values of the PACE password to an authorized person or device who definitely
  act according to respective regulations and are trustworthy.

4.2.5 Receiving State or Organisation

OE.Exam_Travel_Document
  Examination of the physical part of the travel document
  The inspection system of the receiving State or Organisation must examine
  the travel document presented by the traveler to verify its authenticity by
  means of the physical security measures and to detect any manipulation of the
  physical part of the travel document. The Basic Inspection System for global
  interoperability (i) includes the Country Signing CA Public Key and the

OE.AA_MRTD
      Active Authentication - Inspection Systems5
      An Active Authentication (Basic, General or Extended) Inspection system
      performs all the functions of the Basic, General and Extended Inspection
      System, and verifies the IC authenticity with an RSA or ECDSA signature
      generated by the MRTD (if available).



OE.Prot_Logical_Travel_Document
  Protection of data from the logical travel document
  The inspection system of the receiving State or Organisation ensures the
  confidentiality and integrity of the data read from the logical travel document.
  The inspection system will prevent eavesdropping to their communication with
  the TOE before secure messaging is successfully established based on the Chip
  Authentication Protocol Version 1.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP]in order to handle the Assumption
  A.Insp_Sys by requiring the Inspection System to perform secure messaging
  based on the Chip Authentication Protocol v.1.

OE.Ext_Insp_Systems
  Authorization of Extended Inspection Systems
  The Document Verifier of receiving States or Organisations authorizes
  Extended Inspection Systems by creation of Inspection System Certificates for
  access to sensitive biometric reference data of the logical travel document.
  The Extended Inspection System authenticates themselves to the travel
  document’s chip for access to the sensitive biometric reference data with its
  private Terminal Authentication Key and its Inspection System Certificate.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat

     o All authentication infrastructure keys used by the central Key
        Management       Authority    for   the    polymorphic   authentication
        infrastructure (generation and transformation of PP, PI and CPI) are
        generated, handled and stored securely.
     o The Issuer has to ensure that Polymorphic PP/PI/CPI user data is
        generated securely by the central Key Management Authority of the
        polymorphic authentication infrastructure and stored securely in the
        electronic document during the eMRTD personalization phase.
     o The TOE communicates only with a Trustworthy Authentication
        Service/Terminal during the Polymorphic eMRTD authentication process
        steps (i.e. during sequence of PACE with PIN, PA, CAv1, TAv1 and
        PMA).
     o The authorized Polymorphic Authentication Service/Terminal has to
        ensure that the randomised PP, PI and optional CPI are securely
        received and transformed by the central Key Management Authority.
        This comprises:
         eMRTD       document      authentication   by   performing   Passive
            Authentication (SOD and DG14) signature verification and Chip
            Authentication (CAv1), being part of the Polymorphic Authentication
            process steps (i.e. sequence of PACE with PIN, PA, CAv1, TAv1 and
            PMA).
         eMRTD document status validation by encryption of the randomized
            PP received from the TOE using the public key of the eMRTD
            document Status Service and sending this with the the
            coresponding meta-data obtained from the TOE to the eMRTD
            document Status Service.

4.3 Security Objectives Rationale

4.3.1 Threats

4.3.1.1 Threats listed in PP PACE

T.Skimming addresses accessing the User Data (stored on the TOE or
  transferred between the TOE and the terminal) using the TOE's
  contactless/contact interface. This threat is countered by the security
  objectives        OT.Data_Integrity,        OT.Data_Authenticity        and
  OT.Data_Confidentiality through the PACE authentication. The objective
  OE.Travel_Document_Holder ensures that a PACE session can only be
  established either by the travel document holder itself or by an authorised
  person or device, and, hence, cannot be captured by an attacker.

T.Eavesdropping addresses listening to the communicatiECOVERY
                      •   OT.SCP.SUPPORT instead of OE.SCP.SUPPORT
                      •   OT.SCP.IC instead of OE.SCP.IC
                      •   OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT instead of OE.CARD-MANAGEMENT
                      OT.SCP.RECOVERY, OT.SCP.SUPPORT, and OT.SCP.IC are objectives for the
                      TOE as the Smart Card Platform belongs to the TOE for this evaluation. OT.CARD-
                      MANAGEMENT is an objective for the TOE as the Card Manager belongs to the TOE
                      for this evaluation. Moving objectives from the environment to the TOE adds objectives
                      to the TOE without changing the overall objectives. The statement of security objectives
                      is therefore equivalent to the security objectives in the PP [6] to which conformance is
                      claimed.

FIA_API.1.1                 The reased by
means of configuration options.
The key lengths used for the AES and DES functionality follow the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100
bit security level issued by the BSI1. This regulation excludes the single DES operation from the certification as it
is considered to be not sufficiently secure from algorithm perspective.
For both versions, the certification covers the SCL cryptographic functionality of the AES algorithm with key
lengths of 128, 192, 256 bits and the TDEA or TripleDES (TDES) algorithm with an effective key size of 112 and
168 Bits. For the version v2.04.002 the certification covers the CMAC functionality too.

Beside the inclusion and support of cryptographic libraries this TOE comes with the optional Hardware Support
Library (HSL) in different alternative versions significantly simplifying the management of the SOLID FLASH™
NVM functionality. The HSL (all versions) constitutes an application interface (API) accessing the HSL state
machine and abstracting low level properties like special function registers and settings of specific hardware

features. In short the HSL provides a user friendly also use case oriented interface considering endurance,
reliability and performance.
All HSL library versions are delivered as object code.
The HSL is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software.
All HSL versions implement, beyond the low level driver, the basic method In-place Update leveraging the
dedicated advantages of the new SOLID FLASH™ NVM technology.
In addition to the above, all HSL versions provide an advanced additional method called Incremental Write (IWR).
This method provides enhanced endurance of the SOLID FLASH NVM even beyond the erase endurance limits
for often written objects. Thus this method serves applications with a demand for high endurance and fast
writing times. On the other hand, the read times using this method are slower than the other methods provided.
The HSL versions provide tearing save behavior, whereas we define tearing as an untimed power cut off which
could occur anytime and in the worse therewith could also occur during writing to or erasing of pages in the
SOLID FLASH™ NVM.
If the HSL – all versions are meant - comes with the TOE and the user implements the offered configuration and
dedicated functions tearing save behaviour of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM is provided. In these cases the user does
not need to care about tearing events since either the old data or the new data are correctly in place.
In addition to the versions 01.22.4346 and 02.01.6634, the HSLs in versions 03.11.8339 and 03.12.8812 provide a
furthermore improved method for the Incremental Write (IWR).
But, even in the cases where the user decides not to use the HSL and did also not implement own routines
preserving the consistency of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM, the hardware protection means prevent from operation
of inconsistent data. Therefore, in no cases a tearing event leads to an exploitable situation respectively
vulnerability.
Anyhow, the user should be aware and is recommended to use either the HSL or implement own routines
managing tearing events since if there would occur a faulty programmed SOLID FLASH™ NVM location the TOE
ends operation at that point.

The order option CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CIPURSE™ CL) provides cryptographic functionality to
implement a CIPURSE™ V2 conformant protocol.
This protocol provides a secure mutual authentication of two entities, namely the terminal (denoted as PCD =
Proximity Coupling Device (CIPURSE™-compliant terminal)) and a smart card or a token in other form factors
which is called PICC. PICC stands for Proximity Integrated Circuit Card (CIPURSE™-compliant card).
Beside the mutual authentication, the protocol implements measures to maintain the integrity of the after
passing successfully the authentication transferred data. It depends on the chosen operation mode whether the
user requires integrity protection only, for example if the exchange is used in a secure environment only, or
whether complete protection including the encrypted transfer of user data between the two authentication
entities is an issue. Both operation modes are part of the CIPURSE™ open standard and offered as integrity
protection mode and as confidential communication mode.
By that the CIPURSE™ CL supports the user to implement systems conformant to the CIPURSE™ open standard
implementing a secured, interoperable and flexible transit fare collection solution, including ISO 7816, ISO/IEC
14443-4 communication and AES-128 bit cryptography for multiple payment types.
The CIPURSE™ CL is conformant to the CIPURSE™ open standard [18] for both, the PICC and then PCD software
parts. It implements the by the OSPT alliance standardized application interface for the card and the terminal
side.
The scope of this certification of this TOE covers all parts of the CIPURSE™ CL which are later implemented by
the user on the user card respectively token based on this TOE and the functionality of the PCD software part
which is implemented in the terminal side. The PCD software operates also on the hardware of this TOE which is
implemented in the terminal.
The CIPURSE™ CL implements the by the OSPT alliance standardized application interface for the card and the
terminal side.
The certification comprises the entire functionality of the optional CIPURSE™ CL implemented and operated on
the TOE hardware. On one hand the TOE can operate the PICC side software part as a token and on the other
hand, a second TOE product operates the PCD side software part if used inside a terminal or similar system.

Target of Evaluation Description


The environment on the terminal, the terminal systems, their security and their interfaces to the background
systems are not in the scope of this certification. The user operating system and further applications
implemented on the TOE are also out of scope of this certification.
To summarize, if used with the PCD software the certification view equals to the case where the TOE is running
the PICC software: The TOE operates one of the optional software parts of the CIPURSE™ CL – regardless
whether PICC or PCD part - and is enabled to communicate via the selected interfaces. The surrounding
environment is in both cases out of scope. The CIPURSE™ CL is delivered as object code and in this way
integrated in the user software.

The NRG software is a further order option, which implements the routines for a NRG interface. The NRG
implements an operating system handling the emulation of an NRG card together with the RF interface. One
part of the NRG software is permanently stored in the ROM and the second part consisting of patch and API is
located in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The second part is only present if the NRG is a part of the delivery. If the
NRG is not part of the delivery the ROM part is present but not used. The NRG implements tearing safe
behaviour in context with the SOLID FLASH™ NVM management and is therefore independent from the HSL.
The NRG NVM part is – if ordered – delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software.
The NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

Note 1:
The asymmetric cryptographic libraries regardless of the version chosen are delivery options.
Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations with the other libraries of or without these libraries. In the
case of coming without one or any combination of the asymmetric libraries the TOE does not provide the
Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or Elliptic Curve
Cryptography (EC).

The symmetric cryptographic library SCL, in two alternative versions, is a delivery option.
Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations with the other libraries of or without these libraries. In the
case of coming without the SCL the TOE does not provide the specific security functionality implemented by this
software. Even in case of a TOE coming without SCL, the symmetric cryptographic functionality is unchanged
covered by the hardware symmetric cryptographic coprocessor SCP.

The presence of the cryptographic library CIPURSE™ CL is a delivery option.
Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations with the other libraries of or without these libraries. In the
case of coming without the CIPURSE™ CL, the TO  Administration Manual (cf. DocStore

Identification of the platform is performed by the procedure according to [AGD_PRE].
Once the platform is identified correctly, the correct version of the Java card layer of the TOE (NXP eDoc
Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 - cryptovision ePasslet Suite, version 3.5) can be verified as descibed in [Guidance].

1.4.4 TOE functions
The TOE comprises all IT security functionality necessary to ensure the secrecy of the SCD and the security
of the digital signature. The TOE provides the following functions:

       to import signature creation data (SCD) and, optionally, the correspondent signature verification
        data (SVD),
       to, optionally, receive and store certificate info,
       to switch the TOE from a non-operational state to an operational state, and
       if in an operational state, to create electronic signatures for data with the following steps:
        a) select an SCD if multiple are present in the SSCD,
        b) authenticate the signatory and determine its intent to sign,
        c) receive data to be signed or a unique representation thereof (DTBS/R)
        d) apply an appropriate cryptographic signature-creation function using the selected SCD to the
           DTBS/R.
The TOE may implement its function for digital signature creation to conform to the specifications in ETSI
TS 101 733 (CAdES) [CADES], ETSI TS 101 903 (XAdES) [XADES] and ETSI TS 101 903 (PADES) [PADES].
The TOE is prepared for the signatory's use by
       import at least one set of SCD, and
       personalising for the signatory by storing in the TOE:
        a) the signatory’s reference authentication data (RAD)
        b) optionally, certificate info for at least one SCD in the TOE.
After preparation the SCD shall be in a non-operational state. Upon receiving a TOE the signatory shall verify
its non-operational state and change the SCD state to operational.

After import the SCD is in a non-operational state. Upon receiving a TOE the signatory shall verify its non-
operational state and change the SCD state to operational.

After preparation the intended legitimate user should be informed of the signatory’s verification authenti-
cation data (VAD) required for use of the TOE in signing. If the VAD is a password or PIN, the means of
providing this information is expected to protect the confidentiality and the integrity of the corresponding
RAD.

If the use of an SCD is no longer required, then it should be destroyed (e.g. by erasing it from memory) as
well as the associated certificate info, if any exists.

1.4.5 Operation of the TOE
This paragraph presents a functional overview of the TOE in its distinct operational environments:


                                                     8 of 82
NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 / SSCD with Key Import Security Target Lite


       The preparation environment, where the TOE interacts with a certification service provider (CSP)
        through a SCD/SVD generation application to import the signature creation data (SCD) and a certif-
        icate generation application (CGA) to obtain a certificate for the signature validation data (SVD)
        corresponding to the SCD the certification service provider has generated. The SCD/SVD generation
        application transmits the SVD to the CGA. The initialisation environment interacts further with the
        TOE to personalise it with the initial value of the reference authentication data (RAD).
       The signing environment where the TOE interacts with a signer through a signature creation appli-
        cation (SCA) to sign data after authenticating the signer as its signatory. The signature creation ap-
        plication provides the data to be signed (DTBS), or a unique representation thereof (DTBS/R) as
        input to the TOE signature creation function and obtains the resulting digital signature2.
       The management environments where the TOE interacts with the user or an SSCD-provisioning ser-
        vice provider to perform management operations, e.g. for the signatory to reset a blocked RAD. A
        single device, e.g. a smart card terminal, may provide the required secure environment for man-
        agement and signing.
The preparation environment, the signing environment and the management environment are secure and
protect data exchanged with the TOE. Figure 3 in prEN 14169-1:2011 illustrates the operational environ-
ment.
The TOE stores signature creation data (SCD) and reference authentication data (RAD). The TOE may store
multiple instances of SCD. In this case the TOE provides a function to identify each SCD and the SCA can
provide an interface to the signer to select an SCD for use in the signature creation function of the SSCD.
The TOE protects the confidentiality and integrity of the SCD and restricts its use in signature creation to its
signatory. The digital signature created by the TOE may be used to create an advanced electronic signature
as defined in Article 5.1 of the [Directive]3. Determining the state of the certificate as qualified is beyond
the scope of this standard.
The signature creation application is assumed to protect the integrity of the input it provides to the TOE
signature creation function as being consistent with the user data authorised for signing by the signatory.
Unless implicitly known to the TOE, the SCA indicates the kind of the signing input (as DTBS/R) it provides
and computes any hash value required. The TOE may augment the DTBS/R with signature parameters it
stores and then computes a hash value over the input as needed by the kind of input and the used crypto-
graphic algorithm.
The TOE stores signatory reference authentication data (RAD) to authenticate a user as its signatory. The
RAD is a password (e.g. PIN), a biometric template or a combination of these. The TOE protects the confi-
dentiality and integrity of the RAD. The TOE may provide a user interface to directly receive verification
authentication data (VAD) from the user, alternatively, the TOE receive the VAD from the signature creation
application (SCA). If the signature creation application handles, is requesting or obtaining a VAD from the
user, it is assumed to protect the confidentiality and integrity of this data.
A certification service provider and a SSCD-provisioning service provider interact with the TOE in the secure
preparation environment to perform any preparation function of the TOE required before control of the
TOE is given to the legitimate user. These functions may include:
       initialising the RAD,
       generating a key pair,

2 At a pure functional level the SSCD creates a digital signature; for an implementation of the SSCD, in that
meeting the requirements of this PP and with the key certificate created as specified in the Directive, Annex
I, the result of the signing process can be used as to create a qualified electronic signature.
3Please note that while this security target - following the according protection profile BSI-CC-PP-0075-
2012-MA-01 - references the [Directive], it also incorporates the requirements of the eIDAS regulation [Re-
gulation] and the according commission implementing regulation [Implementing].

         storing personal information of the legitimate user.
In the case at hand the TOE is a smart card or electronic ID document. In this case a smart-card terminal
may be deployed that provides the required secure environment to handle a request for signatory authori-
zation. A signature can be obtained on a document prepared by a signature-creation application component
running on personal computer connected to the card terminal. The signature creation application, after
presenting the document to the user and after obtaining the authorization PIN initiates the electronic sig-
nature creation function of the smart card through the terminal.
The RAD verification is typically performed by direct PIN verification (VERIFY PIN command); to further pro-
tect the RAD (password or PIN) – especially in a contactless application scenario – the Password Authenti-
cated Connection Establishmanet (PACE) protocol according to [TR03110] can be used.

1.4.6 Major security features of the TOE
The TOE provides the following TOE security functionalities:
         TSF_Access manages the access to objects (files, directories, data and secrets) stored in the applet’s
          file system. It also controls write access of initialization, pre-personalization and personalization
          data4.
         TSF_Admin manages the storage of manufacturing data, pre-personalization data and personaliza-
          tion data.
         TSF_Secret ensures secure management of secrets such as cryptographic keys. This covers secure
          key storage, access to keys as well as secure key deletion. These mechanisms are mainly provided
          by TSF_OS.
         TSF_Crypto performs high level cryptographic operations. The implementation is mainly based on
          the Security Functionalities provided by TSF_OS.
         TSF_SecureMessaging realizes a secure communication channel.
         TSF_Auth realizes two authentication mechanisms: PIN verification and alternatively authentication
          with the PACE protocol.
         TSF_Integrity protects the integrity of internal applet data like the Access control lists.
         TSF_OS contains all security functionalities provided by the certified platform (IC, Javacard opera-
          tion system). The cryptographic operations needed for this TOE are provided by the platform:
              o   Electronic signature-generation with RSA and key sizes of 2000 up to 4096 bit in steps of 1
                  bit, or ECDSA with key sizes of key sizes of 160 bit to 521 bit in steps of one bit.
              o   Secure messaging with AES (128, 192 or 256 bit key length).
              o   PACE authentication with key lengths of 160 bit to 521 bit in steps of one bit (ECC).

1.4.7 TOE life cycle
This paragraph is based on the protection profile [PP0075].

1.4.7.1    General



4 In the context of this security target the three categories are defined as follows: initialization comprises
the preparation of the TOE based on proprietary operations of the platform with the Java Card operation
system; pre-personalization comprises the configuration of the card manager and security domains as well
as the generation of applet instances using Global Platform commands. Personalization is carried out after-
wards using commands of the applet layer of the TOE.

Figure 3: Example of TOE lifecycle following figure 1 of [PP0075]. Note that import of certificate info during
TOE preparation and deletion of certificate info when SCD is destroyed are optional. The delivery to the
SSCD provisioning service after the development phase is also the end of the scope of the certification ac-
cording to Common Criteria.

The operational usage of the TOE comprises the preparation stage and the operational use stage. The TOE
operational use stage begins when the signatory has obtained both the VAD and the TOE. Enabling the TOE
for signing requires at least one set of SCD stored in its memory.
Figure 3 shows an example of the lifecycle where an SCD or SCD/SVD pair is imported from SSCD-
provisioning service before delivery to the signatory. The lifecycle may allow import of SCD or SCD/SVD key
pairs after delivery to the signatory as well.
The TOE life cycle ends when all keys stored in it have been rendered permanently unusable. Rendering a
key in the SSCD unusable may include deletion of any stored corresponding certificate info. The lifecycle
may allow generation of SCD or SCD/SVD key pairs after delivery to the signatory as well.

1.4.7.2   Preparation stage
The preparation phase of the TOE lifecycle is processing the TOE from the customer's acceptance of the
delivered TOE to a state ready for operation by the signatory. The customer receiving the TOE from the


                                                    12 of 82
NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 / SSCD with Key Import Security Target Lite


manufacturer is the SSCD-provisioning service that prepares and provides the SSCD to subscribers. The
preparation includes
         Create and configure the signature application according to AGD_PRE; this step involves applet
          instanciation as well as creation of the file system (card profile).5
         The personalisation of the TOE for use by the signatory, i.e. the installation of the RAD in the TOE
          and handover of VAD to the signatory.
         The initialisation of the TOE, i.e. the CSP generates the SCD/SVD pair by means of a SCD/SVD gen-
          eration device, loads the SCD to the TOE, and sends the SVD to the CGA. The TOE may import and
          store the SCD/SVD pair.
         The generation of the (qualified) certificate containing among others (cf. [1], Annex II)
              a) the SVD which correspond to SCD under the control of the signatory;
              b) the name of the signatory or a pseudonym, which is to be identified as such,
              c) an indication of the beginning and end of the period of validity of the certificate.

         The preparation may include optional loading of the certificate info into the SSCD for signatory con-
          venience.
The CSP generates a SCD/SVD pair and imports SCD, and optionally also SVD, into the SSCD. The CSP ensures
          a) the correspondence between SCD and SVD,
          b) that algorithm and key size for the SVD are appropriate.

Please take note that verifying whether the claimed identity of the signer originates from that given SSCD
has to be done by the CSP operating the CGA.
If the TOE is used for creation of advanced electronic signatures, the certificate links the signature verifica-
tion data to the person (i.e. the signatory) and confirms the identity of that person (cf. [Directive], article 2,
Clause 9).
This security target requires the TOE to provide mechanisms for import of SCD, implementation of the SCD
and personalisation. The environment is assumed to protect all other processes for TOE preparation like
SCD transfer between the SCD/SVD generation device and the TOE, and SVD transfer between the SCD/SVD
generation device and the CGA. The CSP may export the SVD to the TOE for internal use by the TOE (e.g.,
self-test).
Before generating a (qualified) certificate, the CSP is expected to first store the SCD in a SSCD. A secure
channel with the TOE may be used to support this, by ensuring integrity of the SCD during transmission to
the TOE.

1.4.7.3    Operational use stage
In this lifecycle stage the signatory can use the TOE to create advanced electronic signatures.
The operational phase of the TOE starts when at least one SCD/SVD pair is generated by the CSP and the
SCD is imported into the SSCD and when the signatory takes control over the TOE and makes the SCD oper-
ational. The signatory uses the TOE with a trustworthy SCA in a secured environment only. The SCA is as-
sumed to protect the DTBS/R during the transmission to the TOE.




5 This preparation step has been added to the life cycle definition of the underlying Protection Profile and
is necessary to provide the basic functionality (i.e. application and file system) for the following steps. It
may be performed by the SSCD-provisioning service provider directly or by a separate entity (card manu-
facturer).

                                                    13 of 82
NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 / SSCD with Key Import Security Target Lite


The signatory can also interact with the SSCD to perform management tasks, e.g. reset a RAD value or use
counter if the password/PIN in the reference data has been lost or blocked. Such management tasks require
a secure environment.
The signatory can render an SCD in the TOE permanently unusable. Rendering the last SCD in the TOE per-
manently unusable ends the life of the TOE as SSCD.
The TOE may support functions to generate additional signing keys. If the TOE supports these functions it
will support further functions to securely obtain certificates for the new keys. For an additional key the
signatory may be allowed to choose the kind of certificate (qualified, or not) to obtain for the SVD of the
new key. The signatory may also be allowed to choose some of the data in the certificate request for in-
stance to use a pseudonym instead of the legal name in the certificate5. If the conditions to obtain a quali-
fied certificate are met, the new key can also be used to create advanced electronic signatures. The optional
TOE functions for additional key generation and certification may require additional security functions in
the TOE and an interaction with the SSCD-provisioning service provider in an environment that is secure.
The TOE life cycle as SSCD ends when all SCD stored in the TOE are destructed. This may include deletion of
the corresponding certificates.

Public Security Target
Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Target of Evaluation Description


The firmware and software parts of the TOE comprise:

Firmware
     in several alternative versions,
      whereas the latter version provides additional functionality regarding the TOE identification as order
      option
     Boot Software (BOS)
     Resource Management System (RMS)
     Flash Loader (FL)
     RFAPI functions
      The RFAPI is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
     NRG basic functions in ROM.
      The NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

Optional Software
    RSA cryptographic library in three alternative versions
    EC cryptographic library in three alternative versions
    Toolbox library in three alternative versions.
      None of the Toolbox libraries is part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
    SCL library in two alternative versions
    HSL library in four alternative versions
    CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library
    NRG library.
      The NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).


2.2.3          Interfaces of the TOE
       The physical interface of the TOE to the external environment is the entire surface of the IC.
       The electrical interface of the TOE to the external environment is constituted by the pads of the chip,
        particularly ISO pads, the CLK and power supply pads, as well as the pads used for contactless and
        contact based interfacing.
        A further electrical interface are the La and Lb pads used for the antenna connection and alternatively for
        the ACLB communication mode connecting an external reader chip which is not part of the TOE.
       The RF interface (radio frequency power and signal interface) enables contactless communication
        between a PICC (proximity integration chip card, PICC) and a PCD reader/writer (proximity coupling
        device, PCD). Power supply is received and data are received or transmitted by an antenna which
        consists of a coil with a few turns directly connected to the IC. Depending on customer orders the
        contactless interface options are set by means of blocking either at Infineon premises or at the premises
        of the user.
       The data-oriented I/O interface to the TOE is formed by the pads used for contact based or contactless
        communication.
       The interface to the firmware – regardless of the version chosen – is constituted by special registers used
        for hardware configuration and control (Special Function Registers, SFR).
       The interface of the TOE to the operating system is constituted by the RMS and by the instruction set of
        the TOE.
       The interface of the TOE to the test routines is formed by the BOS test routine call, i.e. entry to the test
        modes.

Public Security Target
Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Target of Evaluation Description


       The interface to the RSA calculations is defined from the RSA library interface. This is regardless of the
        version chosen.
       The interface to the EC calculations is defined from the EC library interface. This is regardless of the
        version chosen.
       The interface to the Toolbox is defined by the Toolbox library interface. This is regardless of the version
        chosen.
       The interface to the SCL is defined by the Symmetric Cryptographic Library interface. This is regardless
        of the version chosen.
       The interface to the HSL is defined by the functions of the Hardware Support Library interface. This is
        regardless of the version chosen.
       The interface to the CIPURSE™ CL is defined by the functions of the CIPURSE™ cryptographic library
        (each version). This is regardless of the version chosen.
       The NRG interface is defined by the functions of the NRG Software.

Note that the interfaces to the optional software parts are only present, if the TOE comes with the belonging
software part depending on the customer order.


2.2.4          Guidance documentation
The following provides a brief overview of the document set constituting the user guidance for this TOE. The
exact document titles and versions are given in chapter 9.

                      The set of SFRs that define the card content management mechanism CarG are partly
                      replaced or refined and are considered to be equivalent or more restrictive because of
                      the newly introduced SFPs:
                      1. Security Domain access control policy,
                      2. Secure Channel Protocol information flow policy

    2.4         TOE Overview

2.4.1               TOE Definition
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) addressed by this ST is an electronic passport representing a smart card
implementing [ICAO_9303_10], [ICAO_9303_11], [TR-03110_1] and [TR-03110_3]. This smart card / passport
provides the following application:
     the travel document containing the related user data as well as data needed for authentication with BAC,
     PACE, EAC or AA protocols (incl. PACE/BAC passwords); this application is intended to be used by
     governmental organisations as a machine readable travel document (MRTD).
For the ePassport application, the travel document holder can control access to his user data by conscious
presenting his travel document to governmental organisations.The travel document’s chip is integrated into a
physical (plastic or paper), optically readable part of the travel document, which – as the final product – shall
eventually supersede still existing, merely optically readable travel documents. The plastic or paper, optically
readable cover of the travel document, where the travel document’s chip is embedded in, is not part of the
TOE. The tying-up of the travel document’s chip to the plastic travel document is achieved by physical and
organizational security measures being out of scope of the TOE.

2.4.2               TOE Operational Usage
A State or Organization issues MRTDs to be used by the holder for international travel. The traveler presents a
MRTD to the inspection system to prove his or her identity. The MRTD in context of this ST contains (i) visual
(eye readable) biographical data and portrait of the holder, (ii) a separate data summary (MRZ data) for visual
and machine reading using OCR methods (see [ICAO_9303_01]) in the Machine readable zone (MRZ) and (iii)
data elements on the MRTD’s chip. The authentication of the traveller is based on (i) the possession of a valid
travel document personalised for a holder with the claimed identity as given on the biographical data page and
(ii) biometrics using the reference data stored in the travel document. The issuing State or Organisation ensures
the authenticity of the data of genuine travel documents. The receiving State trusts a genuine travel document
of an issuing State or Organisation.

2.4.3               TOE Major Security Features
The following TOE security features are the most significant for its operational use:
    Verifying authenticity and integrity as well as securing confidentiality of user data in the communication
     channel between the TOE and the connected terminal supporting the protocols BAC, SAC(PACE) as per
     [ICAO_9303_11] and EAC as per [TR-03110_1]
    Averting of inconspicuous tracing of the travel document as per [TR-03110_1]
    Self-protection of the TOE security functionality and the data stored inside as per [TR-03110_1]
    Means to check authenticity of the terminal, Terminal Authentication as per [TR-03110_1]
    Means to prove authenticity of the chip by means of Active Authentication or Chip Authentication as per [TR-
     03110_1]
    Chip authentication followed by terminal authentication used as a precondition to provide access to
     biometric data known as EAC, as per [TR-03110_1]

 2.6              TOE Description

2.6.1               Component Overview
The TOE is a DI chip with the ePassport configuration of SECORA™ ID S Infineon Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0.
It is based on the requirements from the ICAO for machine readable travel documents, i.e. [ICAO_9303_10],
[ICAO_9303_11], [TR-03110_1] and [TR-03110_3].
Figure 1 shows the TOE in terms of its components.
The grey color indicates what contributes to fulfill the security claims in this ST. The white color indicates
optional components which are not in the scope of the security claims of this ST, in CC terminology these are
non interefering with the TSF of the TOE.
   -    The two lower layers in the picture represent the smart card controller referenced by IFX_CCI_000005
        together with the Firmware, Asymmetric Cryptographic Library (ACL) and a Symmetric Crypto Library
        (SCL). Note that these components are certified by the same CC certificate BSI-DSZ-CC-1110-V2-2019.
        The hardware platform provides effective protection mechanisms against fault attacks. The platform
        contains hardware co-processors, which support cryptographic standards such as TDES, AES, RSA and
        EC. The hardware co-processor SCP has integrated measures against successful SCA.
   -    The OS platform called “Secora ID S” is a Java Card OS and offers services for:
                 The standard Java Card features like API, the Java Card Runtime Environment and the Java
                  Card Virtual Machine
               Proprietary PACE API providing special countermeasures against side channel leakage
               GP for content management
               Crypto operations (hash, EC, RSA, TDES and AES)
               Communication via the contactless interface and contact interface.
        It is certified in Common Criteria under the Certificate NSCIB-CC-175887.
        Secora ID S supports the standard open Java Card mode as well as the proprietary static mode
        (installation of preloaded code is possible) and the proprietary mode native (specially tailored mode for
        eMRTD usecase which enforces non traceablity of the TOE). Open and static modes are the two possible

       modes during personalization of the TOE. The TOE goes into native mode once the personalization is
       terminated. See [ST_JC_ID_S_Platform] for more details on the supported modes in Secora ID S OS.
   -   ISO or EU Electronic Driving License (eDL) or an Electronic ID(eID) are configurations of SECORA™ ID S
       Applet Infineon Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0. For more information on these optional features refer
       to [UserGuideDataBook], [UserGuideAdmin]. As already said these applications are not part of the TOE
       Security Functionalities and are non interfering with the TSFs of the TOE. The installation of eDL and
       eID is done by the customer who uses the cap file of SECORA™ ID S Applet Infineon Applet Collection
       preloaded on the card by Infineon. Again, no claims of the security for the eDL or the eID applications
       are made in this ST.
   -   ePassport configuration of SECORA™ ID S Applet Infineon Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0 is a Java Card
       applet which provides the functions of the electronic Passport as per [ICAO_9303_10], [ICAO_9303_11],
       [TR-03110_1] and [TR-03110_3].
       The installation of ePass is done by the customer who uses for this purpose the cap file of SECORA™ ID
       S Applet Infineon Applet Collection preloaded on the card by Infineon.
       The applet uses the services of the Java Card Secora ID S OS described above. It manages the various
       stages of the product’s lifecycle once the application is onto the hardware up to its end of life. The
       application implements the protocols:
                 BAC
                 PACE
                 EAC
                 AA
       It does not implement any cryptographic primitives, as these are provided by the underlying Java Card
       OS. Further it manages file access control and authentication failure handling. Also the application
       controls the secure messaging including error handling using the Java Card OS Crypto services, which
       subsequently relies on the features of the underlying hardware providing high integrity and side
       channel protection. The claims in terms of SFRs in this ST target the SECORA™ ID S Applet Infineon
       Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0.

   -   Third party applications can be installed by the customer and running on the card. Note that in this
       case the JC Secora ID S is delivered in open mode, see [ST_JC_ID_S_Platform] to the customer which
       will be then able to load and install 3rd party applications.
The TOE user guidance comprises:
   -   [UserGuideDataBook] and [UserGuideAdmin] which provide guidance, how to perform personalization
       and maintain the targeted security level during Personalisation and Operation phase.

Figure 1      TOE components overview




2.6.2              Interfaces of the TOE
   -    The physical interface of the TOE to the external environment is the entire surface of the IC.
   -    The RF interface (radio frequency power and signal interface) enabling contactless communication
        between a PICC (proximity integration chip card, PICC) and a terminal reader/writer (proximity coupling
        device, terminal). The transmission protocol meets [ISO/IEC 14443-3] and [ISO/IEC 14443-4] Type B.
   -    The contact based interface ISO 7816-3 supported for the purposes of eID and eDL.
   -    The command interface to the TOE is provided by the ePassport Application.



2.6.3              Package Types
The TOE package types and formats are exactly the same as for the underlying Java Card OS. The package
types and formats of the Java Card OS Secora ID S are described in [ST_JC_ID_S_Platform], section 1.4.3 and
1.4.6.


2.6.4              Lifecycle and Delivery
The [PP_EAC], [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC] define the lifecycle phases for the TOE as follows:
1. Development
   - Step 1: Development of hardware and IC dedicated software (firmware)
   - Step 2: Development of IC embedded software

2. Manufacturing
   - Step 3: manufacturing of IC and IC dedicated software. As the TOE does not provide any user ROM,
       manufacturing of IC embedded software parts in ROM are not relevant here.
   - Step 4 (optional): Combination of IC with contactless interface of the travel document
   - Step 5 (Prepersonalization): loading on the device of the executable Java Card OS image. Loading of
       the application JC package containing the TOE code, eDL and eID code.
3. Personalisation of Travel Document
   - Step 6: this step is performed by the customer. The customer receives from Infineon the TOE
       composed of the following components:
           o The underlying hardware
           o The underlying Java Card OS can be in two possible modes: either in the standard Java Card
                open mode (loading and installation of applets are possible) or in the proprietary Java Card
                static mode (preloaded by Infineon packages can be installed, applet loading is not possible).
           o The cap file of SECORA™ ID S Applet Infineon Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0 is preloaded by
                Infineon.
           o The customer then proceeds to installing the ePassport configuration of SECORA™ ID S Infineon
                Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0 and optionally installing the ISO/EU eDL or eID. In case the
                Secora ID S is in open mode the customer can load and install 3rd party applets. During this step
                the customer also performs the personalisation with biometric data and configuration of the
                TSF if necessary.
4. Operational Use
   - Step 7: once the personalization of the product is finished, the Java Card ID S OS is switched to its
       proprietary native mode usage of the TOE by the personalizer. Native mode switches off GP and
       identification commands to disallow tracking of the end user.

  7             Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)

  7.1           TOE Security Functional Requirements
 The security functional requirements (SFR) for this TOE are defined in this chapter.
This ST covers the three PPs [PP_SAC], [PP_EAC] and [PP_BAC] each two of which have a non empty
intersection of SFRs. In the rest of this section we provide a classification of the SFRs of these PPs depending on
where these SFRs are declared and if they need a refinement here in this ST.
 Table 1 lists all SFRs appearing both in [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC].
 Table 2 lists all SFRs declared in [PP_SAC].
Table 3 lists all SFRs specific to [PP_BAC]. Note that some of the SFRs appear in both [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC]
with same name but different content. In such cases the SFR is iterated with either the extension …/BAC or
…/PACE.
Table 4 lists all SFRs specific to [PP_EAC]. Note that [PP_EAC] is an extension of [PP_SAC], therefore all SFRs of
[PP_SAC] are SFRs in [PP_EAC], i.e. the SFRs listed in Table 3 and Table 4 are also SFRs of [PP_EAC].
Table 5 lists the SFRs introduced in this ST which are related to the Active Authentication mechanism
supported by the TOE.

7.1.1                About the Application Notes in this ST
Note that if an SFR has application notes as per the PPs [PP_SAC], [PP_EAC] and [PP_BAC] then these
application notes apply and can be found in the respective PPs.
Some SFRs contain additional application notes to ease the understanding of the specificities of this TOE.
These application notes do not come from the PPs and are prefixed with [IFX specific].



7.1.2                Common SFRs from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC]

7.1.2.1              Class FCS: Cryptographic Support




  FCS_CKM.4                Cryptographic key destruction – Session keys

  Hierarchical to:         No other components.

  Dependencies:            [FDP_ITC.1 Import of user data without security attributes, or FDP_ITC.2 Import of
                           user data with security attributes, or FCS_CKM.1 Cryptographic key generation]:
                           fulfilled by FCS_CKM.1 in case of BAC;
                           fulfilled by FCS_CKM.1/DH_PACE in case of PACE

  FCS_CKM.4.1              The TSF shall destroy cryptographic keys in accordance with a specified
                           cryptographic key destruction method overwriting the key values with random
                           values that meets the following: none

                           Application note 19 of [PP_BAC] and application note 28 of [PP_SAC] are both
 [IFX specific]            applicable for this SFR. There is no contradiction between the two application
 Application Note:         notes. While the application note from [PP_BAC] simply requests the encryption
                           and message authentication keys to be destroyed, the application note from
                           [PP_SAC] provides more detailed requests, when the session keys have to be
                           destroyed. Therefore FCS_CKM.4 from [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC] can be combined.

 FCS_RND.1                Quality metric for random numbers

 Hierarchical to:         No other components.

 Dependencies:            No dependencies.

 FCS_RND.1.1              The TSF shall provide a mechanism to generate random numbers that meet
                          Random numbers generation Class PTG.3 according to [AIS31]

 [IFX specific]           There is no contradiction between application note 24 of [PP_BAC] and application
 Application Note:        note 31 of [PP_SAC]. Both application notes shall apply and therefore FCS_RND.1
                          from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be combined, i.e. the random numbers shall be
                          used for the PACE, BAC and the authentication mechanism based on Triple-DES (as
                          defined in FIA_UAU.4/PACE and FIA_UAU.4).




7.1.2.2             Class FMT Security Management

 FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA        Management of TSF data – Writing Initialisation and Pre-personalisation Data

 Hierarchical to:         No other components.

 Dependencies:            FMT_SMF.1 Specification of management functions: fulfilled by FMT_SMF.1 for
                          PACE; fulfilled by FMT_SMF.1/BAC for BAC
                          FMT_SMR.1 Security roles: fulfilled by FMT_SMR.1/PACE for PACE; fulfilled by
                          FMT_SMR.1 for BAC

 FMT_MTD.1.1/INI_ENA      The TSF shall restrict the ability to write the Initialisation Data and Pre-
                          personalisation Data to the Manufacturer.

 [IFX specific]           The application note 42 of [PP_BAC] applies. This application note provides a
 Application Note:        definition, what is meant by “Pre-Personalisation Data”. This definition is also
                          applicable to FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA from [PP_SAC]. Therefore FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA
                          from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be combined.

7.1.2.3             Class FPT Protection of the Security Functions


 FPT_TST.1                TSF testing

 Hierarchical to:         No other components.

 Dependencies:            No dependencies.

 FPT_TST.1.1              The TSF shall run a suite of self tests during initial start-up, to demonstrate the
                          correct operation of the TSF.

 FPT_TST.1.2              The TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to verify the integrity of
                          the TSF data.

 FPT_TST.1.3              The TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to verify the integrity of
                          stored TSF executable code.



 [IFX specific]           There is no contradiction between application note 46 of [PP_BAC] and application
                          note 52 of [PP_SAC]. In fact, although the wording is slightly different, the meaning
 Application Note:
                          of these application notes is identical. Therefore either of these application notes
                          applies and FPT_TST.1 from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be combined.




 FPT_PHP.3                Resistance to physical attack

 Hierarchical to:         No other components.

 Dependencies:            No dependencies.

 FPT_PHP.3.1              The TSF shall resist physical manipulation and physical probing to the TSF by
                          responding automatically such that the SFRs are always enforced.

 [IFX specific]           Application note 47 of [PP_BAC] and 53 of [PP_SAC] are equivalent. Application
                          note 48 of [PP_BAC] is only informative to the reader in the sense, that it provides a
 Application Note:
                          context to an older CC standard, but not relevant for the interpretation of
                          FPT_PHP.3. Therefore either application note 47 of [PP_BAC] or application note 53
                          of [PP_SAC] applies and FPT_PHP.3 from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be combined.

                       Assets are security-relevant elements to be directly protected by the TOE. Confidentiality
                       of assets is always intended with respect to un-trusted people or software, as various
                       parties are involved during the first stages of the smart card product life-cycle. Details
                       concerning the threats are given in Section 4.2 "Threats" hereafter.
                       Assets have to be protected, some in terms of confidentiality and some in terms of
                       integrity or both integrity and confidentiality. These assets might get compromised by the
                       threats that the TOE is exposed to.
                       The assets to be protected by the TOE are listed below. They are grouped according to
                       whether it is data created by and for the user (User data) or data created by and for the
                       TOE (TSF data). This definition of grouping is taken from Section 5.1 of [6].

                        Modification of the correct OS behavior by unauthorized use of TOE or use of incorrect
                        or unauthorized instructions or commands or sequence of commands, in order to obtain
                        an unauthorized execution of the TOE code. An attacker may cause a malfunction of TSF
                        or of the Smart Card embedded OS in order to (1) by-pass the security mechanisms (i.e.
                        authentication or access control mechanisms) or (2) obtain unexpected result from the
                        embedded OS behavior. Different kind of attack path may be used as:
                        1. Applying incorrect unexpected or unauthorized instructions, commands or command
                           sequences,
                        2. Provoking insecure state by insertion of interrupt (reset), premature termination of
                           transaction or communication between IC and the reading device.
                        Info: Any implementation flaw in the OS itself can be exploited with this attack path
                        to lead to an unsecured state of the state machine of the OS. The attacker uses the
                        available interfaces of the TOE. A user could have certain specified privileges that allow
                        loading of selected programs. Unauthorized programs, if allowed to be loaded, may
                        include either the execution of legitimate programs not intended for use during normal
                        operation (such as patches, filters, Trojan horses, etc.) or the unauthorized loading of
                        programs specifically targeted at penetration or modification of the security functions.
                        Attempts to generate a non-secure state in the Smart Card may also be made through
                        premature termination of transactions or communications between the IC and the card
                        reading device, by insertion of interrupts, or by selecting related applications that may
                        leave files open.

                  4.2.5 Random Numbers

                 4.2.5.1 T.RND: Deficiency of Random Numbers

                        An attacker may predict or obtain information about random numbers generated by
                        the TOE for instance because of a lack of entropy of the random numbers provided.
                        An attacker may gather information about the produced random numbers which might
                        be a problem because they may be used for instance to generate cryptographic keys.
                        Here the attacker is expected to take advantage of statistical properties of the random
                        numbers generated by the TOE without specific knowledge about the TOE’s generator.
                        Malfunctions or premature ageing are also considered which may assist in getting
                        information about random numbers.

                  4.2.6 Configuration Module

                 4.2.6.1 T.CONFIG: Unauthorized configuration

                        The attacker tries to change configuration items without authorization. Directly threatened
                        asset(s): D.CONFIG_ITEM.

                        An attacker may try to use malicious code placed in the Secure Box to modify the correct
                        behavior of the Operating System (OS). With the aim to

                   4.3 Organisational Security Policies

                  4.3.1 OSP.PROCESS-TOE: Identification of the TOE
                        An accurate identification must be established for the TOE. This requires that each
                        instantiation of the TOE carries this identification.

                  4.3.2 OSP.KEY-CHANGE: Security Domain Keys Change
                        The Application Provider (AP) shall change its initial security domain keys (APSD) before
                        any operation on its Security Domain.

                  4.3.3 OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS: Security Domains
                        Security domains can be dynamically created, deleted and blocked during usage phase
                        in post-issuance mode.

                  4.3.4 OSP.SECURE-BOX: Secure Box Border
                        Execution of untrusted native code shall be possible without any harm, manipulation, or
                        influence on other parts of the TOE.

                   4.4 Assumptions
                        Note that the assumption A.DELETION is excluded. The Card Manager is part of the
                        TOE and therefore the assumption is no longer relevant.

                  4.4.1 A.USE_DIAG: Usage of TOE’s Secure Communication Protocol by OE
                        It is assumed that the operational environment supports and uses the secure
                        communication protocols offered by the TOE.

                 4.4.2 A.USE_KEYS: Protected Storage of Keys Outside of TOE
                       It is assumed that the keys which are stored outside the TOE and which are used for
                       secure communication and authentication between Smart Card and terminals are
                       protected for confidentiality and integrity in their own storage environment. This is
                       especially true for D.APSD_KEYS, D.ISD_KEYS, and D.VASD_KEYS.
                       Info: This is to assume that the keys used in terminals or systems are correctly
                       protected for confidentiality and integrity in their own environment, as the disclosure of
                       such information which is shared with the TOE but is not under the TOE control, may
                       compromise the security of the TOE.

                 4.4.3 A.PROCESS-SEC-IC: Protection during Packaging, Finishing and
                       Personalisation
                       It is assumed that security procedures are used after delivery of the TOE by the TOE
                       Manufacturer up to delivery to the end consumer to maintain confidentiality and integrity
                       of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test e PACE protocol shall be verified as being sent

                          FMT_MSA.3 Static attribute initialisation: not fulfilled, but justified
                          The access control TSF according to FDP_ACF.1/TRM uses security attributes
                          having been defined during the personalisation and fixed over the whole life time
                          of the TOE. No management of these security attributes (i.e. SFR FMT_MSA.1 and
                          FMT_MSA.3) is necessary here.

 FDP_ACF.1.1/TRM          The TSF shall enforce the Access Control SFP to objects based on the following:
                          1. Subjects:

                          controlled subjects and controlled objects is allowed:
                          1. A BIS-PACE is allowed to read data objects from FDP_ACF.1/TRM according to
                             [ICAO_SAC] after a successful PACE authentication as required by
                             FIA_UAU.1/PACE.

                           The Micro Controller Firmware is used for testing of the Micro Controller at production,
                           for booting of the Micro Controller after power-up or after reset, for configuration of
                           communication devices and for writing data to volatile and non-volatile memory.
                           The MC FW has been certified together with the Micro Controller and the same reference

                 1.3.1.2.2 Crypto Library

                           The Crypto Library provides implementations for symmetric and asymmetric
                           cryptographic operations, hashing, the generation of hybrid deterministic and hybrid
                           physical random numbers and further functions like secure copy and compare.
                           Some of the cryptographic algorithms offered by the Crypto Lib are not certified, see
                           Section 1.3.1.4 "Excluded functionality".
                           The symmetric cryptographic operations comprise the algorithms 3DES and AES. These
                           algorithms use the symmetric co-processor of the Micro Controller.

                          The OS of the TOE consists of JCVM, JCRE, JCAPI and GP framework. It is
                          implemented according to the Java Card Specification and GlobalPlatform. Additionally it
                          consists of a proprietary API, which is described in the UGM [9].
                          The TOE can be identified by using the IDENTIFY APDU command (see UGM [9]). This
                          command returns the card identification data, which includes a Platform ID, a Patch ID
                          and other information that allows to identify the content in ROM, FLASH and loaded
                          patches (if any).
                          The TOE also includes a Configuration Module (see Section 1.3.2 "Optional TOE
                          Functionality") which is used for personalisation and configuration of the TOE. It must be
                          deleted after the personalisation is finished (end of Phase 6 ”Personalisation”) by using
                          the DELETE APDU command. Once the Configuration Module is deleted, it is no longer

                         NXP Secure Smart Card Controller P6022M VB/P6022D VB/P6022J VB is manufactured
                         in an advanced 90nm CMOS technology. The block diagram of the IC hardware platform
                         of P6022M VB/P6022D VB/P6022J VB is depicted in Fig. 1.
                         The P6022M VB/P6022D VB/P6022J VB contains the IC hardware platform (see Fig. 1)
                         and the IC Dedicated Software which is composed of IC Dedicated Test Software and
                         IC Dedicated Support Software including MIFARE Software. All other software is called
                         Security IC Embedded Software. The Security IC Embedded Software is not part of the
                         P6022M VB/P6022D VB/P6022J VB.
                         This Security Target claims conformance to the assurance package EAL6 augmented for
                         the P6022M VB/P6022D VB/P6022J VB. Please refer Section 2.2 for details.
                         MIFARE functionality does not implement any Security Functional Requirement and its
                         functionality is therefore not in the scope of the evaluation and does not interfere with the
                         security functionality provided by the IC hardware platform.

reader/writer (proximity coupling
        device, terminal). The transmission protocol meets [ISO/IEC 14443-3] and [ISO/IEC 14443-4] Type B.
   -    The contact based interface ISO 7816-3 supported for the purposes of eID and eDL.
   -    The command interface to the TOE is provided by the ePassport Application.



2.6.3              Package Types
The TOE package types and formats are exactly the same as for the underlying Java Card OS. The package
types and formats of the Java Card OS Secora ID S are described in [ST_JC_ID_S_Platform], section 1.4.3 and
1.4.6.


2.6.4              Lifecycle and Delivery
The [PP_EAC], [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC] define the lifecycle phases for the TOE as follows:
1. Development
   - Step 1: Development of hardware and IC dedicated software (firmware)

2. Manufacturing
   - Step 3: manufacturing of IC and IC dedicated software. As the TOE does not provide any user ROM,
       manufacturing of IC embedded software parts in ROM are not relevant here.
   - Step 4 (optional): Combination of IC with contactless interface of the travel document
   - Step 5 (Prepersonalization): loading on the device of the executable Java Card OS image. Loading of
       the application JC package containing the TOE code, eDL and eID code.
3. Personalisation of Travel Document
   - Step 6: this step is performed by the customer. The customer receives from Infineon the TOE
       composed of the following components:
           o The underlying hardware
           o The underlying Java Card OS can be in two possible modes: either in the standard Java Card
                open mode (loading and installation of applets are possible) or in the proprietary Java Card
                static mode (preloaded by Infineon packages can be installed, applet loading is not possible).
           o The cap file of SECORA™ ID S Applet Infineon Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0 is preloaded by
                Infineon.
           o The customer then proceeds to installing the ePassport configuration of SECORA™ ID S Infineon
                Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0 and optionally installing the ISO/EU eDL or eID. In case the
                Secora ID S is in open mode the customer can load and install 3rd party applets. During this step
                the customer also performs the personalisation with biometric data and configuration of the
                TSF if necessary.
4. Operational Use
   - Step 7: once the personalization of the product is finished, the Java Card ID S OS is switched to its
       proprietary native mode usage of the TOE by the personalizer. Native mode switches off GP and
       identification commands to disallow tracking of the end user.

  7             Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)

  7.1           TOE Security Functional Requirements
 The security functional requirements (SFR) for this TOE are defined in this chapter.
This ST covers the three PPs [PP_SAC], [PP_EAC] and [PP_BAC] each two of which have a non empty
intersection of SFRs. In the rest of this section we provide a classification of the SFRs of these PPs depending on
where these SFRs are declared and if they need a refinement here in this ST.
 Table 1 lists all SFRs appearing both in [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC].
 Table 2 lists all SFRs declared in [PP_SAC].
Table 3 lists all SFRs specific to [PP_BAC]. Note that some of the SFRs appear in both [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC]
with same name but different content. In such cases the SFR is iterated with either the extension …/BAC or
…/PACE.
Table 4 lists all SFRs specific to [PP_EAC]. Note that [PP_EAC] is an extension of [PP_SAC], therefore all SFRs of
[PP_SAC] are SFRs in [PP_EAC], i.e. the SFRs listed in Table 3 and Table 4 are also SFRs of [PP_EAC].
Table 5 lists the SFRs introduced in this ST which are related to the Active Authentication mechanism
supported by the TOE.

7.1.1                About the Application Notes in this ST
Note that if an SFR has application notes as per the PPs [PP_SAC], [PP_EAC] and [PP_BAC] then these
application notes apply and can be found in the respective PPs.
Some SFRs contain additional application notes to ease the understanding of the specificities of this TOE.

                           [PP_SAC] provides more detailed requests, when the session keys have to be
                           destroyed. Therefore FCS_CKM.4 from [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC] can be combined.

                          Table 8. The availability of minor configuration options partly depends on the selected major
                          configuration option. However, in general the minor configuration options can be chosen
                          independently.
                1.4.2.3     Post Delivery Configuration
                          Post Delivery Configuration (PDC) can be applied by the customer himself after the TOE
                          has been delivered to that customer. These options can be used to tailor the TOE to the
                          specific customer requirements. The Post Delivery Configuration can be changed multiple
                          times but must be set permanently by the customer before the TOE is delivered to phase 7
                          of the life cycle.
                          The Post Delivery Configuration for the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF is listed in Table
                          9.

                          By applying Post Delivery Configuration the Security Rows content is updated for the
                          changed configuration options and can therefore be used for identification of the TOE after
                          applying any Post Delivery Configuration. Further details regarding Security Rows content
                          and identification of the TOE after applying Post Delivery Configuration refer to [9].
                          The Post Delivery Configuration can be accessed using chip health mode functionality in
                          combination with the ISO/IEC 7816 contact interface.

                          A number of package types are supported for each major configuration of the TOE. The
                          commercial types are named according to the following format.
                            • P60D024ypp(p)/9Brrff(o) for major configuration P60D024PVB(Y/Z/A)/MVB(Y/Z/A)

                            • P60D012ypp(p)/9Frrff(o) for major configuration P60D012yVF
                          The commercial type name of each major configuration varies with the package type as
                          indicated by the variable pp and with the Security IC Embedded Software as indicated by
                          the variables rr and ff. Variable y identifies the activation of the firmware emulations.
                          Variable o identifies the EEPROM size of MIFARE Software. The number 9 is used as Fab
                          identifier and B/F references to the silicon version also available at major configuration
                          naming as VB/VF. The variables are replaced according to the rules in Table 10.

                       Table 11 depicts the package types, which are supported in this Security Target, and
                       assigns these to the major configurations. The two characters in each entry of the table
                       stand for the variable pp, and identify the package type. An empty cell means that the
                       Security Target does not support the respective package type for the corresponding major
                       configuration.

                                                                    identifies the module type)

                                                                    type and the package type inside the inlay.)


                       For example, commercial type name P60D024PX0/9Brrff denotes major configuration
                       P60D024yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF in PDM1.1 dual interface smart card module. The characters ‘rr’
                       and ‘ff’ are individual for each customer product.
                       The package types do not influence the security functionality of the TOE. They only define
                       which pads are connected in the package and for what purpose and in which environment
                       the chip can be used. Note that the security of the TOE is not dependent on which pad is
                       connected or not - the connections just define how the product can be used. If the TOE is
                       delivered as wafer the customer can choose the connections on his own.
                       Security during development and production is ensured for all package types listed above,
                       for details refer to section 1.4.4.
                       The commercial type name identifies major configuration and package type of the TOE as
                       well as the Security IC Embedded Software. However, the commercial type name does not
                       itemize the minor configuration options of the TOE, which are introduced in section 1.4.2.2.
                       Instead, minor configuration options are identified in the Order Entry Form, which is
                       assigned to the ROM code number and the FabKey number of the commercial type name.

                  1.4.3 Logical Scope of TOE
                1.4.3.1     Hardware Description
                          The CPU of the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF supports a 32-/24-/16-/8-bit instruction
                          set and distinguishes five CPU modes, which are summarized in Table 12.

                          Table 12.    CPU modes of the TOE
                                            Super System Mode
                           Boot Mode            Test Mode                            Firmware Mode                     System Mode        User Mode

                          Boot Mode, Test Mode and Firmware Mode are sub-modes of the so-called Super System
                          Mode. These three modes are not available to the Security IC Embedded Software; they
                          are reserved for the Security IC Dedicated Software. The Security IC Dedicated Software is
                          composed of Security IC Dedicated Test Software and Security IC Dedicated Support
                          Software, (Boot-ROM Software and Firmware Operating System) as introduced in section
                          1.4.1. The three software components are mapped one-to-one to the three CPU modes: In
                          Boot Mode the TOE executes the Boot-ROM Software, in Test Mode the TOE executes the
                          IC Dedicated Test Software and in Firmware Mode the TOE executes the Firmware
                          Operating System. Please note that the Super System Mode is not a mode on its own:
                          When the TOE is in Super System Mode, it is always either in Boot Mode, Test Mode or
                          Firmware Mode.
                          The P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF is able to control two different logical phases. After
                          production of the Security IC every start-up or reset completes with Test Mode and
                          execution of the IC Dedicated Test Software. The Test Mode is disabled at the end of the
                          production test. Afterwards, every start-up or reset ends up in System Mode and execution
                          of the Security IC Embedded Software.
                          In case the minor configuration option ‘Post Delivery Configuration’ is enabled and not finally
                          locked by the customer, the resource configuration functionality allows the customer to
                          enable or disable specific functionality of the hardware platform, refer to Table 9.
                          In case the minor configuration option ‘Chip Health/Ident Mode’ is enabled, during the boot
                          process routines either starting built-in self tests checking the functional integrity of the TOE
                          or sending back identification items of the TOE can be activated by the user.
                          System Mode and User Mode are available to the developer of the Security IC Embedded
                          Software. System Mode has unlimited access to the hardware components available to the
                          Security IC Embedded Software. User Mode has restricted access to the CPU, specific
                          Special Function Registers and the memories depending on the access rights granted by
                          software running in System Mode. The hardware components are controlled by the Security
                          IC Embedded Software via Special Function Registers. Special Function Registers are
                          interrelated to the activities of the CPU, the Memory Management Unit, interrupt control, I/O
                          configuration, EEPROM, timers, UART, the contactless interface and the coprocessors.

NXP Semiconductors                                            P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF
                                                                                                                    Security Target Lite



                       The P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF provides two types of interrupts: (i) exception
                       interrupts, called “exception” in the following and (ii) event interrupts, called “interrupts” in
                       the following. Exceptions and interrupts each force a jump to a specific fixed vector address
                       in the ROM. Any exception and interrupt can therefore be controlled and guided by a specific
                       part     of     the    Security     IC     Embedded       Software.      In     addition,    the
                       P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF provides eight firmware vectors (FVEC) and 32 system
                       call vectors (SVEC). These vectors have to be explicitly called by the Security IC Embedded
                       Software. A jump to a firmware vector forces Firmware Mode and starts execution of the
                       Firmware Operating System, a jump to a system call vector forces System Mode.
                       The Watchdog timer is intended to abort irregular program executions by a time-out
                       mechanism and is enabled and configured by the Security IC Embedded Software.
                       The P60D024yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF incorporates 352 kBytes of ROM, 8.125 kBytes of RAM and

and against download of malicious software before, during and after the user downloads his software. This is
formalized with the objectives O.Cap_Avail_Loader, O.Authentication and O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader requiring
authentication of the TOE to external entities and a trusted communication channel. The O.Authentication
implements a mutual authentication and involves the environment therefore.
And the policies cover also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must be
regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.
The implemented mutual authentication requires first to authenticate the TOE to the external user. This requires
also knowledge by the user about the sequence of the protocol, interpretation of the transferred data and how to
start the authentication of the TOE. This authentication mean counters the threat T.Masquerade_TOE as only
the genuine TOE is able to identify itself correctly to the enabled user, which covers O.Authentication.
The second step of the mutual authentications mean implements the authentication of the user to the TOE. Only
the user enabled to present the correct authentication data and knowing about the sequence, data
interpretation and signaling of the authentication to the TOE is able to proceed further on.
This enforces OE.TOE_Auth, requiring the support of the verification mechanism and known authentication
reference data by the operational environment.

It is normal business that products enabled for software download by the user are either on their way to the user
or are already stored at user premises. At both situations it cannot be excluded that an attacker could manage to
steal such products enabled for software downloads. The ability to download software on a chip without
operating system and/or application is defined as open sample.
This situation generates the threat T.Open_Samples_Diffusion which is defined as follows:
The download of analysis software could enable an attacker to characterize the product and to construct an
attack path out of the gained information.
This threat is countered by the Flash Loader by following rational:
As long as the Flash Loader is active, controlled usage to the Flash Loader functionality (P.Ctrl_Loader) is
enforced which protects the TOE from achieving the status of being an open sample. And more, even the
attacker could observe, meaning in the sense of measurements during, or induce faults during an authorized
download, the Flash Loader protects the user data of the download by confidentiality and integrity protection
means. The Flash Loader functionalities of mutual authentication, establishing a dedicated trusted
communication channel, the encryption and integrity protection means cover the objectives
O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality, O.Leak-Inherent and O.Leak-Forced.
The policy P.Ctrl_Loader covers also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1
