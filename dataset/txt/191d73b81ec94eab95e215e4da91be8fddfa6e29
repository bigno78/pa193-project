                                                                                                                      Security Target Lite



                       The IC hardware platform P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF is a microcontroller
                       incorporating a central processing unit, memories accessible via a Memory Management
                       Unit, cryptographic coprocessors, other security components and two communication
                       interfaces. The central processing unit supports a 32-/24-/16-/8-bit instruction set optimized
                       for smart card applications, which is a super set of the 80C51 family instruction set. The first
                       and in some cases the second byte of an instruction are used for operation encoding. On-
                       chip memories are ROM, RAM and EEPROM. The non-volatile EEPROM can be used as
                       data or program memory. It consists of high reliable memory cells, which guarantee data
                       integrity. The EEPROM is optimized for applications requiring reliable non-volatile data
                       storage for data and program code. EEPROM double read function is included for correct
                       memory readout. Dedicated security functionality protects the contents of all memories.
                       The security functionality of the TOE is designed to act as an integral part of a complete
                       security system in order to strengthen the design as a whole. Several security mechanisms
                       are completely implemented in and controlled by the TOE. Other security mechanisms allow
                       for configuration or even require handling of exceptions by the Security IC Embedded
                       Software. The different CPU modes and the Memory Management Unit support the
                       implementation of multi-application projects using the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF.
                       A Security IC must provide high security in particular when being used in the banking and
                       finance market, in electronic commerce or in governmental applications because the TOE
                       is intended to be used in a potential insecure environment. Hence the TOE shall maintain
                           ‚Ä¢ the integrity and the confidentiality of code and data stored in its memories and
                           ‚Ä¢ the different CPU modes with the related capabilities for configuration and memory
                             access and
                           ‚Ä¢ the integrity, the correct operation and the confidentiality of security functionality
                             provided by the TOE.
                       This is ensured by the construction of the TOE and its security functionality.
                       P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF basically provides a hardware platform for an
                       implementation of a smart card application with
                           ‚Ä¢ functionality to calculate the Data Encryption Standard (Triple-DES) with up to three
                             keys,
                           ‚Ä¢ functionality to calculate the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with different key
                             lengths,
                           ‚Ä¢ support for large integer arithmetic operations like multiplication, addition and logical
                             operations, which are suitable for public key cryptography and elliptic curve
                             cryptography,
                           ‚Ä¢ a True Random Number Generator,
                           ‚Ä¢ memory management control,
                           ‚Ä¢ cyclic redundancy check (CRC) calculation,
                           ‚Ä¢ ISO/IEC 7816 contact interface with UART,
                           ‚Ä¢ ISO/IEC 14443 A contactless interface.
                       In addition, several security mechanisms are implemented to ensure proper operation as
                       well as integrity and confidentiality of stored data. For example, this includes security
                       mechanisms for memory protection and security exceptions as well as sensors, which allow

                       operation under specified conditions only. Memory encryption is used for memory protection
                       and chip shielding is added to the chip.
                       Note:        Large integer arithmetic operations are intended to be used for calculation of
                                    asymmetric cryptographic algorithms. Any asymmetric cryptographic
                                    algorithm utilizing the support for large integer arithmetic operations has to be
                                    implemented in the Security IC Embedded Software. Thus, the support for
                                    large integer arithmetic operations itself does not provide security functionality
                                    like cryptographic support. The Security IC Embedded Software implementing
                                    an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm is not included in this evaluation.
                                    Nevertheless the support for large integer arithmetic operations is part of the
                                    Security IC and therefore a security relevant component of the TOE, that must
                                    resist to the attacks mentioned in this Security Target and that must operate
                                    correctly as specified in the data sheet. The same scope of evaluation is
                                    applied to the CRC calculation.

                       The P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF is provided as IC hardware platform for various

                       The Security IC Embedded Software is not part of the TOE.
                       The IC Dedicated Support Software consists of Boot-ROM Software controlling the boot
                       process of the hardware platform and the Firmware Operating System which can be called
                       by the Security IC Embedded Software.
                       The Firmware Operating System for the hardware platform is called the Plain Firmware
                       Operating System (FOS-Plain) and the Firmware Operating System for the MIFARE
                       Software Emulation is called the Emulation Firmware Operating System (FOS- Emu).
                       The FOS-Plain provides an interface for programming of the internal EEPROM memory,
                       which is mandatory for use by the Security IC Embedded Software when programming the
                       EEPROM memory. Furthermore FOS-Plain provides an interface for the Post Delivery
                       Configuration functionality.
                       All configurations other than P60D024/016/012P include emulation MIFARE Plus
                       MF1PLUSx0 or MIFARE DESFire EV1 in the FOS-Emu. These emulations are represented
                       by the term MIFARE Software in this document. Note that MIFARE Software is not part of
                       the TOE (see Fig 2).

                              Release VB(Y) can be identified by ROM Code number xxx in the range of 005 to 013 and 092 to 095. All
                                 other ROM Code numbers are assigned to version VB(Z) and VB(A). The ROM code number can
                                 unambiguously identified by reading Security Row bytes RCN0 (DFFF8A) and RCN1 (DFF8B), see [9].
                                 In addition the ROM Code number is physically visible on the dice surface according to [12]. Releases
                                 VB(Z), and VB(A) share the same underlying hardware, but were adapted for yield improvement
                                 compared to VB(Y). Compared to Release VB(Z) the release VB(A) introduces additional configuration
                                 option. Releases VB(Z), and VB(A) can be distinguished by the Device Coding of ‚ÄúNXP option of

                            EEPROM characteristics‚Äù in OEF, see [9]. Hardware VB(Y) is restricted to Version 05.00 only.
                       5
                         Release VB(Y) can be identified by ROM Code number xxx in the range of 005 to 013 and 092 to 095. All
                            other ROM Code numbers are assigned to version VB(Z) and VB(A). The ROM code number can
                            unambiguously identified by reading Security Row bytes RCN0 (DFFF8A) and RCN1 (DFF8B), see [9].
                            In addition, the ROM Code number is physically visible on the dice surface according to [12]. Releases
                            VB(Z), and VB(A) share the same underlying hardware, but were adapted for yield improvement
                            compared to VB(Y). Compared to Release VB(Z) the release VB(A) introduces additional configuration
                            option. Releases VB(Z), and VB(A) can be distinguished by the Device Coding of ‚ÄúNXP option of
                            PATDET configuration selection‚Äù in DC4 (‚Äúinitial‚Äù for VB(Z), ‚Äúa‚Äù for VB(A), see [9].

                         Release VF contains update of for EEPROM start-up circuit for yield improvement. Release VF can be
                            identified by check of the silicon version code VMSK according to section 4.2 in [12]: h46 for VF
                            (others have VMSK value: h42).

                           by Security IC Embedded Software using FVEC interface as specified in [9], section 13.4.1
                           Emulation Control Interface (FVEC0).


                 1.4.2 Evaluated configurations
                           The customer can select different logical configurations of the TOE. The configuration
                           options are structured as major and minor configuration options.


                 1.4.2.1        Major configuration options
                           The major configurations of the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF are given in Table 1. All
                           major configurations are equipped with an EEPROM of 24 kBytes and both, the ISO/IEC
                           7816 contact interface and the ISO/IEC 14443 contactless interface. Their major differences
                           are related to the availability of EEPROM space. The ‚Äò024‚Äô, ‚Äò016‚Äô and ‚Äò012‚Äô specify the
                           accessible EEPROM memory.
                           The ‚Äòy‚Äô indicates the selection of the Firmware Operating System (FOS). It is a placeholder for
                           either ‚ÄòP‚Äô, ‚ÄòM‚Äô or ‚ÄòD‚Äô:
                                  ‚Ä¢    ‚ÄòP‚Äô indicates the absence of FOS-Emu
                                  ‚Ä¢    ‚ÄòM‚Äô indicates FOS-Emu with MIFARE Plus MF1PLUSx0
                           7
                               Version 06.12 and version 06.13 include extensions on top of

                       and Table 5).
                       One major difference between the major configurations is related to the availability of
                       EEPROM space to the Security IC Embedded Software:

1.4.2.3   Documentation
Refer to Section 1.4.1 for the documentation, which forms part of the TOE delivery.

1.4.3     Security during Development and Production
During the design, the layout process of the IC and the development of the software only people involved in the
specific development project have access to sensitive data. The security measures installed within NXP ensure a
secure computer system and provide appropriate equipment for the different development tasks.
The developers of NXP Semiconductors, Business Unit Security & Connectivity provide the verified layout data
directly to the wafer fab. The wafer fab generates and forwards the layout data related to the different photo masks
to the manufacturer of the photo masks. The photo masks are generated off-site and verified against the design
data of the development before the usage. The accountability and the traceability is ensured among the wafer fab
and the photo mask provider.
The test process of every die is performed by a test centre of NXP. Delivery processes between the involved
sites provide accountability and traceability of the produced wafers. NXP embeds the die into specific modules
(as stated in section 1.4.1.1), based on customer demand. Information about non-functional items is stored
on magnetic/optical media enclosed with the delivery, available for download or the non-functional items are
physically marked.
In summary, the TOE can be delivered in two different forms:

     ‚Ä¢ Diced dies on wafers
     ‚Ä¢ Modules on a module reel

1.4.4     Life Cycle and Delivery of the TOE
The life-cycle phases are according to the standard life-cycle for Security IC products as detailed in the Protection
Profile (see section 2.4 for details), Section 1.2.4:

     ‚Ä¢ Phase 1: IC Embedded Software Development

     ‚Ä¢ Phase 2: IC Development

     ‚Ä¢ Phase 3: IC Manufacturing

     ‚Ä¢ Phase 4: IC Packaging

     ‚Ä¢ Phase 5: Composite Product Integration

     ‚Ä¢ Phase 6: Personalisation

     ‚Ä¢ Phase 6a (Optional): Finalization of the personalization

     ‚Ä¢ Phase 7: Operational Usage

During TOE packaging TOE will be embedded either in a plastic inlay (plastic layer containing printed or wired
antenna) for direct antenna connection or in one of the supported package types (MOA4 or MOA8). The module
and card embedding of the TOE provide external security mechanisms because they make it harder for an
attacker to access parts of the TOE for physical manipulation.


Regarding the Application Note 1 of the Protection Profile, NXP will deliver the TOE at the end of Phase 6 in
delivery form listed in Section 1.4.1.1. Therefore, the TOE evaluation perimeter comprising the development and
production environment of the TOE, consists of life-cycle phases 1 - 6. The TOE is fully integrated composite
product is comprised of the underlying security IC HW combined with the embedded software developed by NXP.
Therefore, the Phase 5 is fully under control of NXP and does not involve data exchange with other parties.


The developer also provides a commercial option to configure the TOE on behalf of the customer in order to
personalize before the usage. Alternatively, the customer can also finalize the partially personalized TOE after
delivery. In case that all required security anchors (key material) are already installed during personalization by
NXP, the customer can finalize the personalization of the file system content relying on the operational security
features of the TOE.


The TOE Software is embedded in the TOE during the TOE evaluation perimeter (life-cycle phases 1 - 6)
and the TOE does not allow the modification of installation of any piece of IC Embedded Software after TOE
delivery. Moreover, the TOE is being locked to the user operating mode before TOE delivery at the end of Phase 6.

The TOE is able to control different logical phases. After production of the chip every start-up will lead to the initial
operating mode. In the initial operating mode the production test shall be performed and the TOE is trimmed
and initialized. The selection of the required variant is part of the initialization. At the end of the production test,
the access to the test and initialization software is disabled. Subsequent start-ups of the chip will always enter
the user operating mode with the CPU executing the TOE operating system software. The TOE will stay in the
user operating mode until the end of its life-time. In exceptional cases, which impact the integrity of the TOE in
a non-recoverable way (typically if the TOE configuration is corrupted or TOE faces physical damage) the TOE
switches into the mute or freeze operating mode. In those modes the TOE is effectively unusable.



1.4.5     TOE Intended Usage
The TOE user environment is the environment from TOE Delivery to Phase 7. At the phases up to 6, the TOE
user environment must be a controlled environment. The only exception is that customer specific keys can be
installed using trust provisioning services in Phase 6. In this case the customer can finalize the personalization
in the subsequent personalization finalization Phase 6a already relying on the TOE provided operational security
services. Regarding to Phase 7, the TOE is used by the end-user. The method of use of the product in this phase
depends on the application. The TOE is intended to be used in an unsecured environment that does not avoid a
threat.


The device is developed for security relevant applications that require protection against enhanced-basic attack
potential. In case that additional resistance against a high-attack potential is required, the MIFARE product
portfolio also offers stronger alternatives (like MIFARE DESFire EV2). The product is designed for embedding
into contactless integrated circuit cards according to ISO 14443 [10][12][13][11]. Usually the TOE is assigned to
a single individual only and can be used for a single application only. The secret data shall be used as input for
the calculation of authentication data, encryption and integrity protection of data for communication.

In the end-user environment (Phase 7) Security ICs are used in a wide range of applications to assure authorized
conditional access. Examples of such are transportation or access management. The end-user environment
therefore covers a wide spectrum of very different functions, thus making it difficult to avoid and monitor any
abuse attempts of the TOE.


The system integrators such as the terminal software developer may use samples of the TOE during the develop-
ment phases for their testing purposes. These samples do not differ from the TOE, they do not have any additional
functionality used for testing.
Remark 2. The phases from TOE Delivery to Phase 7 of the Security IC life cycle are not part of the TOE
construction process in the sense of this Security Target. Information about those phases is just included to
describe how the TOE is used after its construction. The security features of the TOE cannot be disabled in these

1.4.6     Interface of the TOE
The pads to connect the RF antenna form the electrical interface of the TOE.


The functional interface is defined by the commands implemented by the TOE and described in datasheets listed
in Table 1 within Section 1.4.1.


The chip surface can be seen as an interface of the TOE, too. This interface must be taken into account regarding
environmental stress e.g. like temperature and in the case of an attack where the attacker e.g. manipulates the
chip surface.

2        Conformance Claims
2.1        CC Conformance Claim
This Security Target claims to be conformant to the Common Criteria version 3.1, Revision 5:

     ‚Ä¢ Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 1 ‚Äì Introduction and general model -
         Version 3.1 CCMB-2017-04-001, Revision 5, April 2017, [2]

         Version 3.1 CCMB-2017-04-003, Revision 5, April 2017, [4]

For the evaluation the following methodology will be used:

     ‚Ä¢ Common Methodology for Information Technology Security Evaluation ‚Äì Evaluation Methodology, Version
         3.1 CCMB-2017-04-004, Revision 5, April 2017, [5]

This Security Target claims to be CC Part 2 extended and CC Part 3 conformant. The extended Security Func-
tional Requirements are defined in chapter 6.


2.2        Package Claim
This Security Target claims conformance to the assurance level EAL4, which in particular includes the resistance
against an enhanced-basic attack potential (as implied by the inclusion of AVA_VAN.3).


2.3        PP Claim
This Security Target does not claim conformance to any Protection Profile.


2.4        Conformance Claim Rationale
Even though this Security Target does not claim conformance to any Protection Profile, the general modelling
approach of the security problem definition and the structure of the security functional requirements have been
taken from the Security IC Platform Protection Profile with Augmentation Packages [9]. Whenever referring to
‚ÄôProtection Profile‚Äô, the reader of this Security Target must be aware about section 2.3 and the current section.


The TOE is a similar product-type (embedded software running on a security IC intended to be embedded in one
of the different package types stated in section 1.4.1.1). The primary difference is in the claimed attack resistance
level, which is justified by the value of the assets protected by the TOE. A second difference is that the Protection
Profile formulates the security objectives for the security IC form the perspective of a generic platform protecting

arbitrary kinds of embedded software implementations. In contrast, the TOE is evaluated as a combination of a
hardware platform together with the an Operating System (OS) functionality.


Therefore, the following modifications and precisions for the TOE use-case have been made: The assumption
A.Resp-Appl and the related objective for the TOE environment OE.Resp-Appl have not been taken from the
Protection Profile because they formulate assumptions on the behaviour of the embedded-software, which is for
the platform part of the TOE and not of the environment of the TOE.

3        Security Problem Definition
Although this Security Target does not claim conformance to any Protection Profile, the general modelling ap-
proach of the security problem definition and the structure of the security functional requirements have been
taken over from the Protection Profile. The only deviation is explained in section 2.4. In the following paragraphs
only the extensions of the different sections are detailed. The elements of the Security Problem Definition that are
not extended in the Security Target are not repeated in this Security Target, they are cited here for completeness
only.


3.1        Description of Assets
The assets, which are related to the high-level concerns defined in Section 3.1 of the Protection Profile, are related
to standard functionality and are applied in this Security Target. The high-level concerns are cited in the following:

     ‚Ä¢ Integrity and confidentiality of User Data stored and in operation. More concretely, the user-data com0rises
         the data and key material contained in files in the file system, customer configurable configuration options,
         as well as NXP configuration data and other administrative information that ensures proper operation of the
         operating system.
     ‚Ä¢ Integrity and confidentiality of UID depending on configuration
     ‚Ä¢ Integrity of the Security IC Embedded Software, stored and in operation,
     ‚Ä¢ Correct operation of the Security Services provided by the TOE for the Security IC Embedded Software,
     ‚Ä¢ Deficiency of random numbers.

To be able to protect the assets based on these concerns, the TOE shall protect its security functionality. There-
fore, critical information about the TOE shall be protected. Critical information includes:

     ‚Ä¢ Logical design data, physical design data, IC Dedicated Software, Security IC Embedded Software and
         configuration data.
     ‚Ä¢ Initialization Data and Pre-personalization Data, specific development aids, test and characterization related
         data, material for software development support, and photo masks.

Observe that the protection requirements for the assets are defined by the assumed enhanced-basic attack po-
tential and as such can be often lower than for products aiming at resisting against an attacker with a high attack
potential. Also note that all assets valid for this TOE are considered when specifying the threats defined in the
subsequent section.


3.2        Threats
All threats, defined in section 3.2 of the Protection Profile, are valid for this Security Target. These threats are
listed in table 3.1. In addition the threat T.Masquerade_TOE is applicable for this TOE as stated below.

policies as detailed in the following.


The hardware and underlying firmware supplies security functionality which is further used by the operating
system software. In the following specific security functionality is listed, which is not derived from threats identified
for the TOE‚Äôs environment, because it can only be decided in the context of the specific application, against which
threats the TOE Software will use the specific security functionality.


The IC Developer / Manufacturer therefore applies the policies Confidentiality during communication, Integrity
during communication, Transaction mechanism and Un-traceability of end-users as specified below.

P.Encryption              Confidentiality during communication
                          The TOE shall provide the possibility to protect selected data elements from eavesdropping during
                          contactless communication.

P.MAC                     Integrity during communication
                          The TOE shall provide the possibility to protect the contactless communication from modification
                          or injections. This includes especially the possibility to detect replay or man-in-the-middle attacks
                          within a session.

P.Transaction             Transaction mechanism

                      The TOE shall provide the possibility to combine a number of data modification operations in one
                      transaction, so that either all operations or no operation at all is performed.

Remark 3. This policy is only relevant for MIFARE DESFire Light and MIFARE IDentity variants of the TOE.

P.No-Trace            Un-traceability of end-users
                      The TOE shall provide the ability that authorised subjects can prevent that end-user of TOE may be
                      traced by unauthorised subjects without consent. Tracing of end-users may happen by performing
                      a contactless communication with the TOE when the end-user is not aware of it. Typically this
                      involves retrieving the UID or any freely accessible data element.

Remark 4. This policy is only relevant for MIFARE DESFire Light and MIFARE IDentity variants of the TOE.

P.Tag-Tamper          Tag tamper detection
                      The TOE shall provide the possibility to detect and permanently record tampering status on the tag
                      tamper wire.

Remark 5. This policy is only relevant for the NTAG42xTf variant of the TOE.


3.4      Assumptions
One of the assumptions defined in Section 3.4 of the Protection Profile is taken over to this Security Target. These
assumptions are listed in Table 3.5. Section 2.2 clarifies the omitted assumptions with their reasoning.

          Name                                   Title

                             Tab. 3.5: Assumptions defined in the Security IC Protection Profile


In compliance with Application Notes 6 and 7 in the Protection Profile, this Security Target defines two additional
assumptions as follows.


A.Secure_Values       Usage of secure values
                      Only confidential and secure cryptographically strong keys shall be used to set up the authentica-
                      tion. These values are generated outside the TOE and they are downloaded to the TOE.

A.Terminal_Support    Terminal support to ensure integrity, confidentiality and use of random numbers
                      The terminal verifies information sent by the TOE in order to ensure integrity and confidentiality of
                      the communication. Furthermore the terminal shall provide random numbers according to AIS20
                      (see [14]) or AIS31 (see [15]) for the authentication.

These assumptions are summarized in Table 3.6.

These additional security objectives are specified as follows.
O.Access-Control          Access Control
                          The TOE must provide an access control mechanism for data stored by it. The access control
                          mechanism shall apply to read, modify, create and delete operations for data elements and to
                          reading and modifying security attributes as well as authentication data. It shall be possible to

                         limit the right to perform a specific operation to a specific user. The security attributes (keys)
                         used for authentication shall never be output.

O.Authentication         Authentication
                         The TOE must provide an authentication mechanism in order to be able to authenticate autho-
                         rised users. The authentication mechanism shall be resistant against replay and man-in-the-
                         middle attacks.

O.Encryption             Confidential Communication
                         The TOE must be able to protect the communication by encryption. This shall be implemented
                         by security attributes that enforce encrypted communication for the respective data elements.

O.MAC                    Integrity-protected Communication
                         The TOE must be able to protect the communication by adding a MAC. This shall be implemented
                         by security attributes that enforce integrity protected communication for the respective data ele-
                         ments. Usage of the protected communication shall also support the detection of injected and
                         bogus commands within the communication session before the protected data transfer.

O.Type_Consistency       Data type consistency
                         The TOE must provide a consistent handling of the different supported data types. This com-
                         prises over- and underflow checking for values, for data file sizes and record handling.

O.Transaction            Transaction mechanism
                         The TOE must be able to provide a transaction mechanism that allows to update multiple data
                         elements either all in common or none of them.

O.No-Trace               Preventing Traceability
                         The TOE must be able to prevent that the TOE end-user can be traced. This shall be done by
                         providing an option that disables the transfer of any information that is suitable for tracing an
                         end-user by an unauthorised subject.

O.Tag-Tamper             Tag tamper detection
                         The TOE must be able to detect and permanently record tampering status on the tag tamper
                         wire.


4.2      Security Objectives for the Environment
In addition to the security objective for the operational environment as required by CC Part 1 [2], all security
objectives for the operational environment, which are defined in section 4.3 of the Protection Profile, are applied
to this Security Target and listed in table 4.3.

In addition, the following additional security objectives for the operational environment are defined in this Security
Target and listed in table 4.4.


                 Name                            Title
                 OE.Secure_Values                Generation of secure values
                 OE.Terminal_Support             Terminal support to ensure integrity, confidentiality and use of
                                                 random numbers

                   Tab. 4.4: Security Objectives of the Operational Environment defined in this Security Target


The TOE provides specific functionality that requires the TOE Manufacturer to implement measures for the unique
identification of the TOE. Therefore, OE.Secure_Values is defined to allow a TOE specific implementation (refer
also to A.Secure_Values).
OE.Secure_Values             Generation of secure values
                             The environment shall generate confidential and cryptographically strong keys for authentication
                             purpose. These values are generated outside the TOE and they are downloaded to the TOE
                             during the personalisation or usage in phase 5 to 7

The TOE provides specific functionality to verify the success of the application download process. Therefore,
OE.Terminal_Support is defined to allow triggering the verification process.
OE.Terminal_Support          Terminal support to ensure integrity, confidentiality and use of random numbers
                             The terminal shall verify information sent by the TOE in order to ensure integrity and confiden-
                             tiality of the communication. This involves checking of MAC values, verification of redundancy
                             information according to the cryptographic protocol and secure closing of the communication
                             session. Furthermore the terminal shall provide random numbers according to AIS20 (see [14])
                             or AIS31 (see [15]) for the authentication.


4.3        Security Objectives Rationale
Section 4.4 in the Protection Profile provides a rationale how the threats, organisational security policies and
assumptions are addressed by the security objectives defined in the Protection Profile. Table 4.5 summarizes this.

          Objective                           Rationale
          OE.Process-Sec-IC                   The Security Objective for the Operational Environment requires
                                              that the confidentiality and integrity of the TOE is maintained.
                                              Thus the threat is covered.


The rationale for all items defined in the Security Target is given below.

Justification related to T.Data-Modification:

          Objective                           Rationale
          O.Access-Control                    This objective requires an access control mechanism that limits
                                              the ability to modify data and code elements stored by the TOE.
          O.Type_Consistency                  This objective ensures that data types are adhered, so that TOE
                                              data can not be modified by abusing type-specific operations.
          OE.Terminal_Support                 This objective requires that the terminal must support this by
                                              checking the TOE responses.


Justification related to T.Impersonate:

          Objective                           Rationale
          O.Authentication                    This objective requires that the authentication mechanism pro-
                                              vided by the TOE shall be resistant against attack scenarios tar-
                                              geting the impersonation of authorized users.


Justification related to T.Cloning:

          Objective                           Rationale
          O.Access-Control                    This objective requires that unauthorized users can not read any
                                              information that is restricted to the authorized subjects. The cryp-
                                              tographic keys used for the authentication are stored inside the
                                              TOE and are protected by this objective. This objective states
                                              that no keys used for authentication shall ever be output.
          O.Authentication                    This objective requires that users are authenticated before they
                                              can read any information that is restricted to authorized users.


Justification related to A.Secure_Values:

          Objective                           Rationale
          OE.Secure_Values                    This objective is an immediate transformation of the assumption,
                                              therefore it covers the assumption.

         Objective                        Rationale
         OE.Terminal_Support              This objective is an immediate transformation of the assumption,
                                          therefore it covers the assumption. The TOE can only check the
                                          integrity of data received from the terminal. For data transferred
                                          to the terminal the receiver must verify the integrity of the re-
                                          ceived data. Furthermore the TOE cannot verify the entropy of
                                          the random number sent by the terminal. The terminal itself must
                                          ensure that random numbers are generaˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇted with appropriate en-
                                          tropy for the authentication. This is assumed by the related as-
                                          sumption, therefore the assumption is covered.

Justification related to P.MAC:

Justification related to P.No-Trace:

         Objective                        Rationale
         O.Access-Control                 This objective provides means to implement access control to
                                          data elements on the TOE in order to prevent tracing based on
                                          freely accessible data elements.
         O.Authentication                 This objective provides means to implement authentication on the
                                          TOE in order to prevent tracing based on freely accessible data

5        Extended Components Definitions
To define the Secure Dynamic Messaging property of the TOE, which is available in some configurations, an
additional component FDP_ETC.3 of the family FDP_ETC (export from the TOE) of the class FDP (user data
protection) is defined. This component describes the functional requirements for Secure Dynamic Messaging
capability of the TOE.


As defined in CC Part 2 [3], FDP class addresses user data protection. FDP_ETC family defines functions for
TSF-mediated exporting of user data from the TOE such that its security attributes and protection either can be
explicitly preserved or can be ignored once it has been exported. Export of user data in unauthenticated state
(FDP_ETC.3) addresses a similar concern but does not require a TOE enforcement of an access control SFP(s)
and/or information flow control SFP(s) as already defined components of the FDP_ETC family. Therefore the
extended component FDP_ETC.3 is defined.


This Security Target also re-uses the extended security functional requirements

     ‚Ä¢ FCS_RNG.1,
     ‚Ä¢ FMT_LIM.1,
     ‚Ä¢ FMT_LIM.2,
     ‚Ä¢ FAU_SAS.1,
     ‚Ä¢ and FDP_SDC.1

from Chapter 5 of the Protection Profile.


5.1      Export of user data in unauthenticated state (FDP_ETC.3)
Class and family behaviour are already defined in CC Part 2 [3].

Due to this specific property, the existing data export SFRs FDP_ETC.1 and FDP_ETC.2 did not apply well.

6        Security Requirements
This chapter defines the security requirements that shall be met by the TOE. These security requirements are
composed of the security functional requirements and the security assurance requirements that the TOE must
meet in order to achieve its security objectives.


CC allows several operations to be performed on security requirements (on the component level); refinement,
selection, assignment, and iteration are defined in Section 8.1 of CC Part 1 [2]. These operations are used in the
Protection Profile and in this Security Target, respectively.

The refinement operation is used to add details to requirements, and thus, further intensifies a requirement.
Refinements of security requirements are denoted in such a way that added words are in bold text.


The selection operation is used to select one or more options provided by the Protection Profile or CC in stating
a requirement. Selections having been made are denoted as italic text. The assignment operation is used to
assign a specific value to an unspecified parameter, such as the length of a password. Assignments having been
made are denoted as italic text.


The iteration operation is used when a component is repeated with varying operations. It is denoted by showing
brackets "‚Äô[iteration indicator]"‚Äô and the iteration indicator within the brackets.


For the sake of a better readability, the iteration operation may also be applied to some single components (being
not repeated) in order to indicate belonging of such SFRs to same functional cluster. In such a case, the iteration
operation is applied to only one single component.


Whenever an element in the Protection Profile contains an operation that is left uncompleted, the Security Target
has to complete that operation.

All assignment and selection operations of the SFR listed in the table above are performed except the operations
completed below:

For the FAU_SAS.1[HW] the Protection Profile leaves the assignment operation open for the persistent memory
type in which initialization data, pre-personalization data and/or other supplements for the Security IC Embedded
Software are stored. This assignment operation is filled in by the following statement. Note that the assignment
operations for the list of subjects and the list of audit information have already been filled in by the Protection
Profile.
FAU_SAS.1[HW]             Audit Storage

Hierarchical-To           No other components.

Dependencies              No dependencies.

FAU_SAS.1.1[HW]           The TSF shall provide the test process before TOE Delivery with the capability to store the
                          Initialisation Data and/or Pre-personalisation Data in the EEPROM.

For FCS_RNG.1.1 the Protection Profile partially fills in the assignment for the security capabilities of the RNG
by requiring a total failure test of the random source and adds an assignment operation for additional security
capabilities of the RNG. In addition, for FCS_RNG.1.2 the Protection Profile partially fills in the assignment oper-
ation for the defined quality metric for the random numbers by replacing it by a selection and assignment operation.

For the above operations the original operations defined in chapter 5 of the Protection Profile have been replaced
by the open operations in the statement of the security requirements in chapter 6 of the Protection Profile for
better readability. Note that the selection operation for the RNG type has already been filled in by the Protection
Profile.

FCS_RNG.1.1[HW]        The TSF shall provide a physical random number generator that implements:

                  (PTG.2.1) A total failure test detects a total failure of entropy source immediately when the RNG has
                             started. When a total failure is detected, no random numbers will be output.
                  (PTG.2.2) If a total failure of the entropy source occurs while the RNG is being operated, the RNG
                             prevents the output of any internal random number that depends on some raw random
                             numbers that have been generated after the total failure of the entropy source, generates
                             the internal random numbers with a post-processing algorithm of class DRG.2 as long as
                             its internal state entropy guarantees the claimed output entropy.
                  (PTG.2.3) The online test shall detect non-tolerable statistical defects of the raw random number
                             sequence (i) immediately when the RNG has started, and (ii) while the RNG is being
                             operated. The TSF must not output any random numbers before the power-up online test
                             has finished successfully or when a defect has been detected.
                  (PTG.2.4) The online test procedure shall be effective to detect non-tolerable weaknesses of the
                             random numbers soon.
                  (PTG.2.5) The online test procedure checks the quality of the raw random number sequence. It is
                             triggered applied on the following internal event: each time random numbers are drawn
                             from the RNG. The online test is suitable for detecting non-tolerable statistical defects of
                             the statistical properties of the raw random numbers within an acceptable period of time.
FCS_RNG.1.2[HW]        The TSF shall provide octets of bits that meet:

                  (PTG.2.6) Test procedure A 1 does not distinguish the internal random numbers from output se-
                             quences of an ideal RNG.
                  (PTG.2.7) The average Shannon entropy per internal random bit exceeds 0.997.

Note:                  The definition of the Security Functional Requirement FCS_RNG.1 has been taken from [1].

Note:                  The functional requirement FCS_RNG.1[HW] is a refinement of FCS_RNG.1 defined in the
                       Protection Profile according to [1].

Note:                  Application Note 20 in the Protection Profile requires that the Security Target specifies for the
                       security capabilities in FCS_RNG.1.1[HW] how the results of the total failure test of the random
                       source are provided to the TOE Software. The results of the internal test sequence are provided
                       to the TOE Software as a pass or fail criterion. The entropy of the random number is measured
                       by the Shannon-Entropy as follows: E = ‚àí 255
                                                                     P
                                                                       i=0 pi ¬∑ log2 pi where pi is the probability that the
                       byte (b7 , b6 , . . . , b0 ) is equal to i as binary number. Here the term ‚Äùbit‚Äù means measure of the
                       Shannon-Entropy. The value ‚Äù7.976‚Äù is assigned due to the requirements of ‚ÄùAIS31‚Äù, [15].
For FDP_SDC.1.1 the Protection Profile leaves the assignment operation open for the memory area in which
the TSF ensures the confidentiality of information of user data while being stored in that memory area. The
assignment operation is filled with the following statement.

The subjects are

         Subject        AppMgr                                  Application Manager
         Info           The AppMgr is the subject that owns or has access to the AppMasterKey. Note that
                        the TOE supports only a single Application.



         Subject        AppUser                                 Application User
         Info           The AppUser is the subject that owns or has access to an AppKey. Note that the
                        TOE supports multiple AppUser within the Application and the assigned rights to the
                        AppUser can be different, which allows to have more or less powerful AppUser. There
                        are 5 different AppKeys.



         Subject        OrigKeyUser                             Originality Key User
         Info           The OrigKeyUser is the subject that owns or has acces to an PICCOriginalityKeys. The
                        OrigKeyUser can authenticate with the TOE to prove the authenticity of the Security IC.

                       operation under specified conditions only. Memory encryption is used for memory protection
                       and chip shielding is added to the chip.
                       Note:        Large integer arithmetic operations are intended to be used for calculation of
                                    asymmetric cryptographic algorithms. Any asymmetric cryptographic
                                    algorithm utilizing the support for large integer arithmetic operations has to be
                                    implemented in the Security IC Embedded Software. Thus, the support for
                                    large integer arithmetic operations itself does not provide security functionality
                                    like cryptographic support. The Security IC Embedded Software implementing
                                    an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm is not included in this evaluation.
                                    Nevertheless the support for large integer arithmetic operations is part of the
                                    Security IC and therefore a security relevant component of the TOE, that must
                                    resist to the attacks mentioned in this Security Target and that must operate
                                    correctly as specified in the data sheet. The same scope of evaluation is
                                    applied to the CRC calculation.

                       The TOE consists of the IC hardware platform and Security IC Dedicated Software as
                       composed of Security IC Dedicated Test Software and Security IC Dedicated Support
                       Software. The Security IC Dedicated Test Software contains the Test-ROM Software; the
                       Security IC Dedicated Support Software contains the Boot-ROM Software and the
                       Firmware Operating System.All other software is called Security IC Embedded Software.
                       The Security IC Embedded Software is not part of the TOE.
                       The IC Dedicated Support Software consists of Boot-ROM Software controlling the boot
                       process of the hardware platform and the Firmware Operating System which can be called
                       by the Security IC Embedded Software.
                       The Firmware Operating System for the hardware platform is called the Plain Firmware
                       Operating System (FOS-Plain) and the Firmware Operating System for the MIFARE
                       Software Emulation is called the Emulation Firmware Operating System (FOS- Emu).
                       The FOS-Plain provides an interface for programming of the internal EEPROM memory,
                       which is mandatory for use by the Security IC Embedded Software when programming the
                       EEPROM memory. Furthermore FOS-Plain provides an interface for the Post Delivery
                       Configuration functionality.
                       All configurations other than P60D024/016/012P include emulation MIFARE Plus
                       MF1PLUSx0 or MIFARE DESFire EV1 in the FOS-Emu. These emulations are represented
                       by the term MIFARE Software in this document. Note that MIFARE Software is not part of
                       the TOE (see Fig 2).

                           The version of the Security IC Dedicated Software specified in Table 3, Table 4 and Table
                           5 can be identified by the Security IC Embedded Software by reading out the ROM Code
                           Number (RCN) as defined in [9], section 31.2.1. Furthermore, the version of the Firmware
                           Operating System as part of the Security IC Dedicated Support Software can be read-out
                           by Security IC Embedded Software using FVEC interface as specified in [9], section 13.4.1
                           Emulation Control Interface (FVEC0).


                 1.4.2 Evaluated configurations
                           The customer can select different logical configurations of the TOE. The configuration
                           options are structured as major and minor configuration options.


                 1.4.2.1        Major configuration options
                           The major configurations of the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF are given in Table 1. All
                           major configurations are equipped with an EEPROM of 24 kBytes and both, the ISO/IEC
                           7816 contact interface and the ISO/IEC 14443 contactless interface. Their major differences
                           are related to the availability of EEPROM space. The ‚Äò024‚Äô, ‚Äò016‚Äô and ‚Äò012‚Äô specify the
                           accessible EEPROM memory.
                           The ‚Äòy‚Äô indicates the selection of the Firmware Operating System (FOS). It is a placeholder for
                           either ‚ÄòP‚Äô, ‚ÄòM‚Äô or ‚ÄòD‚Äô:
                                  ‚Ä¢    ‚ÄòP‚Äô indicates the absence of FOS-Emu
                                  ‚Ä¢    ‚ÄòM‚Äô indicates FOS-Emu with MIFARE Plus MF1PLUSx0

                          configuration option. However, in general the minor configuration options can be chosen

                1.4.2.3     Post Delivery Configuration
                          Post Delivery Configuration (PDC) can be applied by the customer himself after the TOE
                          has been delivered to that customer. These options can be used to tailor the TOE to the
                          specific customer requirements. The Post Delivery Configuration can be changed multiple
                          times but must be set permanently by the customer before the TOE is delivered to phase 7
                          of the life cycle.
                          The Post Delivery Configuration for the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF is listed in Table
                          9.

1.4.3.2 Phase 2 ‚ÄúManufacturing‚Äù
(Step3) In a first step the TOE integrated circuit is produced containing the travel
document‚Äôs chip Dedicated Software, the parts of the travel document‚Äôs chip
Embedded Software and in case of alternative a) the ePassport application in
ROM or in EEPROM.

The IC manufacturer writes the IC Identification Data onto the chip to control the
IC as travel document material during the IC manufacturing and the delivery
process to the travel document manufacturer. The IC is securely delivered from
the IC manufacturer to the travel document manufacturer.

If necessary the IC manufacturer adds the parts of the IC Embedded Software in
the non-volatile programmable memories (for instance EEPROM).

(Step4 optional) The travel document manufacturer combines the IC with
hardware for the contact based / contactless interface in the travel document
unless the travel document consist of the chip only.

(Step5) The travel document manufacturer
  i.  adds the IC Embedded Software or part of it in the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM) if necessary and in case
      of alternative (b), loads the ePassport application into the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM),
 ii.      creates the ePassport application and
iii.      equips travel document‚Äôs chips with pre-personalization Data.

EAC PP Application Note 1: Creation of the application for this TOE implies
Applet instantiation.

For this Security Target the following name mappings to the protection profile
[EAC-PP-V2] apply:
   ÔÇ∑ IC Dedicated SW = Low level IC libraries
   ÔÇ∑ travel document‚Äôs chip Embedded Software = NXP JCOP 3 P60 operating
       system.
   ÔÇ∑ ePassport application = IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection

       instantiation of it.
   ÔÇ∑ Pre-personalization Data = Personalization Agent Key Set, Card Production
       Life Cycle (CPLC) data and buffer settings.

Both the underlying platform and IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
(SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet provide configuration and
life-cycle management functions required for TOE preparation. TOE preparation
steps are performed in manufacturing phase and consist of the following 2
activities:
    1. Platform initialisation
       2. Pre-personalisation

Platform initialisation
Platform initialisation consists of the configuration of the NXP JCOP 3 P60 in
accordance with requirements specified in the platform administrator guidance
[PLTF-PRE] by using the dedicated platform commands. Furthermore the Pre-
Personalisation Agent key set is installed and (a part of) the CPLC data is
updated. To prevent unattended tracing of the MRTD document, the NXP JCOP 3
P60 is configured such that unauthenticated access to any platform unique
idenfiable data is not possible.

                              eMRTD Configuration)

Pre-personalisation
The pre-personalisation consists of the following steps:
   a. IC (chip) Authentication and getting chip access with the pre-
      personalisation key set.
   b. [optional] In case the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
      (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet runtime code does
      not reside in ROM, it is loaded into EEPROM.
   c. Install the applet application instances depending on the desired TOE
      configuration specified in section 1.4.2, using IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with
      Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet.
   d. Set the ePassport (and if present) the Polymorphic eMRTD applet
      irreversibly in its PERSONALISATION life-cycle state by installation of the
      Personalisation Agent specific personalisation key set(s).

During step (c) the CPLC data with the IC Identifier as well as the other pre-
personalisation data is configured in the TOE. The last step (d) finalizes the TOE.
This is the moment the TOE starts to exist and is ready for delivery to the
Personalisation Agent. The guidance documentation for the Personalisation Agent
is [AGD_PRE].

The pre-personalised travel document together with the IC Iden or                           This value determines whether the AES coprocessor is

                          By applying Post Delivery Configuration the Security Rows content is updated for the
                          changed configuration options and can therefore be used for identification of the TOE after
                          applying any Post Delivery Configuration. Further details regarding Security Rows content
                          and identification of the TOE after applying Post Delivery Configuration refer to [9].

OT.Prot_Abuse-Func The security objective OT.Prot_Abuse-Func ‚ÄúProtection
  against Abuse of Functionality‚Äù is ensured by the SFRs FMT_LIM.1, FMT_LIM.2,
  FMT_LIM.1/POLY and FMT_LIM.2/POLY which prevent misuse of test
  functionality of the TOE or other features which may not be used after TOE
  Delivery.

OT.Prot_Inf_Leak The security objective OT.Prot_Inf_Leak ‚ÄúProtection against
  Information Leakage‚Äù requires the TOE to protect confidential TSF data stored
  and/or processed in the travel document‚Äôs chip against disclosure
      by measurement and analysis of the shape and amplitude of signals or the
        time between events found by measuring signals on the electromagnetic
        field, power consumption, clock, or I/O lines which is addressed by the
        SFR FPT_EMS.1,
      by forcing a malfunction of the TOE which is addressed by the SFR
        FPT_FLS.1 and FPT_TST.1, and/or
      by a physical manipulation of the TOE which is addressed by the SFR
        FPT_PHP.3.

OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper The security objective OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper ‚ÄúProtection
  against Physical Tampering‚Äù is covered by the SFR FPT_PHP.3.

OT.Prot_Malfunction The security objective OT.Prot_Malfunction ‚ÄúProtection
  against Malfunctions‚Äù is covered by (i) the SFR FPT_TST.1 which requires self-
  tests to demonstrate the correct operation and tests of authorized users to
  verify the integrity of TSF data and TSF code, and (ii) the SFRFPT_FLS.1 which
  requires a secure state in case of detected failure or operating conditions
  possibly causing a malfunction.

OT.Identification The security objective OT.Identification ‚ÄúIdentification of the
  TOE‚Äù addresses the storage of Initialisation and Pre-Personalisation Data in its
  non-volatile memory, whereby they also include the IC Identification Data
  uniquely identifying the TOE‚Äôs chip. This will be ensured by TSF according to
  SFR FAU_SAS.1. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA allows only the Manufacturer
  to write Initialisation and Pre-personalisation Data (including the
  Personalisation Agent key set). The SFR FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS requires the
  Personalisation Agent to disable access to Initialisation and Pre-personalisation
  Data in the life cycle phase ‚Äòoperational use‚Äô. The SFRs FMT_SMF.1 and
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related.

OT.AC_Pers The       security   objective  OT.AC_Pers      ‚ÄúAccess   Control   for
  Personalisation of logical travel document‚Äù addresses the access control of the
  writing the logical travel document. The justification for the SFRs FAU_SAS.1,
  FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA and FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS arises from the justification for
  OT.Identification above with respect to the Pre-personalisation Data. The write
  access to the logical travel document data are defined by the SFR
  FIA_UID.1/PACE (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM), FIA_UAU.1/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM), FDP_ACC.1/TRM and FDP_ACF.1/TRM
  in the same way: only the successfully authenticated Personalisation Agent is
  allowed to write the data of the groups EF.DG1 to EF.DG16 of the logical travel
  document only once. FMT_MTD.1/PA covers the related property of
  OT.AC_Pers (writing SOD and, in generally, personalization data). The SFR
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE lists the roles (including Personalisation Agent) and the SFR
  FMT_SMF.1 lists the TSF management functions (including Personalisation).

  The SFRs FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ (FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ for
  PACE CAM protocol) and FPT_EMS.1 restrict the access to the Personalisation
  Agent Keys, the Chip Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication
  Private key. The authentication of the terminal as Personalisation Agent shall
  be performed by TSF according to SFRs FIA_UAU.4/PACE and FIA_UAU.5/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM and FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). If the
  Personalisation Terminal wants to authenticate itself to the TOE by means of
  the Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 (after Chip Authentication v.1) with
  the Personalisation Agent Keys, the TOE will use TSF according to the
  FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the challenge), FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the
  derivation of the new session keys after Chip Authentication v.1), and
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC (for the ENC_MAC_Mode secure
  messaging), FCS_COP.1/SIG_VER (as part of the Terminal Authentication
  Protocol v.1) and FIA_UAU.6/EAC (for the re-authentication). If the
  Personalisation Terminal wants to authenticate itself to the TOE by means of
  the Authentication Mechanism with the Personalisation Agent Key, the TOE will
  use TSF according to the FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the challenge) and
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC (to verify the authentication attempt). The session keys
  are destroyed according to FCS_CKM.4 after use.

OT.Sens_Data_Conf The            security     objective      OT.Sense_Data_Conf‚Äú
  Confidentiality of sensitive biometric reference data‚Äù is enforced by the Access
  Control SFP defined in FDP_ACC.1/TRM and FDP_ACF.1/TRM allowing the data
  of EF.DG3 and EF.DG4 only to be read by successfully authenticated Extended
  Inspection System being authorized by a valid certificate according
  FCS_COP.1/SIG_VER. The SFRs FIA_UID.1/PACE and FIA_UAU.1/PACE
  (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM and FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) require the
  identification and authentication of the inspection systems. The SFR
  FIA_UAU.5/PACE requires the successful Chip Authentication (CA) v.1 before
  any     authentication    attempt   as    Extended     Inspection  System    (or
  FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). During the protected communication
  following the CA v.1 the reuse of authentication data is prevented by
  FIA_UAU.4/PACE (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). The SFR
  FIA_UAU.6/EAC and FDP_UCT.1/TRM requires the confidentiality protection of
  the transmitted data after Chip Authentication v.1 by means of secure
  messaging implemented by the cryptographic functions according to
  FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the terminal authentication challenge),
  FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the generation of shared secret and for the derivation of
  the new session keys), and FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC for
  the ENC_MAC_Mode secure messaging. The session keys are destroyed
  according to FCS_CKM.4 after use. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/CAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ requires that the Chip Authentication Key cannot be
  written unauthorized or read afterwards. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/AAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ requires that the Active Authentication Key cannot be
  written       unauthorized       or      read      afterwards.      The     SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_WRITE and FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ
  requires that the modular invert of the CA key cannot be written unauthorized
  or read afterwards. To allow a verification of the certificate chain as in
  FMT_MTD.3 the CVCA‚Äôs public key and certificate as well as the current date

OT.Chip_Auth_Proof The security objective OT.Chip_Auth_Proof ‚ÄúProof of
  travel document‚Äôs chip authenticity‚Äù is ensured by the Chip Authentication
  Protocolv.1 provided by FIA_API.1/CA and by Active Authentication provided
  by FIA_API.1/AA proving the identity of the TOE. The Chip Authentication
  Protocolv.1 defined by FCS_CKM.1/CA is performed using a TOE internally
  stored confidential private key as required by FMT_MTD.1/CAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ. The Chip Authentication Protocolv.1 [TR-03110-1]
  requires additional TSF according to FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the derivation of the
  session keys), FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC (for the
  ENC_MAC_Mode        secure    messaging).    The   SFRs     FMT_SMF.1     and
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related. The Active
  Authentication defined by FCS_COP.1/SIG_GEN for the generation of the RSA
  Signature is performed using a TOE internally stored confidential private key
  as required by FMT_MTD.1/AAPK and FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ. According to
  FDP_ACF.1, only the successfully authenticated Inspection Systems are
  allowed to request active authentication (FDP_ACF.1.2, rule 2).

6.3.3.1.1 Rationale for the exclusion of Dependencies


The dependency FMT_MSA.3 of FDP_ACF.1/TRM is discarded. The access
  control TSF according to FDP_ACF.1/TRM uses security attributes which are
  defined during the personalisation and are fixed over the whole life time of the
  TOE. No management of these security attribute (i.e. SFR FMT_MSA.1 and
  FMT_MSA.3) is necessary here.

6.3.4 Rationale for the Security Assurance Requirements
The EAL5 was chosen to permits a developer to gain maximum assurance from
positive security engineering based upon rigorous commercial development
practices supported by moderate application of specialist security engineering
techniques. Such a TOE will probably be designed and developed with the intent
of achieving EAL5 assurance. It is likely that the additional costs attributable to
the EAL5 requirements, relative to rigorous development without the application
of specialised techniques, will not be large.

7 TOE Summary Specification

7.1 TOE Summary Specification
This section provides a description of the security functions and assurance
measures of the TOE that meet the TOE security requirements.

The TOE provides security features (SF) which can be associated to following
groups:
  Identification and Authentication mechanisms
  Cryptographic functions support
  Access control /Storage and protection of logical travel document data
  Secure messaging
  Security and Life-cycle management
Moreover, the TOE will protect itself against interference, logical tampering and
bypass. The security functionality of the TOE respectively the IDeal Pass v2.3-n
JC with Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet
will be externally available to the user by APDU commands according to the
access conditions specified by the according policies considering the life cycle
state, user role and security state.

7.1.1 SF.IA Identification and Authentication
The different authentication mechanisms are supported by APDU commands and
parameters using the cryptographic functions provided by the platform. The
authentication mechanisms are enforced by protocols and APDU methods as
specified in the functional specification.

Note that Symmetric Basic Access Control (BAC) Authentication Mechanism is
supported by the TOE but not covered by this Security Target.

The TOE supports the following authentication mechanisms:
     ÔÇ∑   SF.IA.1: Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
     ÔÇ∑   SF.IA.2: EAC Chip Authentication v. 1
     ÔÇ∑   SF.IA.3: EAC Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1
     ÔÇ∑   SF.IA.4: Authentication of the Personalization Agent with a
         personalisation key set based on a symmetric authentication
         mechanism
     ÔÇ∑   SF.IA.5: ICAO Active Authentication
     ÔÇ∑   SF.IA.6: Optionally PACE with additional Chip Authentication Mapping
         (PACE CAM)
     ÔÇ∑   SF.IA.7: Polymorphic Authentication (PMA)
     ÔÇ∑   SF.IA.8: Polymorphic eMRTD Document Holder Verification

                       eMRTD Configuration)

7.1.2 SF.CF Cryptographic functions support
Cryptographic function support is provided by the underlying NXP JCOP 3 P60,
i.e. the TOE relies on the underlying platform for performing its required
cryptographic operations.

SF.CF Cryptographic functions include:
     ÔÇ∑   SF.CF.1: 3DES and AES cipher operations for secure messaging
     ÔÇ∑   SF.CF.2: Digest calculations (SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and
         SHA-512)
     ÔÇ∑   SF.CF.3: Signature generation (ECDSA, RSA)
     ÔÇ∑   SF.CF.4: Signature verification (ECDSA, RSA)
     ÔÇ∑   SF.CF.5: Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement (ECDH and DH)
     ÔÇ∑   SF.CF.6: Key Generation (PACE ECDH/DH ephemeral keys and secure
         messaging MAC and ENC session keys)
     ÔÇ∑   SF.CF.7: Key and secret authentication data Destruction
     ÔÇ∑   SF.CF.8: True Random Number generation
     ÔÇ∑   SF.CF.9: Randomization of PI/PP/CPI data as part of the Polymorphic
         Authentication protocol (PMA)




7.1.3 SF.ILTB Protection against interference, logical tampering
and bypass

SF.ILTB.1
  Protection against interference, logical tampering and bypass
  Security domains are supported by the Java Card platform used by the TOE
  underlying NXP JCOP 3 P60. The NXP JCOP 3 P60 provides protection against
  physical attack and performs self-tests as described in [PLTF-ST].
  The platform protects the TOE against malfunctions that are caused by

  hardware resets and operation outside the specified norms.
  The IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic
  eMRTD Configuration) Applet uses transient memory where a hardware reset
  always reverts the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
  (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet into an unauthenticated
  state.

7.1.4 SF.AC Access control / Storage and protection of logical
travel document data

SF.AC.1
  Access control / Storage and protection of logical travel document
  data
  The TOE provided access control, storage and protection of logical travel
  document data including access control to MRTD data. The TOE implements
  the subjects, objects, security attributes and rules according to the security
  attribute based access control. Access control is enforced by the APDU
  methods as specified in the interface defined in the functional specification.

7.1.5 SF.SM Secure Messaging

SF.SM.1
  Secure Messaging
  Secure messaging MAC and ENC operations are performed by the TOE‚Äôs
  platform.
  Secure messaging in ENC_MAC mode is established during PACE or re-
  established during Chip Authentication v1 and is based on SF.CF.1, 5, 6 and 8.

SF.SM.2
  Secure Messaging ‚Äì Re-authentication
  The Retail MAC for 3DES and CMAC for AES are part of every APDU
  command/response when secure messaging is active after a successful PACE
  or Chip Authentication has been accomplished. Re-authentication after reset of
  the SM protocol is assured by accepting only valid (mandatory) MAC or CMAC
  cryptograms.

7.1.6 SF.LCM Security and life cycle management

SF.LCM.1
  Management of phases and roles
  For the TOE the following life-cycle phases have been identified:
      1. Manufacturing phase
      2. Personalisation phase
      3. Operational phase
      4. Termination phase
  Each life-cycle phase (or state) has its typical user acting as role holder.

  All role holders in Manufacturing, Pre-Personalisation and Personalisation
  phases are identified by cryptographic authentication keys. In Operational
  phase the PACE password is required to authenticate the Basic or Extended
  Inspection System in order to get access to the non-sensitive ICAO LDS
  datagroups.
  The IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic
  eMRTD Configuration) Applet maintains the internal life-cycle state the
  moment that the applet is installed. This state, together with the access
  control mechanisms force the Terminal into a specific role, for the pre-
  personalisation and subsequent, personalisation and operational phases. The
  phases (and corresponding life-cycle states) are controlled by APDU
  commands.



SF.LCM.2
  Life Cycle states of the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
  (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet
  The TOE supports the following life-cycle states:
      1. Not instantiated (applet resides in ROM or in EEPROM)
      2. PRE-PERSONALISATION state
      3. PERSONALISATION state
      4. OPERATIONAL state
      5. TERMINATED state (irreversibly)
  Each life-cycle phase (or state) has its typical user acting as role holder.

A.Polymorphic_Auth
  It assumed that:
      o All authentication infrastructure keys used by the central Key
          Management       Authority     for   the    polymorphic    authentication
          infrastructure (generation and transformation of PP, PI and CPI) are
          generated, handled and stored securely.
      o The PP/PI/CPI are generated securely by the central Key Management
          Authority of the polymorphic authentication infrastructure and stored
          securely in the eMRTD polymorphic chip during the personalization
          phase.
      o The TOE communicates only with Trustworthy Authentication
          Service/Terminal during the Polymorphic Authentication.
      o The randomised PP, PI and CPI are securely received by Polymorphic
          Authentication Service/Terminal. The randomised PP, PI and CPI are
          transformed (‚Äúre-keyed‚Äù) by the central Key Management Authority
          (i.e. ElGamal re-encryption of the randomized PP, PI and/or CPI using
          the public key of Servicez Provider, who has is authorized to read the
          plain value of identifying user attributes included in the PP, PI or CPI).
          Identification by the identifying user attributes contained inside the PP,
          PI and CPI takes place at the Service Provider.
  Application Note:
  This Assumption has been added to this ST for the polymorphic authentication
  infrastructure. This addition does not conflict with the strict conformance to
  PACE PP [PACE-PP] and EACv1 PP [EAC-PP-V2].

A.Auth_PKI_Polymorphic
  PKI for Polymorphic eMRTD It is assumed that:
     o The issuing States or Organisations establish a dedicated CVCA, DVCA
        and IS PKI for the polymorphic eMRTD infrastructure.
     o The Country Verifying Certification Authorities, the Document Verifier
        and Extended Inspection Systems hold authentication key pairs and
        certificates for their public keys encoding the access control rights for
        access to the PP, PI and (optional) CPI polymorphic user data. The

         keys of their Country Verifying Certification Authority to their
         Polymorphic eMRTD document's chip.
      o The issuing State or Organisation establishs the necessary public key
         infrastructure in order to limit the access to Polymorphic data of
         Polymorphic eMRTD document holders to authorized Organisations. The
         Country Verifying Certification Authority of the issuing State or
         Organisation generates card verifiable Document Verifier Certificates
         for the authorized Document Verifier only.
      o The issuing State or Organisation establishs the necessary public key
         infrastructure in order to (i) generate the Polymorphic eMRTD
         document's Chip Authentication Key Pair, (ii) sign and store the Chip
         Authentication Public Key in the Chip Authentication Public Key data
         and (iii) support Polymorphic Authentication Terminals/Services to
         verify the authenticity of the Polymorphic eMRTD document's chip
         according to [TR-03110] used for genuine Polymorphic eMRTD
         document by certification of the Chip Authentication Public Key by
         means of the Document Security Object.
      o The Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer establishes a public key
         infrastructure for the card verifiable certificates used for Terminal
         Authentication. For this aim, the Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer
         shall run a Country Verifying Certification Authority. The PKI shall fulfill
         the requirements and rules of the corresponding certificate policy. The
         Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer shall make the CVCA certificate
         available to the personalization agent or the manufacturer.
      o The polymorphic eMRTD document Issuer issues the polymorphic
         eMRTD document and approves it using the terminals and
         authentication services complying with all applicable laws and
         regulations.
  Application Note:
  This Assumption is an extension of the Assumption 'A.Auth_PKI' defined in
  [EAC-PP-V2]. For the EAC functionality of the TOE the assumption is necessary
  because it covers the pre-requisite for performing the Terminal Authentication
  Protocol Version 1.

A.Insp_Sys_Polymorphic

Polymorphic Inspection Systems and authentication services
     o Polymorphic    Inspection     Systems   (Polymorphic     Authentication
       Terminals/Services) ensure the confidentiality, Privacy, Authenticity
       and integrity of the polymorphic data read from the polymorphic
       eMRTD document (e.g. PACE PIN/PUK, integrity of PKI certificates,
       randomized PI, PP and optional CPI data, etc.), where it is necessary
       for a secure operation of the TOE.
     o Polymorphic Inspection Systems will prevent eavesdropping to their
       communication with the TOE before secure messaging is successfully
       established based on the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1.

   o   Polymorphic Inspection Systems examine the polymorphic eMRTD
       document presented by the polymorphic eMRTD document holder to
       verify its authenticity by means of the physical security measures and
       to detect any manipulation of the physical part of the polymorphic
       eMRTD document.
    o Polymorphic Inspection Systems include the Country Signing CA Public
       Key and implement the respective terminal part of the protocols
       required to execute PACE with PIN, Passive Authentication (PA), CAv1,
       TAv1 authentication according to [TR-03110-2] and Polymorphic
       Authentication (PMA). They are assumed to securely store static IS
       private keys and generate secure temporary session keys and nonces.
    o The Document Verifier authorizes Polymorphic Inspection Systems by
       creation of Inspection System Certificates for access to polymorphic
       user data stored the polymorphic eMRTD document. An Polymorphic
       Inspection Systems authenticates itselve to the polymorphic eMRTD
       document's chip for getting access to the polymorphic data with its
       private Terminal Authentication key and corresponding Inspection
       System Certificate.
Application Note:
This Assumption is an extension of the Assumption 'A.Insp_Sys' defined in

4 Security Objectives

This chapter describes the security objectives for the TOE and the security
objectives for the TOE environment. The security objectives for the TOE
environment are separated into security objectives for the development and
production environment and security objectives for the operational environment.


4.1 Security Objectives for the TOE
This section describes the security objectives for the TOE addressing the aspects
of identified threats to be countered by the TOE and organizational security
policies to be met by the TOE.

4.1.1 Security Objectives listed in PP PACE

OT.Data_Integrity
  Integrity of Data
  The TOE must ensure integrity of the User Data and the TSF-data stored on it
  by protecting these data against unauthorised modification (physical
  manipulation and unauthorised modifying). The TOE must ensure integrity of

  on it by enabling verification of their authenticity at the terminal-side. The TOE
  must ensure authenticity of the User Data and the TSF-data during their
  exchange between the TOE and the terminal connected (and represented by
  PACE authenticated BIS-PACE)after the PACE Authentication. It shall happen
  by enabling such a verification at the terminal-side (at receiving by the
  terminal) and by an active verification by the TOE itself (at receiving by the
  TOE).

OT.Data_Confidentiality
  Confidentiality of Data
  The TOE must ensure confidentiality of the User Data and the TSF-data by
  granting read access only to the PACE authenticated BIS-PACE connected. The
  TOE must ensure confidentiality of the User Data and the TSF-data during

                       eMRTD Configuration)

OT.Tracing
  Tracing travel document
  The TOE must prevent gathering TOE tracing data by means of unambiguous
  identifying the travel document remotely through establishing or listening to a
  communication via the contactless/contact interface of the TOE without
  knowledge of the correct values of shared passwords (PACE passwords) in
  advance.

OT.Prot_Abuse-Func
  Protection against Abuse of Functionality
  The TOE must prevent that functions of the TOE, which may not be used in
  TOE operational phase, can be abused in order (i) to manipulate or to disclose
  the User Data stored in the TOE, (ii) to manipulate or to disclose the TSF-data
  stored in the TOE, (iii) to manipulate (bypass, deactivate or modify) soft-
  coded security functionality of the TOE.

OT.Prot_Inf_Leak
  Potection against Information Leakage The TOE must provide protection
  against disclosure of confidential User Data or/and TSF-data stored and/or
  processed by the travel document
      by measurement and analysis of the shape and amplitude of signals or the
        time between events found by measuring signals on the electromagnetic
        field, power consumption, clock, or I/O lines,
      by forcing a malfunction of the TOE and/or
      by a physical manipulation of the TOE.

OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper
  Protection against Physical Tampering
  The TOE must provide protection the confidentiality and integrity of the User
  Data, the TSF Data, and the MRTD‚Äôs chip Embedded Software. This includes
  protection against attacks with high attack potential by means of
      measuring through galvanic contacts which is direct physical probing on
        the chips surface except on pads being bonded (using standard tools for
        measuring voltage and current) or
      measuring not using galvanic contacts but other types of physical
        interaction between charges (using tools used in solid-state physics
        research and IC failure analysis)
      manipulation of the hardware and its security features, as well as
      controlled manipulation of memory contents (User Data, TSF Data) with a
        prior
      reverse-engineering to understand the design and its properties and
        functions.

                        eMRTD Configuration)

OT.Prot_Malfunction
  Protection against Malfunctions
  The TOE must ensure its correct operation. The TOE must prevent its
  operation outside the normal operating conditions where reliability and secure
  operation have not been proven or tested. This is to prevent functional errors
  in the TOE. The environmental conditions may include external energy
  (especially electromagnetic) fields, voltage (on any contacts), clock frequency
  or temperature.

OT.Identification
  Identification and Authentication of the TOE
  The TOE must provide means to store Initialisation and Pre-Personalisation
  Data in its non-volatile memory. The Initialisation Data must provide a unique
  identification of the IC during the manufacturing and the card issuing life cycle
  phases of the travel document. The storage of the Pre-Personalisation data
  includes writing of the Personalisation Agent Key(s).

OT.AC_Pers
  Access Control for Personalisation of logical MRTD
  The TOE must ensure that the logical travel document data in EF.DG1 to
  EF.DG16, the Document Security Object according to LDS [ICAO-9303] and
  the TSF data can be written by authorized Personalisation Agents only. The
  logical travel document data in EF.DG1 to EF.DG16 and the TSF data may be
  written only during and cannot be changed after personalisation of the
  document.

4.1.2 Additional Security Objectives from PP EAC

OT.Sens_Data_Conf
  Confidentiality of sensitive biometric reference data
  The TOE must ensure the confidentiality of the sensitive biometric reference
  data (EF.DG3 and EF.DG4) by granting read access only to authorized
  Extended Inspection Systems. The authorization of the inspection system is
  drawn from the Inspection System Certificate used for the successful
  authentication and shall be a non-strict subset of the authorization defined in
  the Document Verifier Certificate in the certificate chain to the Country Verifier
  Certification Authority of the issuing State or Organisation. The TOE must
  ensure the confidentiality of the logical travel document data during their
  transmission to the Extended Inspection System. The confidentiality of the
  sensitive biometric reference data shall be protected against attacks with high
  attack potential.

OT.Polymorphic_Data_Confidentiality
  Confidentiality of eMRTD polymorphic data
  The TOE must ensure the confidentiality of the sensitive static polymorphic
  eMRTD PI, PP and CPI user data stored on the TOE during personalisation by
  denying all read access to everybody. Only read access to the randomized
  representation of the polymorphic user data is possible and only granted to
  authorized and authenticated Polymorphic Authentication Terminals/Services.
  The TOE must ensure the confidentiality of the eMRTD polymorphic User Data
  (randomized PI, PP and optional CPI) during their exchange between the TOE
  and the Polymorphic Authentication terminal/Service connected after
  successfully executing the sequence of PACE with PIN, PA, CAv1, TAv1 and
  PMA authentication.
  Application Note:
  This OT is an extension of the OTs ‚ÄòOT.Sens_Data_Conf‚Äô and

  Application Note:
  This OT is an extension of the OT ‚ÄòOT.Data_Authenticity‚Äô defined in [PACE-PP]
  to ensure the authenticity of the polymorphic eMRTD PI/PP/CPI data. This
  extension does not conflict with the strict conformance to PACE and EACv1
  PPs.

OT.Polymorphic_Data_Privacy
  Privacy of eMRTD polymorphic user data
  The TOE guarantees the privacy of the PI, PP and optional CPI user data by
  randomising the PI, PP and optional CPI user data during the polymorphic
  authentication (PMA), prior to returning it to the authorised Polymorphic
  Authentication Terminal/Service. This prevents the Authenication Service from
  being able to harvest any user or card unique identifiable data.
  Application Note:
  This OT has been added to this ST to ensure and maintain the privacy of the
  polymorphic     PI, PP and optional CPI user data during the Polymorphic
  Authentication (sequence of PACE with PIN, CAv1, TAv1 and PMA). This
  addition does not conflict with the strict conformance to PACE and EACv1 PPs.

  PIN and PUK are blocking PACE passwords. Therefore the number of incorrect
  authentication attempts on the PACE PIN and PUK passwords shall be
  controlled by the TOE to prevent a denial of service.

  The TOE shall implement the suspend and resume mechanisms specified in
  [TR-3110-2] for blocking PACE passwords, PIN and (if present) PUK.



4.2 Security Objectives for the Operational Environment


4.2.1 Issuing State or Organisation
The Issuing State or Organization will implement the following security objectives
of the TOE environment.


OE.Legislative_Compliance
  Issuing of the travel document
  The travel document Issuer must issue the travel document and approve it
  using the terminals complying with all applicable laws and regulations.

OE.Auth_Key_Travel_Document
  Travel document Authentication Key
  The issuing State or Organisation has to establish the necessary public key
  infrastructure in order to (i) generate the travel document‚Äôs Chip
  Authentication Key Pair, (ii) sign and store the Chip Authentication Public Key
  in the Chip Authentication Public Key data in EF.DG14 and (iii) support
  inspection systems of receiving States or Organisations to verify the
  authenticity of the travel document‚Äôs chip used for genuine travel document by
  certification of the Chip Authentication Public Key by means of the Document
  Security Object.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to counter the Threat
  T.Counterfeit as it specifies the pre-requisite for the Chip Authentication
  Protocol Version 1 which is one of the additional features of the TOE described
  only in [EAC-PP-V2] and not in [PACE-PP].

  infra-structure in order to (i) generate the MRTD‚Äôs Active Authentication Key
  Pair, (ii) sign and store the Active Authentication Public Key in the Active
  Authentication Public Key data in EF.DG15 (if generated) and (iii) support
  inspection systems of receiving States or organizations to verify the
  authenticity of the MRTD‚Äôs chip used for genuine MRTD by certification of the
  Active Authentication Public Key by means of the Document Security Object.



OE.Authoriz_Sens_Data
  Authorization for Use of Sensitive Biometric Reference Data
  The issuing State or Organisation has to establish the necessary public key
  infrastructure in order to limit the access to sensitive biometric reference data
  of travel document holders to authorized receiving States or Organisations.
  The Country Verifying Certification Authority of the issuing State or
  Organisation generates card verifiable Document Verifier Certificates for the
  authorized Document Verifier only.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Read_Sensitive_Data, the Organisational Security Policy P.Sensitive_Data
  and the Assumption A.Auth_PKI as it specifies the pre-requisite for the
  Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 as it concerns the need of an PKI for this
  protocol and the responsibilities of its root instance. The Terminal
  Authentication Protocol v.1 is one of the additional features of the TOE
  described only in [EAC-PP-V2] and not in [PACE-PP].

4.2.2 Travel document Issuer and CSCA: travel document PKI
(issuing) branch
The travel document Issuer and the related CSCA will implement the following
security objectives for the TOE environment:


OE.Passive_Auth_Sign
  Authentication of travel document by Signature.
  The travel document Issuer has to establish the necessary public key
  infrastructure as follows: the CSCA acting on behalf and according to the

A.      Certification

1.      Preliminary Remarks
Under the BSIG1 Act, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) has the task of
issuing certificates for information technology products.
Certification of a product is carried out on the instigation of the vendor or a distributor,
hereinafter called the sponsor.
A part of the procedure is the technical examination (evaluation) of the product according
to the security criteria published by the BSI or generally recognised security criteria.
The evaluation is normally carried out by an evaluation facility recognised by the BSI or by
BSI itself.
The result of the certification procedure is the present Certification Report. This report
contains among others the certificate (summarised assessment) and the detailed
Certification Results.
The Certification Results contain the technical description of the security functionality of
the certified product, the details of the evaluation (strength and weaknesses) and
instructions for the user.

2.      Specifications of the Certification Procedure
The certification body conducts the procedure according to the criteria laid down in the
following:

3.      Recognition Agreements
In order to avoid multiple certification of the same product in different countries a mutual
recognition of IT security certificates - as far as such certificates are based on ITSEC or
CC - under certain conditions was agreed.

3.1.    European Recognition of CC ‚Äì Certificates (SOGIS-MRA)
The SOGIS-Mutual Recognition Agreement (SOGIS-MRA) Version 3 became effective in
April 2010. It defines the recognition of certificates for IT-Products at a basic recognition
level and, in addition, at higher recognition levels for IT-Products related to certain SOGIS
Technical Domains only.
The basic recognition level includes Common Criteria (CC) Evaluation Assurance Levels
EAL 1 to EAL 4. For "Smartcards and similar devices" a SOGIS Technical Domain is in
place. For "HW Devices with Security Boxes" a SOGIS Technical Domains is in place, too.
In addition, certificates issued for Protection Profiles based on Common Criteria are part of
the recognition agreement.
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes, details on
recognition, and the history of the agreement can be seen on the website at
https://www.sogisportal.eu.
The SOGIS-MRA logo printed on the certificate indicates that it is recognised under the
terms of this agreement by the related bodies of the signatory nations. A disclaimer
beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of recognition.
This certificate is recognized under SOGIS-MRA for all assurance components selected.

3.2.    International Recognition of CC ‚Äì Certificates (CCRA)
The international arrangement on the mutual recognition of certificates based on the CC
(Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement, CCRA-2014) has been ratified on 08
September 2014. It covers CC certificates based on collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP)
(exact use), CC certificates based on assurance components up to and including EAL 2 or
the assurance family Flaw Remediation (ALC_FLR) and CC certificates for Protection
Profiles and for collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP).
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes can be seen on
the website: https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org.
The Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement logo printed on the certificate indicates
that this certification is recognised under the terms of this agreement by the related bodies
of the signatory nations. A disclaimer beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of
recognition.
This certificate is recognized according to the rules of CCRA-2014, i. e. up to and including
CC part 3 EAL 2+ ALC_FLR components.

4.      Performance of Evaluation and Certification
The certification body monitors each individual evaluation to ensure a uni»orm procedure, a
uniform interpretation of the criteria and uniform ratings.
The product NXP Secure Smart Card Controller N7021 VA including IC Dedicated
Software has undergone the certification procedure at BSI. This is a re-certification based
on BSI-DSZ-CC-0977-2017. Specific results from the evaluation process BSI-DSZ-CC-
0977-2017 were re-used.
The evaluation of the product NXP Secure Smart Card Controller N7021 VA including IC
Dedicated Software was conducted by T√úV Informationstechnik GmbH. The evaluation
was completed on 18 July 2019. T√úV Informationstechnik GmbH is an evaluation facility
(ITSEF)5 recognised by the certification body of BSI.
For this certification procedure the sponsor and applicant is: NXP Semiconductors
Germany GmbH.
The product was developed by: NXP Semiconductors Germany GmbH.
The certification is concluded with the comparability check and the production of this
Certification Report. This work was completed by the BSI.

5.      Validity of the Certification Result
This Certification Report applies only to the version of the product as indicated. The
confirmed assurance package is valid on the condition that
‚óè   all stipulations regarding generation, configuration and operation, as given in the
    following report, are observed,
‚óè   the product is operated in the environment described, as specified in the following report
    and in the Security Target.
For the meaning of the assurance components and assurance levels please refer to CC
itself. Detailed references are listed in part C of this report.
The Certificate issued confirms the assurance of the product claimed in the Security Target
at the date of certification. As attack methods evolve over time, the resistance of the
certified version of the product against new attack methods needs to be re-assessed.
Therefore, the sponsor should apply for the certified product being monitored within the
assurance continuity program of the BSI Certification Scheme (e.g. by a re-assessment or
re-certification). Specifically, if results of the certification are used in subsequent evaluation
and certification procedures, in a system integration process or if a user's risk
management needs regularly updated results, it is recommended to perform a re-
assessment on a regular e.g. annual basis.
In order to avoid an indefinite usage of the certificate when evolved attack methods would
require a re-assessment of the products resistance to state of the art attack methods, the
maximum validity of the certificate has been limited. The certificate issued on 31 July 2019
is valid until 31 July 2024. Validity can be re-newed by re-certification.
The owner of the certificate is obliged:
     1. when advertising the certificate or the fact of the product's certification, to refer to
        the Certification Report as well as to provide the Certification Report, the Security

        Target and user guidance documentation mentioned herein to any customer of the
        product for the application and usage of the certified product,
     2. to inform the Certification Body at BSI immediately about vulnerabilities of the
        product that have been identified by the developer or any third party after issuance
        of the certificate,
     3. to inform the Certification Body at BSI immediately in the case that security relevant
        changes in the evaluated life cycle, e.g. related to development and production sites
        or processes, occur, or the confidentiality of documentation and information related
        to the Target of Evaluation (TOE) or resulting from the evaluation and certification
        procedure where the certification of the product has assumed this confidentiality
        being maintained, is not given any longer. In particular, prior to the dissemination of
        confidential documentation and information related to the TOE or resulting from the
        evaluation and certification procedure that do not belong to the deliverables
        according to the Certification Report part B, or for those where no dissemination
        rules have been agreed on, to third parties, the Certification Body at BSI has to be
        informed.
In case of changes to the certified version of the product, the validity can be extended to
the new versions and releases, provided the sponsor applies for assurance continuity (i.e.
re-certification or maintenance) of the modified product, in accordance with the procedural
requirements, and the evaluation does not reveal any security deficiencies.

1.     Executive Summary
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is the IC hardware platform ‚ÄúNXP Secure Smart Card
Controller N7021 VA including IC Dedicated Software‚Äù and documentation describing
instruction set and usage of the TOE. The TOE does not include a customer-specific
Security IC Embedded Software.
The IC Dedicated Software comprises IC Dedicated Test Software for test purposes and
IC Dedicated Support Software. The IC Dedicated Support Software consists of the Boot
Software, which controls the boot process of the hardware platform. Furthermore, it
provides a Firmware Interface and optionally a Library Interface, simplifying access to the
hardware for the Security IC Embedded Software. A System Mode OS is available
(optional), offering ready-to-use resource and access management for customer
applications that do not want to be exposed to the more low-level features of the TOE. The
Flashloader OS (optional) supports download of code and data to Flash by the Composite
Product Manufacturer before Operational Usage (e.g. during development). The
Symmetric Crypto Library (optional) provides simplified access to frequently used
symmetric cryptography algorithms.
The N7021 VA supports two logical cards (Card A and Card B). Both logical cards are
divided into a User Mode and a System Mode. The logical location of the Security IC
Embedded Software depends on the usage of the IC hardware platform. Card A is
reserved for Security IC Embedded Software developed by NXP. Card B is available for
Security IC Embedded Software developed by the customer. If a customer did not order
any NXP developed Security IC Embedded Software product, then User Mode Card A is
not present.
The Security Target [6] is the basis for this certification. It is based on the certified
Protection Profile Security IC Platform Protection Profile with Augmentation Packages
Version 1.0, 13 January 2014, BSI-CC-PP-0084-2014 [8].
The TOE Security Assurance Requirements (SAR) are based entirely on the assurance
components defined in Part 3 of the Common Criteria (see part C or [1], Part 3 for details).
The TOE meets the assurance requirements of the Evaluation Assurance Level EAL 6
augmented by ASE_TSS.2, ALC_FLR.1.
The TOE Security Functional Requirements (SFR) relevant for the TOE are outlined in the
Security Target [6] and [9], chapter 6. They are selected from Common Criteria Part 2 and
some of them are newly defined. Thus the TOE is CC Part 2 extended.
The TOE Security Functional Requirements are implemented by the following TOE

                                      Table 2: Deliverables of the TOE
The requirements for the delivery of the TOE are described in chapter 31 of the ‚ÄúProduct
Data Sheet‚Äù [11]. For each delivery form of the hardware platform NXP offers two ways of
delivery of the TOE:
1. The customer collects the product himself at the NXP site.
2. The product is sent to the customer by NXP with special protective measures.
The TOE documentation and related software (items are marked in Table 5) are delivered
in electronic form by the document control centre of NXP.
The hardware version can be identified by a coded nameplate as described in [13]
chapters 2.9.2 and 3.2.



                                                                                                       14 / 32
BSI-DSZ-CC-0977-V2-2019                                                         Certification Report




The TOE further provides the FabKey which can be configured by the customer to hold
128 bytes for batch, wafer or die individual data and can be read out by the configuration
interface (see GetFabKey API in [17], chapter 5 and [23], chapter 5.2). The process of
FabKey submission is described in [11], chapter 26.
Only the configurations defined in [17], chapter 5.6.3.2, Tab. 5.40 and in [23], chapter
5.8.3.2, Tab. 5.57 are evaluated options.
The ST references the version of the Crypto Library. This version number is also noted in
the [27], chapter 2 thus the TOE components listed in the guidance are traceable to the
reference given in the Security Target [6] and [9]. Furthermore, [27], chapter 2 describes
the integrity and confidentiality check of files associated with the crypto library. It lists SHA-
256 values for each library file for identification purposes. In addition to identifying the
delivered components, the library identifies itself via its ‚ÄúGetVersion‚Äù command.

3.       Security Policy
The security policy enforced is defined by the selected set of Security Functional
Requirements and implemented by the TOE. It covers the following issues:
The Security Policy of the TOE is to provide basic security functionalities to be used by the
smart card operating system and the smart card application thus providing an overall
smart card system security. Therefore, the TOE will implement the symmetric
cryptographic block cipher algorithm to ensure the confidentiality of plain text data by
encryption and to support secure authentication protocols and it will provide a True
Random Number Generator (TRNG) and Deterministic Random Number Generator
(DRNG).
As the TOE is a hardware security platform, the security policy of the TOE is also to
provide protection against leakage of information (e.g. to ensure the confidentiality of
cryptographic keys during cryptographic functions performed by the TOE), against physical
probing, against malfunctions, against physical manipulations and against abuse of
functionality. Hence the TOE shall
     ‚Ä¢   maintain the integrity and the confidentiality of data stored in the memory of the
         TOE and
     ‚Ä¢   maintain the integrity, the correct operation and the confidentiality of security
         functionalities (security mechanisms and associated functions) provided by the
         TOE.
Specific details concerning the above mentioned security policies can be found in chapter
7 of the Security Target [6] and [9].

4.       Assumptions and Clarification of Scope
The Assumptions defined in the Security Target and some aspects of Threats and
Organisational Security Policies are not covered by the TOE itself. These aspects lead to
specific security objectives to be fulfilled by the TOE Environment. The following topics are
of relevance: OE.Process-Sec-IC, OE.Lim_Block_Loader, OE.Loader_Usage, OE.Check-
Init. Details can be found in the Security Target [6] and [9], chapter 4.3.




                                                                                             15 / 32

5.       Architectural Information
The IC hardware is a microcontroller incorporating a central processing unit (CPU),
memories accessible via a Memory Management Unit (MMU), cryptographic
coprocessors, other security components and several electrical communication interfaces.
The central processing unit supports a 32-/16-bit instruction set optimized for smart card
applications. The first and in some cases the second byte of an instruction are used for
operation encoding. On-chip memories are ROM, RAM and Flash. The Flash can be used
as data or program memory. It consists of highly reliable memory cells, which are designed
to provide data integrity. Flash is optimized for applications that require reliable non-volatile
data storage for data and program code. Dedicated security functionality protects the
contents of all memories.
The IC Dedicated Software comprises IC Dedicated Test Software for test purposes and
IC Dedicated Support Software. The IC Dedicated Support Software consists of the Boot
Software, which controls the boot process of the hardware platform. Furthermore, it
provides a Firmware Interface and optionally a Library Interface, simplifying access to the
hardware for the Security IC Embedded Software. A System Mode OS is available
(optional), offering ready-to-use resource and access management for customer
applications that do not want to be exposed to the more low-level features of the TOE. The
Flashloader OS (optional) supports download of code and data to Flash by the Composite
Product Manufacturer before Operational Usage (e.g. during development). The
Symmetric Crypto Library (optional) provides simplified access to frequently used
symmetric cryptography algorithms.

6.       Documentation
The evaluated documentation as outlined in table 2 is being provided with the product to
the customer. This documentation contains the required information for secure usage of
the TOE in accordance with the Security Target.
Additional obligations and notes for secure usage of the TOE as outlined in chapter 10 of
this report have to be followed.

7.       IT Product Testing
The developer‚Äôs testing effort can be summarised in the following aspects.
TOE test configuration and Developer‚Äôs testing approach:
     ‚Ä¢   All TSF and related security mechanisms, subsystems and modules are tested in
         order to assure complete coverage of all SFR.
     ‚Ä¢   Different classes of tests are performed to test the TOE in a sufficient manner
         ‚Ä¢   Functional Module verification: For the functional verification, black-box testing
             and white-box testing is performed to ensure the correct functionality as
             specified in the functional specification and customer specifications (ordering
             options).
         ‚Ä¢   Security Verification: This test category addresses the security mechanisms
             described in the Security Architecture description. Two main categories of
             security module verification are defined, i.e., integrity protection module




                                                                                           16 / 32
BSI-DSZ-CC-0977-V2-2019                                                       Certification Report




           verification (fault injection) and DPA module verification (side-channel analysis).
           This also includes black-box and white-box testing.
       ‚Ä¢   Characterization: This mostly addresses production tests to measure varying
           parameters in post-silicon verification while all parameters are within the
           specified limits. The developer performs a Matrix Characterization Run to
           measure parameters using varying processes (corner material) and different
           temperatures.
       ‚Ä¢   Qualification: This test category ensures that a developed IC is production ready
           and has the expected quality. This addresses
           ‚Ä¢   electrostatic discharge due to electrostatic stress in the field (contactless
               communication),
           ‚Ä¢   fast aging of the device due to high temperatures to guarantee the life time of
               the product
           ‚Ä¢   Flash qualification to ensure that features like anti-tearing and wear levelling
               work as specified,
           ‚Ä¢   Package qualification to ensure that the IC can be placed in the final delivery
               form (package) under industrial environments and the final product quality is
               achieved, and
           ‚Ä¢   PUF qualification to ensure that the promised PUF properties hold in field
               conditions.
       ‚Ä¢   Validation: Execution of all customer-visible use cases to ensure that the entire
           system works as defined for customer-visible operation. This includes
           ‚Ä¢   on-chip test framework developed to use each officially released product
               variant and execute each public available API,
           ‚Ä¢   a Java Card OS is used to execute reference transactions for banking and
               egov.
Independent Testing according to ATE_IND
Testing approach:
   ‚Ä¢   The evaluator's objective regarding this aspect was to test the functionality of the
       TOE as described in the ST and to verify the developer's test results by repeating
       developer's tests and additionally add independent tests.
   ‚Ä¢   In the course of the evaluation of the TOE the following classes of tests were
       carried out:
       ‚Ä¢   Module tests,
       ‚Ä¢   Simulation tests,
       ‚Ä¢   Tests in User Mode of logical card A and B,
       ‚Ä¢   Tests in System Mode of card A and B,
       ‚Ä¢   Tests in test mode
       ‚Ä¢   Hardware tests and
       ‚Ä¢   Cryptographic library tests.


                                                                                           17 / 32
Certification Report                                                       BSI-DSZ-CC-0977-V2-2019




     ‚Ä¢   With this kind of tests the entire security functionality of the TOE was tested.
Penetration Testing according to AVA_VAN
Overview:
     ‚Ä¢   The penetration testing was partially performed using the developer‚Äôs testing
         environment, partially using the test environment of the evaluation body.
     ‚Ä¢   All configurations of the TOE being intended to be covered by the current evaluation
         were tested.
     ‚Ä¢   The overall test result is that no deviations were found between the expected and
         the actual test results; moreover, no attack scenario with the attack potential high
         was actually successful.
Penetration testing approach:
     ‚Ä¢   Systematic search for potential vulnerabilities and known attacks in public domain
         sources, use of a list of vulnerabilities, and from a methodical analysis of the
         evaluation documents.
     ‚Ä¢   Analysis why these vulnerabilities are unexploitable in the intended environment of
         the TOE.
     ‚Ä¢   If the rationale is suspect in the opinion of the evaluator penetration tests are
         devised.
     ‚Ä¢   Even if the rational is convincing in the opinion of the evaluator penetration tests are
         devised for some vulnerabilities, especially to support the argument of non-
         practicability of exploiting time in case of SPA, DPA and FI attacks.

8.       Evaluated Configuration
The N7021 VA can be delivered with various configuration options as described in chapter
1.4.2 of [6] and [9]. The configuration options are divided into two groups: major
configuration options and minor configuration options.
Three major configurations can be chosen by the customer during the ordering process:
     ‚Ä¢   Configuration based on 320 kBytes of Flash memory as code space,
     ‚Ä¢   Configuration based on 240 kBytes of Flash memory as code space,
     ‚Ä¢   Configuration based on 144 kBytes of ROM memory as code space.
Each major configuration is provided with several minor configuration options. These minor
configuration options (and all others) for NXP Secure Smart Card Controller N7021 VA can
be selected by the customer via Order Entry Form (see [28]). The Order Entry Form
identifies all the minor configuration options, which are supported by the major
configuration.
The N7021 VA hardware platform was tested including all minor configuration options that
can be selected based on Table 1.2 in chapter 1.4.2.2 of [6] and [9]. All minor
configurations were available to the evaluator. The major configuration does not have
dependencies to security features. All minor configuration options that are part of the
evaluation were tested. The minor configuration options behave as specified and
described in [11] and [20]. Therefore the results described in this document are applicable
for all minor configurations described in [6] and [9].



                                                                                            18 / 32

The TOE does not include a customer-specific Security IC Embedded Software.

9.        Results of the Evaluation
9.1.       CC specific results
The Evaluation Technical Report (ETR) [7] was provided by the ITSEF according to the
Common Criteria [1], the Methodology [2], the requirements of the Scheme [3] and all
interpretations and guidelines of the Scheme (AIS) [4] as relevant for the TOE.
The Evaluation Methodology CEM [2] was used for those components up to EAL 5
extended by advice of the Certification Body for components beyond EAL 5 and guidance
specific for the technology of the product [4] (AIS 34).
The following guidance specific for the technology was used:
(i)        The Application of CC to Integrated Circuits
(ii)       Application of Attack Potential to Smartcards
(iii)      Guidance, Smartcard Evaluation
(see [4], AIS 25, AIS 37).
For RNG assessment the scheme interpretations AIS 31 was used (see [4]).
To support composite evaluations according to AIS 36 the document ETR for composite
evaluation [10] was provided and approved. This document provides details of this
platform evaluation that have to be considered in the course of a composite evaluation on
top.
As a result of the evaluation the verdict PASS is confirmed for the followin g assurance
components:
‚óè     All components of the EAL 6 package including the class ASE as defined in the CC (see
      also part C of this report).
‚óè     The components ASE_TSS.2, ALC_FLR.            BSI-DSZ-CC-0977-V2-2019

A.      Certification

1.      Preliminary Remarks
Under the BSIG1 Act, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) has the task of
issuing certificates for information technology products.
Certification of a product is carried out on the instigation of the vendor or a distributor,
hereinafter called the sponsor.
A part of the procedure is the technical examination (evaluation) of the product according
to the security criteria published by the BSI or generally recognised security criteria.
The evaluation is normally carried out by an evaluation facility recognised by the BSI or by
BSI itself.
The result of the certification procedure is the present Certification Report. This report
contains among others the certificate (summarised assessment) and the detailed
Certification Results.
The Certification Results contain the technical description of the security functionality of
the certified product, the details of the evaluation (strength and weaknesses) and
instructions for the user.

‚óè   BSI certification: Application Notes and Interpretation of the Scheme (AIS) [4]

3.      Recognition Agreements
In order to avoid multiple certification of the same product in different countries a mutual
recognition of IT security certificates - as far as such certificates are based on ITSEC or
CC - under certain conditions was agreed.

3.1.    European Recognition of CC ‚Äì Certificates (SOGIS-MRA)
The SOGIS-Mutual Recognition Agreement (SOGIS-MRA) Version 3 became effective in
April 2010. It defines the recognition of certificates for IT-Products at a basic recognition
level and, in addition, at higher recognition levels for IT-Products related to certain SOGIS
Technical Domains only.
The basic recognition level includes Common Criteria (CC) Evaluation Assurance Levels
EAL 1 to EAL 4. For "Smartcards and similar devices" a SOGIS Technical Domain is in
place. For "HW Devices with Security Boxes" a SOGIS Technical Domains is in place, too.
In addition, certificates issued for Protection Profiles based on Common Criteria are part of
the recognition agreement.
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes, details on
recognition, and the history of the agreement can be seen on the website at
https://www.sogisportal.eu.
The SOGIS-MRA logo printed on the certificate indicates that it is recognised under the
terms of this agreement by the related bodies of the signatory nations. A disclaimer
beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of recognition.
This certificate is recognized under SOGIS-MRA for all assurance components selected.

3.2.    International Recognition of CC ‚Äì Certificates (CCRA)
The international arrangement on the mutual recognition of certificates based on the CC
(Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement, CCRA-2014) has been ratified on 08
September 2014. It covers CC certificates based on collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP)
(exact use), CC certificates based on assurance components up to and including EAL 2 or
the assurance family Flaw Remediation (ALC_FLR) and CC certificates for Protection
Profiles and for collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP).
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes can be seen on
the website: https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org.
The Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement logo printed on the certificate indicates
that this certification is recognised under the terms of this agreement by the related bodies
of the signatory nations. A disclaimer beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of
recognition.
This certificate is recognized according to the rules of CCRA-2014, i. e. up to and including
CC part 3 EAL 2+ ALC_FLR components.

  The digital signature in the Document Security Object relates to all hash
  values for each data group in use according to [ICAO-9303].The
  Personalisation Agent has to ensure that the Document Security Object
  contains only the hash values of genuine user data according to [ICAO-9303].
  The CSCA must issue its certificates exclusively to the rightful organisations
  (DS) and DSs must sign exclusively correct Document Security Objects to be
  stored on travel document.

OE.Personalisation
  Personalisation of travel document
  The travel document Issuer must ensure that the Personalisation Agents
  acting on his behalf
      (i) establish the correct identity of the travel document holder and create
          the biographical data for the travel document,
      (ii) enroll the biometric reference data of the travel document holder,
      (iii) write a subset of these data on the physical Passport (optical
          personalisation) and store them in the travel document (electronic
          personalisation) for the travel document holder as defined in [ICAO-
          9303],
      (iv) write the document details data,
      (v) write the initial TSF data,
      (vi) sign the Document Security Object defined in [ICAO-9303] (in the role
          of a DS).

4.2.3 Terminal operator: Terminal receiving branch

OE.Terminal
  Terminal operating
  The terminal operators must operate their terminals as follows:
     1.) The related terminals (basic inspection systems, cf. above) are used by
        terminal operators and by travel document holders as defined in [ICAO-
        9303].
     2.) The related terminals implement the terminal parts of the PACE
        protocol [ICAO-9303] part 11, of the Passive Authentication [ICAO-
        9303] part 11 (by verification of the signature of the Document Security

         and (almost) uniformly selected nonces, if required by the protocols (for
         generating ephemeral keys for Diffie-Hellmann).
      3.) The related terminals need not to use any own credentials.
      4.) The related terminals securely store the Country Signing Public Key
         and the Document Signer Public Key (in form of CCSCA and CDS) in
         order to enable and to perform Passive Authentication of the travel
         document (determination of the authenticity of data groups stored in
         the travel document, [ICAO-9303] part 12).
      5.) The related terminals and their environment must ensure
         confidentiality and integrity of respective data handled by them (e.g.
         confidentiality of the PACE passwords, integrity of PKI certificates, etc.),
         where it is necessary for a secure operation of the TOE according to the
         current PP.

4.2.4 Travel document holder Obligations

OE.Travel_Document_Holder
  Travel document holder Obligations
  The travel document holder may reveal, if necessary, his or her verification
  values of the PACE password to an authorized person or device who definitely
  act according to respective regulations and are trustworthy.

4.2.5 Receiving State or Organisation

OE.Exam_Travel_Document
  Examination of the physical part of the travel document
  The inspection system of the receiving State or Organisation must examine
  the travel document presented by the traveler to verify its authenticity by
  means of the physical security measures and to detect any manipulation of the
  physical part of the travel document. The Basic Inspection System for global
  interoperability (i) includes the Country Signing CA Public Key and the
  Document Signer Public Key of each issuing State or Organisation, and (ii)
  implements the terminal part of PACE [ICAO-9303] part 11 and/or the Basic
  Access Control [ICAO-9303]. Extended Inspection Systems perform
  additionally to these points the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1 to verify
  the Authenticity of the presented travel document‚Äôs chip.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Counterfeit and the Assumption A.Insp_Sys by demanding the Inspection
  System       to     perform     the     Chip     Authentication     protocolv.1.
  OE.Exam_Travel_Document also repeats partly the requirements from
  OE.Terminal in [PACE-PP] and therefore also counters T.Forgery and A.
  Passive_Auth from [PACE-PP]. This is done because a new type of Inspection
  System is introduced in this PP as the Extended Inspection System is needed

      to handle the additional features of a travel document with Extended Access
      Control.


OE.AA_MRTD
      Active Authentication - Inspection Systems5
      An Active Authentication (Basic, General or Extended) Inspection system
      performs all the functions of the Basic, General and Extended Inspection
      System, and verifies the IC authenticity with an RSA or ECDSA signature
      generated by the MRTD (if available).



OE.Prot_Logical_Travel_Document
  Protection of data from the logical travel document
  The inspection system of the receiving State or Organisation ensures the
  confidentiality and integrity of the data read from the logical travel document.
  The inspection system will prevent eavesdropping to their communication with
  the TOE before secure messaging is successfully established based on the Chip
  Authentication Protocol Version 1.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP]in order to handle the Assumption
  A.Insp_Sys by requiring the Inspection System to perform secure messaging
  based on the Chip Authentication Protocol v.1.

OE.Ext_Insp_Systems
  Authorization of Extended Inspection Systems
  The Document Verifier of receiving States or Organisations authorizes
  Extended Inspection Systems by creation of Inspection System Certificates for
  access to sensitive biometric reference data of the logical travel document.
  The Extended Inspection System authenticates themselves to the travel
  document‚Äôs chip for access to the sensitive biometric reference data with its
  private Terminal Authentication Key and its Inspection System Certificate.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Read_Sensitive_Data, the Organisational Security Policy P.Sensitive_Data
  and the Assumption A. Auth_PKI as it specifies the pre-requisite for the
  Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 as it concerns the responsibilities of the
  Document Verifier and the Inspection Systems.

4.3 Security Objectives Rationale

4.3.1 Threats

4.3.1.1 Threats listed in PP PACE

T.Skimming addresses accessing the User Data (stored on the TOE or
  transferred between the TOE and the terminal) using the TOE's
  contactless/contact interface. This threat is countered by the security
  objectives        OT.Data_Integrity,        OT.Data_Authenticity        and
  OT.Data_Confidentiality through the PACE authentication. The objective
  OE.Travel_Document_Holder ensures that a PACE session can only be
  established either by the travel document holder itself or by an authorised
  person or device, and, hence, cannot be captured by an attacker.

T.Eavesdropping addresses listening to the communication between the TOE
  and a rightful terminal in order to gain the User Data transferred there. This
  threat is countered by the security objective OT.Data_Confidentiality through a
  trusted channel based on the PACE authentication.

T.Tracing addresses gathering TOE tracing data identifying it remotely by
  establishing or listening to a communication via the contactless/contact
  interface of the TOE, whereby the attacker does not a priori know the correct
  values of the PACE password. This threat is directly countered by security
  objectives    OT.Tracing   (no    gathering   TOE     tracing    data)   and
  OE.Travel_Document_Holder (the attacker does not a priori know the correct
  values of the shared passwords).

T.Forgery 'Forgery of data' addresses the fraudulent, complete or partial
  alteration of the User Data or/and TSF-data stored on the TOE or/and
  exchanged between the TOE and the terminal. Additionally to the security
  objectives from PACE PP [PACE-PP] which counter this threat, the examination
  of     the     presented   MRTD       passport    book       according    to
  OE.Exam_Travel_Document 'Examination of the physical part of the travel
  document' shall ensure its authenticity by means of the physical security
  measures and detect any manipulation of the physical part of the travel
  document.
  The threat T.Forgery also addresses the fraudulent, complete or partial
  alteration of the User Data or/and TSF-data stored on the TOE or/and
                        Security Target Lite
                                                                    Ref.:

                 Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic
                                                                Page: 64/150
                       eMRTD Configuration)

  exchanged between the TOE and the terminal. The security objective
  OT.AC_Pers requires the TOE to limit the write access for the travel document
  to the trustworthy Personalisation Agent (cf. OE.Personalisation). The TOE will
  protect the integrity and authenticity of the stored and exchanged User Data
  or/and TSF-data as aimed by the security objectives OT.Data_Integrity and
  OT.Data_Authenticity, respectively. The objectives OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper and
  OT.Prot_Abuse-Func contribute to protecting integrity of the User Data or/and
  TSF-data stored on the TOE. A terminal operator operating his terminals
  according to OE.Terminal and performing the Passive Authentication using the
  Document Security Object as aimed by OE.Passive_Auth_Sign will be able to
  effectively verify integrity and authenticity of the data received from the TOE.

T.Abuse-Func addresses attacks of misusing TOE's functionality to manipulate
  or to disclosure the stored User- or TSF-data as well as to disable or to bypass
  the soft-coded security functionality. The security objective OT.Prot_Abuse-
  Func ensures that the usage of functions having not to be used in the
  operational phase is effectively prevented.

T.Information_Leakage is typical for integrated circuits like smart cards under
  direct attack with high attack potential. The protection of the TOE against this
  threat is obviously addressed by the directly related security objective
  OT.Prot_Inf_Leak.

T.Phys-Tamper is typical for integrated circuits like smart cards under direct
  attack with high attack potential. The protection of the TOE against this threat
  is obviously addressed by the directly related security objective OT.Prot_Phys-
  Tamper.

T.Malfunction is typical for integrated circuits like smart cards under direct
  attack with high attack potential. The protection of the TOE against this threat
  is obviously addressed by the directly related security objective
  OT.Prot_Malfunction.

4.3.1.2 Additional Threats

T.Read_Sensitive_Data The threat T.Read_Sensitive_Data 'Read the sensitive
  biometric    reference   data'    is  countered     by    the   TOE-objective
  OT.Sens_Data_Conf 'Confidentiality of sensitive biometric reference data'
  requiring that read access to EF.DG3 and EF.DG4 (containing the sensitive
  biometric reference data) is only granted to authorized inspection systems.
  Furthermore it is required that the transmission of these data ensures the
  data's confidentiality. The authorization bases on Document Verifier
  certificates issued by the issuing State or Organisation as required by
  OE.Authoriz_Sens_Data 'Authorization for use of sensitive biometric reference
  data'. The Document Verifier of the receiving State has to authorize Extended
  Inspection Systems by creating appropriate Inspection System certificates for

  access to the sensitive biometric reference data as demanded                by
  OE.Ext_Insp_Systems 'Authorization of Extended Inspection Systems'.

T.Counterfeit 'Counterfeit of travel document chip data' addresses the attack of
  unauthorized copy or reproduction of the genuine travel document's chip. This
  attack is thwarted by chip an identification and authenticity proof required by
  OT.Chip_Auth_Proof 'Proof of travel document's chip authentication' using an
  authentication key pair to be generated by the issuing State or Organisation.
  The Public Chip Authentication Key has to be written into EF.DG14 and signed
  by    means     of  Documents       Security    Objects    as   demanded     by
  OE.Auth_Key_Travel_Document 'Travel document Authentication Key'.
  According to OE.Exam_Travel_Document 'Examination of the physical part of
  the travel document' the General Inspection system has to perform the Chip
  Authentication Protocol Version 1 to verify the authenticity of the travel
  document's chip. Moreover, the Active Authentication Public Key has to be
  written into EF.DG15 as demanded by OE.Auth_Key_MRTD 'MRTD
  Authentication Key'. According to OE.AA_MRTD 'Active Authentication -
  Inspection Systems' the Inspection system has to perform the Active
  Authentication Protocol to verify the authenticity of the MRTD‚Äôs chip.

  OE.Prot_Logical_Travel_Document 'Protection of data from the logical travel
  document' require the Inspection System to protect the logical travel
  document data during the transmission and the internal handling.

A.Auth_PKI 'PKI for Inspection Systems' is covered by the security objective for
  the TOE environment OE.Authoriz_Sens_Data 'Authorization for use of
  sensitive biometric reference data' requires the CVCA to limit the read access
  to sensitive biometrics by issuing Document Verifier certificates for authorized
  receiving States or Organisations only. The Document Verifier of the receiving
  State is required by OE.Ext_Insp_Systems 'Authorization of Extended
  Inspection Systems' to authorize Extended Inspection Systems by creating
  Inspection System Certificates. Therefore, the receiving issuing State or
  Organisation has to establish the necessary public key infrastructure.

4.3.3.3 Assumptions related to Active Authentication

A.Pers_Agent_AA The assumption A.Pers_Agent_AA is directly covered by
the security objective for the TOE environment OE.Personalization including
the enrolment, the protection with digital signature and the storage of the MRTD
holder personal data.

10. Obligations and Notes for the Usage of the TOE
The documents as outlined in table 2 contain necessary information about the usage of the
TOE and all security hints therein have to be considered. In addition all aspects of
Assumptions, Threats and OSPs as outlined in the Security Target not covered by the TOE
itself need to be fulfilled by the operational environment of the TOE.
The customer or user of the product shall consider the results of the certification within his
system risk management process. In order for the evolution of attack methods and
techniques to be covered, he should define the period of time until a re-assessment of the
TOE is required and thus requested from the sponsor of the certificate.
The limited validity for the usage of cryptographic algorithms as outlined in chapter 9 has
to be considered by the user and his system risk management process, too.

5 Extended Requirements


5.1 Definition of the Family FAU_SAS
To describe the security functional requirements of the TOE, the family FAU_SAS
of the class FAU (Security Audit) is defined here. This family describes the
functional requirements for the storage of audit data. It has a more general
approach than FAU_GEN, because it does not necessarily require the data to be
generated by the TOE itself and because it does not give specific details of the
content of the audit records.

The family ‚ÄúAudit data storage (FAU_SAS)‚Äù is specified as follows:

Family behavior:

This family defines functional requirements for the storage of audit data.

Component leveling:




FAU_SAS.1          Requires the TOE to provide the possibility to store audit data.

Management:        FAU_SAS.1
                   There are no management activities foreseen.

Audit:             FAU_SAS.1
                   There are no actions defined to be auditable.

FAU_SAS.1 Audit Storage


Hierarchical to:   No other components.

Dependencies:      No dependencies.

FAU_SAS.1.1 The TSF shall provide [assignment: authorized users] with the
  capability to store [assignment: list of audit information] in the audit records.


5.2 Definition of the Family FCS_RND
To describe the IT security functional requirements of the TOE, the family
FCS_RND of the class FCS (Cryptographic support) is defined here. This family
describes the functional requirements for random number generation used for
cryptographic purposes. The component FCS_RND.1 is not limited to generation

of cryptographic keys unlike the component FCS_CKM.1. The similar component
FIA_SOS.2 is intended for non-cryptographic use.

The family ‚ÄúGeneration of random numbers (FCS_RND)‚Äù is specified as follows:

Family behavior:

This f Security Target of the TOE. In the course of the evaluation of
the composite product or system it must be examined if the required measures have been
correctly and effectively implemented byamily defines quality requirements for t the product layer on top. Additionally, the
evaluation of the composite product or system must also consider the evaluation results as
outlined in the document "ETR for composite evaluation" [10].
At the point in time when evaluation and certification results are reused there might be an
update of the document "ETR for composite evaluation" available. Therefore, the certified
products list onhe generation of random numbers
which are the BSI iPACE, FIA_UAU.5/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM,        FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM      for   PACE    CAM)    and
  FCS_CKM.4 represent some required specific properties of the protocols used.
  This objective for the data exchanged is mainly achieved by FDP_UCT.1/TRM,
  FDP_UIT.1/TRM and FTP_ITC.1/PACE using FCS_COP.1/PACE_ENC resp.
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC. A prerequisite for establishing this trusted channel is a
  successful PACE or Chip and Terminal Authentication v.1 FIA_UID.1/PACE,
  FIA_UAU.1/PACE (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM, FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE
  CAM) using FCS_CKM.1/DH_PACE resp. FCS_CKM.1/CA and possessing the
  special properties FIA_UAU.5/PACE, FIA_UAU.6/PACE (FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM,
  FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) resp. FIA_UAU.6/EAC. FDP_RIP.1
  requires erasing the values of session keys (here: for Kenc). The SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords, the Chip
  Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication Private Key. The SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords
  and the modular invert of the CA key. FMT_MTD.1/PA requires that SOD
  containing signature over the User Data stored on the TOE and used for the
  Passive Authentication is allowed to be written by the Personalisation Agent
  only and, hence, is to be considered trustworthy. The SFR FCS_RND.1
  represents the general support for cryptographic operations needed. The SFRs
  FMT_SMF.1 and FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related.

OT.Tracing The security objective OT.Tracing aims that the TOE prevents
  gathering TOE tracing data by means of unambiguous identifying the travel
  document remotely through establishing or listening to a communication via
  the contactless/contact-based interface of the TOE without a priori knowledge
  of the correct values of shared passwords (CAN, MRZ, PIN, PUK). This
  objective is achieved as follows:
            1. While establishing PACE communication with CAN, MRZ or PUK
                (non-blocking      authentication /   authorization  data)   by
                FIA_AFL.1/PACE,
            2. while establishing PACE communication using the PIN (blocking
                authentication data) by FIA_AFL.1/Block_PIN,
            3. for listening to PACE communication and for establishing CAv1
                communication by FTP_ITC.1/PACE,
            4. and      for     listening     to  CAv1     communication     by
                FTP_ITC.1/Polymorphic. The trusted channel shall be established
                by performing the PACE, CAv1 and TAv1 protocols according to
                [TR03110TR-03110] and the Polymorphic Authentication protocol
                (PMA).

OT.Prot_Abuse-Func The security objective OT.Prot_Abuse-Func ‚ÄúProtection
  against Abuse of Functionality‚Äù is ensured by the SFRs FMT_LIM.1, FMT_LIM.2,
  FMT_LIM.1/POLY and FMT_LIM.2/POLY which prevent misuse of test
  functionality of the TOE or other features which may not be used after TOE
  Delivery.

OT.Prot_Inf_Leak The security objective OT.Prot_Inf_Leak ‚ÄúProtection against
  Information Leakage‚Äù requires the TOE to protect confidential TSF data stored
  and/or processed in the travel document‚Äôs chip against disclosure
      by measurement and analysis of the shape and amplitude of signals or the
        time between events found by measuring signals on the electromagnetic
        field, power consumption, clock, or I/O lines which is addressed by the
        SFR FPT_EMS.1,
      by forcing a malfunction of the TOE which is addressed by the SFR
        FPT_FLS.1 and FPT_TST.1, and/or
      by a physical manipulation of the TOE which is addressed by the SFR
        FPT_PHP.3.

OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper The security objective OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper ‚ÄúProtection
  against Physical Tampering‚Äù is covered by the SFR FPT_PHP.3.

OT.Prot_Malfunction The security objective OT.Prot_Malfunction ‚ÄúProtection
  against Malfunctions‚Äù is covered by (i) the SFR FPT_TST.1 which requires self-
  tests to demonstrate the correct operation and tests of authorized users to
  verify the integrity of TSF data and TSF code, and (ii) the SFRFPT_FLS.1 which
  requires a secure state in case of detected failure or operating conditions
  possibly causing a malfunction.

OT.Identification The security objective OT.Identification ‚ÄúIdentification of the
  TOE‚Äù addresses the storage of Initialisation and Pre-Personalisation Data in its
  non-volatile memory, whereby they also include the IC Identification Data
  uniquely identifying the TOE‚Äôs chip. This will be ensured by TSF according to
  SFR FAU_SAS.1. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA allows only the Manufacturer
  to write Initialisation and Pre-personalisation Data (including the
  Personalisation Agent key set). The SFR FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS requires the
  Personalisation Agent to disable access to Initialisation and Pre-personalisation
  Data in the life cycle phase ‚Äòoperational use‚Äô. The SFRs FMT_SMF.1 and
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related.

OT.AC_Pers The       security   objective  OT.AC_Pers      ‚ÄúAccess   Control   for
  Personalisation of logical travel document‚Äù addresses the access control of the
  writing the logical travel document. The justification for the SFRs FAU_SAS.1,
  FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA and FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS arises from the justification for
  OT.Identification above with respect to the Pre-personalisation Data. The write
  access to the logical travel document data are defined by the SFR
  FIA_UID.1/PACE (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM), FIA_UAU.1/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM), FDP_ACC.1/TRM and FDP_ACF.1/TRM
  in the same way: only the successfully authenticated Personalisation Agent is
  allowed to write the data of the groups EF.DG1 to EF.DG16 of the logical travel
  document only once. FMT_MTD.1/PA covers the related property of
  OT.AC_Pers (writing SOD and, in generally, personalization data). The SFR
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE lists the roles (including Personalisation Agent) and the SFR
  FMT_SMF.1 lists the TSF management functions (including Personalisation).

  be performed by TSF according to SFRs FIA_UAU.4/PACE and FIA_UAU.5/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM and FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). If the
  Personalisation Terminal wants to authenticate itself to the TOE by means of
  the Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 (after Chip Authentication v.1) with
  the Personalisation Agent Keys, the TOE will use TSF according to the
  FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the challenge), FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the
  derivation of the new session keys after Chip Authentication v.1), and
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC (for the ENC_MAC_Mode secure
  messaging), FCS_COP.1/SIG_VER (as part of the Terminal Authentication
  Protocol v.1) and FIA_UAU.6/EAC (for the re-authentication). If the
  Personalisation Terminal wants to authenticate itself to the TOE by means of
  the Authentication Mechanism with the Personalisation Agent Key, the TOE will
  use TSF according to the FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the challenge) and
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC (to verify the authentication attempt). The session keys
  are destroyed according to FCS_CKM.4 after use.

OT.Sens_Data_Conf The            security     objective      OT.Sense_Data_Conf‚Äú
  Confidentiality of sensitive biometric reference data‚Äù is enforced by the Access
  Control SFP defined in FDP_ACC.1/TRM and FDP_ACF.1/TRM allowing the data
  of EF.DG3 and EF.DG4 only to be read by successfully authenticated Extended
  Inspection System being authorized by a valid certificate according
  FCS_COP.1/SIG_VER. The SFRs FIA_UID.1/PACE and FIA_UAU.1/PACE
  (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM and FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) require the
  identification and authentication of the inspection systems. The SFR
  FIA_UAU.5/PACE requires the successful Chip Authentication (CA) v.1 before
  any     authentication    attempt   as    Extended     Inspection  System    (or
  FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). During the protected communication
  following the CA v.1 the reuse of authentication data is prevented by
  FIA_UAU.4/PACE (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). The SFR
  FIA_UAU.6/EAC and FDP_UCT.1/TRM requires the confidentiality protection of
  the transmitted data after Chip Authentication v.1 by means of secure
  messaging implemented by the cryptographic functions according to
  FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the terminal authentication challenge),
  FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the generation of shared secret and for the derivation of
  the new session keys), and FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC for
  the ENC_MAC_Mode secure messaging. The session keys are destroyed
  according to FCS_CKM.4 after use. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/CAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ requires that the Chip Authentication Key cannot be
  written unauthorized or read afterwards. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/AAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ requires that the Active Authentication Key cannot be

  Protocolv.1 defined by FCS_CKM.1/CA is performed using a TOE internally
  stored confidential private key as required by FMT_MTD.1/CAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ. The Chip Authentication Protocolv.1 [TR-03110-1]

and with further specific IC dedicated firmware in several alternative versions.

Please note that always the highest version number points to the most recent status of a library coming usually
with improvements and/or additional functionality.

Note that each of the versions of the ACL, SCL, HSL, CCL and the NRG are optional and alternatively. This means
that the TOE comes either with one of the alternative library types‚Äì depending on the user choice - or with none.
The library types can freely be combined but not two versions of the equal type. For examples ACL with SCL with
HSL with NRG is welcome but a combination of HSL in version 03.11.8339 and at the same time with HSL in
version 01.22.4346 would not work. The library types are entirely independent from each other.
The security relevant differences in the versions - if any - are detailed in chapter 8. The claims of this Security
Target take the corresponding versions into account and thus the wording in the following refers to the library
type which is cited or else the claim includes always all named versions.

The design step of this TOE is H13.

The Security Target is based on the Protection Profile PP-0084 Security IC Platform Protection Profile with
Augmentation Packages [9] as publicly available for download at https://www.bsi.bund.de and certified under
BSI-CC-PP-0084-2014.
The Security Target is built in compliance with Common Criteria v3.1 Revision 5.

The Security Target takes into account all relevant current final interpretations.

User Guidance Documentation Set
Chapter describes briefly the contents of the individual documents of the User Guidance Documentation,
while the individual documents are versioned and entitled in chapter 9 literature and references. The in this
chapter listed set of user guidance documents belongs to the TOE.

This TOE is represented by a number of various products which are all based on the equal design sources. The
TOE hardware remains entirely equal throughout all derivatives, but the usage for example in form of available
memory sizes, availability of the various interfaces, or other functions varies by means of blocking and chip
configuration. The firmware identifier on board depends on the order.
All TOE derivatives are derived from the equal hardware design results.

The TOE can be identified with the Generic Chip Identification Mode (GCIM). The IFX_CCI_000003h with options
hardware platform is identified by defined bytes of the GCIM as detailed in the HRM [1].
The unique hexadecimal values as stated in the title are:
                        ÔÇ∑ IFX_CCI_000003h
                         ÔÇ∑    IFX_CCI_000005h
                         ÔÇ∑    IFX_CCI_000008h
                         ÔÇ∑    IFX_CCI_00000Ch
                         ÔÇ∑    IFX_CCI_000013h
                         ÔÇ∑    IFX_CCI_000014h
                         ÔÇ∑    IFX_CCI_000015h
                         ÔÇ∑    IFX_CCI_00001Ch
                         ÔÇ∑    IFX_CCI_00001Dh
                         ÔÇ∑    IFX_CCI_000021h
                         ÔÇ∑ IFX_CCI_000022h
The user can easily identify from which production line a certain IC is coming. The corresponding identifier is
given in chapter 2.2.6

These bytes clearly identify the hardware platform, or, in other words, the therein possible values for
IFX_CCI_000003h with options (without prefix IFX_CCI_) represent the equal hardware platform of this TOE. This
means that the hardware entirely equals throughout all derivatives and that the differences are achieved by
configuration and blocking means only. These values are unique for this hardware platform. This means that
these values will not be used in any other platform or product.
The interpretation of the output GCIM data is clearly explained in the user guidance, Hardware Reference Manual
HRM [1].
Although the TOE is represented by a number of various products, all based on the equal design sources, the
hardware is constituted out of few slightly different mask sets enabling to adapt to various external contactless
and contact based devices not being part of this TOE. Except this external adapt capability the TOE hardware

and firmware ‚Äì depending on the order option ‚Äì remains entirely equal throughout all derivatives, but the usage
for example in form of available memory sizes, availability of the various interfaces, or other functions varies by
means of blocking and chip configuration. This blocking is applied by Infineon settings during the production
only. Again, all TOE derivatives are derived from the equal hardware design results, the IFX_CCI_000003h with
options.
The differences between the derivatives are achieved by blocking only and have no impact on the TOEs security
policies and related functions. Details are explained in the user guidance hardware reference manual HRM [1].
All product derivatives are identically from module design, layout and footprint, but are made different in their
possibilities to connect to different types of external antennas or to a contact based interface only. Therefore,
the TOE is represented and made out of different mask sets with following TOE internal and security irrelevant
differences:
The differences between the mask sets implement different input capacitances in the analogue part of the radio
frequency interface (RFI). This differentiation in the input capacitances enable for the connection of a wider
range of various antenna types. Note that external antennas or interfaces are not part of the TOE.
To each of the mask sets, an individual value is assigned, which is part of the data output of the Generic Chip
Identification Mode (GCIM). This number is located in the GCIM part individual length byte to clearly
differentiate between the mask sets related to the different input capacitances. Details are explained in the user
guidance hardware reference manual (HRM) and in the errata sheet.
There are no other differences between the mask sets the TOE is produced with.
The IFX_CCI_000003h with options products enable for a maximum of configuration possibilities defined by the
customer order following the market needs. For example, a TOE product can come in one project with the fully
available SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM1 or in another project with any other SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM ‚Äìsize below the
physical implementation size, or with a different RAM size. And more, the user has the free choice, whether he
needs the symmetric co-processor SCP, or the asymmetric co-processor Crypto2304T, or both, or none of them.
In addition, the user decides, whether the TOE comes with a free combination of software libraries or without
any. And, to be even more flexible, various interface options can be chosen as well.

To sum up the major selections, the user defines by his order:
     ÔÇ∑ the firmware identifier in several alternatives
     ÔÇ∑ the available memory sizes of the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM and RAM
     ÔÇ∑ the availability of the cryptographic coprocessors SCP and Crypto@2304T
     ÔÇ∑ the availability and free combinations of the cryptographic libraries
         ACL-1, ACL-2, ACL-3, SCL-1 and SCL-2
     ÔÇ∑ the availability of the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ Cryptographic Library
     ÔÇ∑ the availability of the Flash Loader
     ÔÇ∑ the availability of the alternative libraries HSL-1 or HSL-2 or HSL-3 or HSL-4
     ÔÇ∑ the availability of the library NRG
     ÔÇ∑ the availability of various interface options
     ÔÇ∑ the possibility to tailor the product by blocking on his own premises (BPU)
     ÔÇ∑ the possibility to apply the PIN letter in combination with the Flash Loader
The degree of freedom of the chip configuration is predefined by Infineon Technologies AG and made available
via the order tool.

Beside fix TOE configurations, which can be ordered as usual, this TOE implements optionally the so called
Billing-Per-Use (BPU) ability. This solution enables our customer to tailor the product on his own to the required

configuration ‚Äì project by project. By that BPU allows for significant reduction of logistic cost at all participating
parties and serves for acceleration of delivery of tailored product to the end-user.
BPU enables our customers to block the chip on demand into the final configuration at his own premises, without
further delivery or involving support by Infineon Technology.
The realization of it requires the presence of the Flash Loader software, enhanced with the BPU blocking
software part. The presence of the BPU ability defines the customer with his order.
The user then receives this TOE in a predefined starting configuration, for example entirely unblocked. Again,
the delivered starting configuration depends on the user order. After delivery, the user can put the TOE in
volume on his stock and can block it down to the required sizes and features, whenever a certain configuration is
required by a certain project.
Depending on the number of TOE products delivered, and their individual final blocked configuration, the
customer receives a balancing payment. By that our customers are charged only for the true configurations
required in their projects.
As written above, the software realizing the user allowed blocking, is implemented and delivered in the TOE ‚Äì
depending on the order - and is part of the evaluation and certificate. This software is an additional part of the
Flash Loader software but also the other firmware ‚Äì in all alternative versions - has seen a small enhancement to
enable for BPU.
If BPU is available, the blocking is done by the user at user premises, usually by taking an enhancement of the
user own personalization flow and applying the according APDUs. These APDUs are predefined by Infineon
Technologies and can also depend on the customer order. Only these APDUs can block the chip according to the
user demands.
Infineon Technologies AG provides special software, running in parallel when doing the blocking. This software
summarizes all devices and final configurations allowing for the later commercial balancing. The balancing
depends on the number of chips and their individual final blockings the user has made over a defined time span.
This special software can be used only for the commercial balancing, is not present on the TOE, not security
relevant and therefore not part of this certificate.
All blockings are done by setting the according value in the chip configuration page, where certain parts are left
available to the blocking software. Strong means of authentication are in place. The blocking software
respectively BPU software is an additional part of the Flash Loader software and the only piece of software, able
to manage the blocking APDUs. Therefore, the presence of the Flash Loader software is essential for the BPU
ability.
The user can only apply a predefined and checksum protected set of allowed APDU configuration commands
provided by Infineon Technologies AG. For this, the Flash Loader BPU software part, together with the firmware
‚Äì regardless of the version used -, executes one of those APDUs. After the final blocking is done and the user
additionally may have downloaded his software, the entire Flash Loader including the BPU software part is
permanently deactivated. This is called locking of the Flash Loader.
Of course, exclusively all security relevant settings are contained in the IFX-only part. The Flash Loader BPU
software does not access and has no access to the IFX-only part.
Once the user blocking by applying the APDU has been finalized, the configuration page is no more accessible
for changes. After the locking of the Flash Loader, the product is permanently fixed regarding its configurations
and software. A reactivation of the Flash Loader is not possible. At the next start-up, the Boot-Up-Software
(BOS) applies the made settings, and, if called, a Resource Management System (RMS)-function can output the
finally made chip configuration for verification and information purposes.
The entire configuration storage area is protected against manipulation, perturbation and false access. Note that
the IFX-only part of the configuration page is already access protected prior delivery to the user and the TOE
leaves the Infineon Technology premises only locked into User Mode.
The BPU software part is only active on the products which have been ordered with the BPU option. In all other
cases this software is disabled on the product. If a product is ordered without Flash Loader, also the Flash Loader
software is disabled and the BPU configuration changes are blocked in the IFX-configuration, which renders BPU
functionality unusable. Therefore, the BPU feature is only possible if the Flash Loader is active.

If the user decides to use the Flash Loader, regardless whether it is ordered with or without BPU, an additional
process option can be ordered which results in an additional status of the Flash Loader. This process is called PIN-
Letter and enables for simplified logistics and thereby for faster delivery of the ordered TOE products to the user.
The PIN-Letter feature enabling for the PIN-Letter process is an implemented part of the Flash Loader. The
resulting logistical acceleration is possible since the PIN-Letter enables for delivery of not user-specific
configured, not flashed and not personalized TOE products to the user warehouse.
Extra authentication means applied in the PIN-Letter status of the Flash Loader preserve that only the intended
user with the intended PIN-Letter can configure with user specific information and enable the normal Flash
Loader functions in a second step. By that the user orders the products and receives - in a protected way - the
belonging PIN-Letter. PIN-Letter and delivered chips must match.
By delivery the user warehouse gets filled and depending on market demands the user can immediate apply the
authentication means of the PIN-letter. If passing, the TOE products become user specific configured and the
Flash Loader can be used for this specific user in a second step.
The following table outlines the different ways how the user can input his software on this TOE ‚Äì a TOE without
user available ROM. User software comprises usually the operating system and applications, which are for
Infineon Technologies simply a user data package which is handled as a fixed data package during production.
This provides high process flexibility for the user of which an overview is given in the following table:

For the cases with active Flash Loader on board and whenever the user has finalized his SW-download,
respectively the TOE is in the final state and about to be delivered to the end-user, the user is obligated to lock
the Flash Loader. This locking is the final step and results in a permanent deactivation of the Flash Loader. This
means that once being in the locked status, the Flash Loader cannot be reactivated anymore.
Note that whenever a TOE comes without active Flash Loader, BPU and PIN-Letter process are not possible.
All in all various delivery combinations are given and for example, a product can come with a fix configuration
and with Flash Loader, to enable the user to download software, but without BPU option and with PIN-Letter.
The following cases can occur:

Note that this TOE has no user available ROM. The user software and data are entirely located in a dedicated and
protected part of the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM. The long life storage endurance together with the means for error
detection and correction serves for excellent reliability and endurance.
In addition to the above listed flexible ranges, the user guidance contains a number of predefined configurations
for those customers not making use of the BPU option. All of these configurations belong to the TOE as well and
are of course made of the equal hardware and are inside the above declared ranges.
Today‚Äôs predefined configurations of the TOE are listed in the hardware reference manual HRM [1] and is
completed with the list of identification data of the derivatives. These predefined products come with the most
requested configurations and enables to produce volumes on stock in order to simplify logistic processes.
According to the BPU option, a non-limited number of configurations of the TOE may occur in the field. The
number of various configurations depends on the user and order contract only.
This TOE provides dedicated identification means and outputs the platform identifier, the design step and
further configuration information. The hardware reference manual HRM [1] is part of the user guidance and
enables for the clear interpretation of the read out identification data. More information is given in the
confidential Security Target [8].
These output data enable the user for clear identification of the TOE and also of one of the different mask sets
and therewith for examination of the validity of the certificate.
In addition, a dedicated RMS function allows reading out the present configuration in detail. The output RMS
data together with the hardware reference manual HRM [1] enables for clear identification of a product and its
configuration. All these steps for gathering identification and detailed configuration information can be done by
the user without involving the vendor, Infineon Technologies AG.

The TOE consists of the hardware part, the firmware parts in the alternative versions and the optional software
parts. The Smartcard Embedded Software, i.e. the operating system and applications are not part of the TOE.

The firmware comes with several alternative versions and consists of:
   ÔÇ∑ the Boot Software (BOS) firmware conducting configuration and testing task (see chapter 2.2.2) at start-
        up of the TOE
   ÔÇ∑ the Resource Management System (RMS) library providing essential basis functions for the management
        of the RAM, the branch table, the Memory Management Unit (MMU) and other resources
   ÔÇ∑ the optional Flash Loader enabling for the download of user software to the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM and
        required for the optional Bill per Use (BPU) feature and the PIN-letter feature
   ÔÇ∑ the Radio Frequency Application Interface (RFAPI) supporting functions located in the ROM.
        The RFAPI functions are not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF)
   ÔÇ∑ the NRG ROM part implementing some basic routines and used by the NRG if ordered.
        The NRG ROM part is not part of the TSF functionality.

The firmware parts BOS, RFAPI and NRG are implemented in a separated Test-ROM also being part of the TOE
but not available for the user. Completing firmware components are located in the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM.

The optional software parts are differentiated into following libraries:
   ÔÇ∑ The asymmetric cryptographic libraries (ACL) in following alternative versions:
       v2.08.007, v2.07.003 and v2.06.003.
           o All ACL libraries provide RSA1 2048/4096 cryptography.
                The library supports also smaller key lengths, but the certification follows the national regulation
                by the BSI1.

The RSA, EC and Toolbox libraries provide certain functionality via an API to the Smartcard Embedded Software.
The private parts of the cryptographic libraries are only used internally and have no user interface. If neither the
RSA- nor the EC library is delivered, also the belonging private parts are not on board. The Toolbox library does
not have private library parts.
Each of the libraries ACL, SCL, HSL and NRG is independent from the other libraries and also independent of the
alternative library version of the equal type. This means for example that the HSL-1 runs alone and does not need
parts of HSL-2.
A combination respectively mix up of the two alternative libraries of equal type has not been considered in the
design and is not allowed: The user can select either one or the other of the same library type or none of it.
If the user considers the optional software libraries, the TOE can be delivered including ‚Äì in free combinations ‚Äì
or not including any of the optional libraries.

If the user decides not.
This TOE is intended to be used in any application and device requiring the highest level of security, for example
as secure element in various devices with various form factors.
This member of the high security controller family features a security philosophy focusing on data integrity
instead of numerous sensors. By that two main principles combined in close synergy are utilized in the security
concept called the Integrity Guard. These main principles are the comprehensive error detection, including the
double CPU, and the full encrypted data path, leaving no plain data on the chip. These principles proved that
they provide excellent protection against invasive and non-invasive attacks known today.
The intelligent shielding algorithm finishes the upper layers, finally providing the so called intelligent implicit
active shielding I2-shield. This provides physical protection against probing and forcing.
This TOE provides multiple contact based and contactless interface options for various applications and markets.
Due to the interface flexibility the product can be used in almost any application, within any device and almost
any form factor. Due to these multiple communication possibilities, the TOE can be seen as a stand-alone
security device being capable to maintain the various communication interfaces simultaneously. Therefore this
TOE is able to run multiple applications, using multiple interfaces independently at the same time.
Again these multiple communication and application independency capabilities enable the usage to almost
everywhere, where highly secure applications are in use and of course in any other application as well. This TOE
is deemed for governmental, corporate, transport and payment markets, or wherever a secure root of trust is
required. Various types of applications can use this TOE, for example in closed loop logical access controls,
physical access controls, secure internet access control and internet authentication, or as multi-application token
or simply as encrypted storage.
This dual interface controller is able to communicate using either the contact based or the contactless interface.
The implemented dual interface provides a maximum flexibility in using following communication protocols
respectively methods:

The TOE provides a real 16-bit CPU-architecture and is compatible to the MCS¬Æ251 instruction set with an
execution time faster than a standard MCS¬Æ251 microcontroller at the same clock frequency. The major
components of the core system are the two CPUs (Central Processing Units), acting as one, the MMU (Memory
Management Unit) and the MED (Memory Encryption/Decryption Unit). The Core implements also the Post
Failure Detection (PFD) covering CPU, Cache and MED. The two CPUs control each other in order to detect faults
and serve by this for data integrity. The TOE implements a full 16 MByte linear addressable memory space for
each privilege level, a simple scalable Memory Management concept and a scalable stack size. The flexible
memory concept consists of a ROM, RAM and the non-volatile memory (NVM), which we call SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢
NVM. The ROM is not available for the user.
The ROM is not available for the user and contains the main parts of firmware components only.

The firmware comes in several alternative versions and is composed out of the:
   ÔÇ∑ Boot-up software (BOS), the Resource Management System (RMS), the Flash Loader (FL), the NRG code
        part located in the ROM and the RFI supporting functions. The BOS applies the essential configuration,
        internal testing and the start-up.
        The NRG ROM part and the RFI supporting functions are not part of the TOE Security Functionality
        (TSF).
   ÔÇ∑ The RMS implements a low level application interface (API) to the Smartcard Embedded Software and
        provides handling and managing routines for RAM, MMU, Branch table, configuration and further
        functions.
   ÔÇ∑ The Flash Loader allows downloading user software to the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM during the
        manufacturing process and also at user premises ‚Äì if ordered.
   ÔÇ∑ The Radio Frequency Interface Application Interface (RFAPI) functions consist of executable code in the
        ROM which is part of the TOE and a SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM code part which is delivered separately to the
        user and which is not part of the TOE. The RFAPI is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
   ÔÇ∑ The NRG software part located in the ROM. These routines are only called if the NRG library is executed;
        else these routines are not used. The NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

With regard to the RFAPI part, this means that the TOE products are delivered without the code part located in
the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM. This RFAPI part is a piece of software delivered separated from the chip in order to be
implemented by the user together with his software. Only the RFAPI SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM code part can call the
RFAPI ROM functions and optimize the contactless communication. Therefore, the RFAPI ROM functions do not
implement a user interface. In general the RFAPI implements a fast TOE startup and simplifies the user settings

are access protected and only the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM part, which is not part of the TOE, implements the user
interface. The RFAPI is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

This TOE implements a Hybrid Random Number Generator (HRNG). This HRNG equals to the expression Hybrid
Physical True Random Number Generator (hybrid PTRNG) as defined by the BSI. In the following, the BSI
expression hybrid PTRNG is used. The hybrid PTRNG implements a true physical random source and has
evidenced its conformance to the classes of AIS31 [13] as declared in chapter 7.1.1.1.
The produced genuine random numbers are available as a security service for the user and are also used for
internal purposes. Together with the guidelines in [6] the hybrid PTRNG operates in the following modes of
operation and is conformant to the named classes:
    ÔÇ∑ True Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.2
    ÔÇ∑ Hybrid Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.3
    ÔÇ∑ Deterministic Random Number Generation (DRNG) AIS31 DRG.3
    ÔÇ∑ Key Stream Generation (KSG), stream cipher generation AIS31 DRG.2
The hybrid PTRNG is deemed for any application requiring excellent physical random data entropy.

The two cryptographic coprocessors serve the need of modern cryptography:
   ÔÇ∑ The symmetric co-processor (SCP) combines both AES and DES with one, two or triple-key hardware
       acceleration. Please note that the single DES algorithm is not in the scope of evaluation due to national
       regulation by BSI.
   ÔÇ∑ And, the Asymmetric Crypto Co-processor, called Crypto@2304T, provides optimized high performance
       calculations for the user software executing cryptographic operations and is also used by the optional
       cryptographic libraries for Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and Elliptic Curve (EC) cryptography.

    ÔÇ∑ implements the high level interface to hardware cryptographic coprocessor Crypto2304T which runs the
        basic long number calculations (add, subtract, multiply, square) with high performance.
The RSA library is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software.
Following the national BSI recommendations, RSA key lengths below 1976 bits are not included in the certificate.
Please note that the BSI expects this key length as appropriate until 2022 and recommends for longer usage

    ÔÇ∑ EC curves over prime field Fp, as well as over GF(2n) finite field are supported too.
The EC library is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software.

lengths of 160, 163, 192, 224, 233, 256, 283, 320, 384, 409, 512 or 521 bits.
The definition of the key lengths follows the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100 bit security level by the
BSI.
Numerous other curve types, being also secure in terms of side channel attacks on this TOE, exist, which the user
optionally can add in the composition certification process.

If the user decides not to use any of the offered cryptographic library(s), regardless of the version, none of the

Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)


The SCL implements already several bgeted security level, which can be further increased by
simple means of configuration options.
The key lengths used for the AES and DES functionality follow the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100
bit security level issued by the BSI1. This regulation excludes the single DES operation from the certification as it
is considered to be not sufficiently secure from algorithm perspective.
For both versions, the certification covers the SCL cryptographic functionality of the AES algorithm with key
lengths of 128, 192, 256 bits and the TDEA or TripleDES (TDES) algorithm with an effective key size of 112 and
168 bits. For the version v2.04.002 the certification covers the CMAC functionality too.

Note that this TOE can come with both cryptographic co-processors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a
blocked Crypto2304T, or with both cryptographic co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the user‚Äôs
choice. No accessibility of the deselected cryptographic co-processors is without impact on any other security
policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the situation where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic
co-processors.

Beside the inclusion and support of cryptographic libraries this TOE comes with the optional Hardware Support
Library (HSL) in different alternative versions, significantly simplifying the management of the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢
NVM functionality. The HSL constitutes an application interface (API) accessing the HSL state machine and
abstracting low level properties like special function registers and settings of specific hardware features. In short
the HSL provides a user friendly also use case oriented interface considering endurance, reliability and
performance. In certain configurations the HSL provides also functions implementing tearing safe behaviour of
the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM. If used the user has no need to care about cases where the TOE is suddenly cut off the
power supply even during managing the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM.
Anyhow, the HSL remains as an optional library as even sudden power off situations does never lead to
exploitable conditions of the TOE. In the worse the TOE ends operation in case of a faulty programmed SOLID
FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM location due to the Integrity Guard.
In addition to the above, the HSL in version 03.12.8812 and 03.11.8339 provide an advanced additional method
called Incremental Write (IWR). This method provides enhanced endurance of the SOLID FLASH NVM even
beyond the erase endurance limits for often written objects. Thus this method serves applications with a demand
for high endurance and fast writing times. On the other hand, the read times using this method are slower than
the other methods provided.

The order option CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ Cryptographic Library (CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL) provides cryptographic functionality to
implement a CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ V2 conformant protocol.
This protocol provides a secure mutual authentication of two entities, namely the terminal (denoted as PCD =
Proximity Coupling Device (CIPURSE‚Ñ¢-compliant terminal)) and a smart card or a token in other form factors
which is called PICC. PICC stands for Proximity Integrated Circuit Card (CIPURSE‚Ñ¢-compliant card).
Beside the mutual authentication, the protocol implements measures to maintain the integrity of the transferred
data and preserves in parallel the confidentiality of the transferred data.
By that the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL supports the user to implement systems conformant to the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ open standard
implementing a secured, interoperable and flexible transit fare collection solution, including ISO 7816, ISO/IEC
14443-4 communication and AES-128 bit cryptography for multiple payment types.

Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)


By that the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL supports the user to implement systems conformant to the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ open standard
implementing a secured, interoperable and flexible transit fare collection solution, including ISO 7816, ISO/IEC
14443-4 communication and AES-128 bit cryptography for multiple payment types.
The order option of the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL is conformant to the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ open standard [18] for both, the PICC and
then PCD software parts. It implements the by the OSPT alliance standardized application interface for the card
and the terminal side.
The scope of this certification of this TOE covers all parts of the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL which are later implemented by
the user on the user card respectively token based on this TOE and the functionality of the PCD software part
which is implemented in the terminal side. The PCD software operates also on the hardware of this TOE which is
implemented in the terminal.
The CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL implements the by the OSPT alliance standardized application interface for the card and the
terminal side.

The NRG Software is a further order option and implements the routines for a NRG interface. The NRG
implements an operating system handling the emulation of an NRG card together with the RF interface. One
part of the NRG is permanently stored in the ROM and the second part consisting of patch and API is located in
the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM. The second part is only present if the NRG is part of the delivery. If the NRG is not part
of the delivery the ROM part is present but not used. The NRG implements tearing safe behaviour in context with
the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM management and is therefore independent from the HSL. The NRG is not part of the
TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

To fulfill the highest security requirements for smartcards today and also in the future, this TOE implements a
progressive digital security concept, which already has been certified in various forerunner processes. This TOE
utilizes digital security features to include customer friendly security, combined with a robust design overcoming
the disadvantages on analogue protection technologies. The TOE provides full on-chip encryption covering the
complete core, busses, memories and cryptographic co-processors leaving no plain data on the chip. A further
security feature has been implemented for this TOE protecting also the involved addresses transferred over the
memory bus. Therefore the attractiveness for attackers is a step further extremely reduced as encrypted signals
are of no use for the attacker ‚Äì neither for manipulation nor for eavesdropping.
In addition, the TOE is equipped with a comprehensive error detection capability for the complete data path. The
dual CPU approach allows error detection even while processing. A comparator detects whether a calculation
was performed without errors. This approach does not leave any parts of the core circuitry unprotected. The
concept allows that the relevant attack scenarios are detected, whereas other conditions that would not lead to
an error would mainly be ignored. That renders the TOE robust against environmental influences.
Furthermore, the TOE implements what we call intelligent implicit shielding (I2). These measures constitute a
shield on sensitive and security critical signals which is not recognizable or obvious as a shield. This provides
excellent protection against invasive physical attacks, such as probing, forcing or similar.
In this Security Target the TOE is briefly described and a summary specification is given. The security
environment of the TOE durlock cipher modes as declared in this document and covering a wide range
of applications, the SCL offers in addition the flexibility to implement additional block cipher modes defined by
the user.
This library provides a simplified interface to the hardware Symmetric Cryptographic Coprocessor (SCP) and
preserves the security and performance requirements as required by the user.
Note that the definition of the key lengths follows the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100 bit security
level by the BSI. This excludes the single DES operation from the certification.

Beside the inclusion and support of cryptographic libraries this TOE comes with the optional Hardware Support
Library (HSL) in different versions significantly simplifying the management of the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM
functionality. The HSL constitutes an application interface (API) accessing the HSL state machine and
abstracting low level properties like special function registers and settings of specific hardware features. In short
the HSL provides a user friendly also useing its different phases of the lifecycle is defined. The assets are identified which
have to be protected through the security policy. The threats against these assets are described. The security
objectives and the security policy are defined, as well as the security requirements. These security requirements
are built out of the security functional requirements as part of the security policy and the security assurance
requirements. These are the formal steps applied during the evaluation and certification showing that the TOE
meets the targeted requirements. In additi case oriented interface considering endurance, reliability and
performance requirements.
In certain configurations each of the HSL versions provide also functions implementing tearing safe behavon, simplified functionality of the TOE matching the requirements is
described.
