1.3 TOE Overview
The Security Target (ST) defines the security objectives and requirements for a
contact or contactless based chip of machine readable travel documents (MRTD)
based on the requirements and recommendations of the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO), EU requirements for biometric European passport
(Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 and Commission Implementing Decision
6181) and Biometric European Resident Permit (REGULATION (EU) 2017/1954
and Commission Implementing Decision 6178). This product is intended to
enable verification of the authenticity of the travel document and to identify its
holder during a border control, using an inspection system. The verification
process is based on Extended Access Control with Password Authenticated
Connection Establishment (PACE) and optionally Active Authentication (AA).

The main features and their origin are the following:
ï· Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
   according to ICAO Technical Report âSupplemental Access Controlâ [ICAO-
   9303] part 11 and strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0068-V2 [PACE-PP] for
   protection of the communication between terminal and chip. The following
   PACE mapping modes are supported and covered by the TOE:
      o    Generic Mapping (PACE-GM)
      o    Integrated Mapping (PACE-IM)
      o    Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM), which combines PACE-GM
           with Chip Authentication into a single protocol.

    according to BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1], [TR-03110-3] and
    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    travel documentâs chip to the inspection system.
ï·   Terminal Authentication v1
    according to BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1], [TR-03110-3] and
    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    inspection system to travel documentâs chip and protects the confidentiality
    and integrity of the sensitive biometric reference data during their
    transmission from the TOE to the inspection system.

As a feature that can be optionally configured the TOE supports:
ï·   Active Authentication
    which according to [ICAO-9303] prevents copying the SOD and proves that it
    has been read from the authentic chip. It proves that the chip has not been
    substituted.


ï·   Polymorphic Authentication
    which according to [PCA-eMRTD] provides additional privacy by randomisation
    of returned Polymorphic Identities, Polymorphic Pseudonyms and
    Complementary Polymorphic ID attributes in combination with standard ICAO
    and EAC1 eMRTD protocols specified in ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] and BSI
    TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1] and [TR 03110-3].

The TOE may also be used as an ISO driving license, compliant to ISO/IEC 18013
or ISO/IEC TR 19446 supporting PACE, AA and CA, as both applications (MRTD
and IDL) share the same protocols and data structure organization. Therefore, in
the rest of the document, the word âMRTDâ MAY be understood either as a MRTD
in the sense of ICAO, or a driving license compliant to ISO/IEC 18013 or ISO/IEC
TR 19446 depending on the targeted usage envisioned by the issuer.

Application note
This TOE claims an assurance level EAL5 augmented with AVA_VAN.5 and
ALC_DVS.2. AVA_VAN.5 implies that the TOE is resistant to attacks performed by
an attacker possessing "High attack potential".
Not all key sizes specified in this security target have sufficient cryptographic
strength for satisfying the AVA_VAN.5 âhigh attack potentialâ. In order to be
protected against attackers with a "high attack potential", sufficiently large
cryptographic key sizes SHALL be configured for this TOE. References can be
found in national and international document standards. Further details have
been specified in the TOEâs guidance documentation [AGD_PRE].

[TR-03110] have also been refered to in ISO18013 for EU driving licences. The
BAP-1 protocol defined in ISO18013 is equal to Basic Access Protocol (BAC)
defined in [ICAO-9303]. As to the logical data structure, the ISO18013 uses the
same concept of Passive Authentication defined in [ICAO-9303], but specifies
different ISO7816-4 elementary file identifiers for storing the ICAO defined
content of DG3, DG4 and DG15.

Polymorphic eMRTD.


1.4.2.1 ICAO/EAC eMRTD and ISO Driving licence
This sub section explains the TOE security features for operational use of TOE
configured as ICAO/EAC eMRTD or as Driving Licence.

A State or Organisation issues travel documents to be used by the holder for
international travel. The traveller presents a travel document to the inspection
system to prove his or her identity. The travel document in context of this
Security Target contains:
  I.  visual (eye readable) biographical data and portrait of the holder,
 II.  a separate data summary (MRZ data) for visual and machine reading using
       OCR methods in the Machine readable zone (MRZ) and
III.  data elements on the travel documentâs chip according to LDS in case of
       contactless machine reading.

The authentication of the traveller is based on:
  I.  the possession of a valid travel document personalized for a holder with
      the claimed identity as given on the biographical data page and
 II.  biometrics using the reference data stored in the travel document.

                              eMRTD Configuration)


The issuing State or Organization ensures the authenticity of the data of genuine
travel documents. The receiving State trusts a genuine travel document of an
issuing State or Organization.

For this Security Target the travel document is viewed as unit of:
(i) the physical part of the travel document in form of paper and/or plastic
    and chip. It presents visual readable data including (but not limited to)
    personal data of the travel document holder
    (a) the biographical data on the biographical data page of the travel
         document surface,
    (b) the printed data in the Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) and
    (c) the printed portrait.

(ii) the logical travel document as data of the travel document holder stored
     according to the Logical Data Structure as defined in [ICAO-9303] as specified
     by ICAO on the contact based or contactless integrated circuit. It presents
     contact based / contactless readable data including(but not limited to)
     personal data of the travel document holder
     (a) the digital Machine Readable Zone Data (digital MRZ data, EF.DG1),
     (b) the digitized portraits (EF.DG2),
     (c) the biometric reference data of finger(s) (EF.DG3) or iris image(s)
          (EF.DG4) or both1,
     (d) the other data according to LDS (EF.DG5 to EF.DG16) and
     (e) the Document Security Object (SOD).


The issuing State or Organisation implements security features of the travel
document to maintain the authenticity and integrity of the travel document and
their data. The physical part of the travel document and the travel documentâs
chip are identified by the Document Number.

The physical part of the travel document is protected by physical security
measures (e.g. watermark, security printing), logical (e.g. authentication keys of
the travel documentâs chip) and organisational security measures (e.g. control of
materials, personalisation procedures) [ICAO-9303].These security measures can
include the binding of the travel documentâs chip to the travel document.

The logical travel document is protected in authenticity and integrity by a digital
signature created by the document signer acting for the issuing State or
Organisation and the security features of the travel documentâs chip.

The ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] defines the baseline security methods Passive
Authentication, advanced security access methods Basic Access Control (BAC)
and Password Authenticated Connection Establishment to the logical travel



These biometric reference data are optional according to [ICAO-9303]. This ST assumes that the issuing State or
1

Organisation uses this option and protects these data by means of extended access control.

document, Active Authentication of the travel documentâs chip, Extended Access
Control and the Data Encryption of sensitive biometrics as optional security
measure. The Passive Authentication Mechanism is performed completely and
independently of the TOE by the TOE environment.

The BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1] and [TR 03110-3] specify the
Extended Access Control protocols Chip Authentication version 1 (CAv1) and
Terminal Authentication (TAv1), which are required to get secured access to the
biometric data stored in data groups DG3 and DG4 in combination with PACE or
BAC.

This Security Target addresses the protection of the logical travel document:
   (i) in integrity by write-only-once access control and by physical means, and
   (ii) in confidentiality by the Extended Access Control Mechanism.

This Security Target addresses the Chip Authentication Version 1 described in
[TR-03110-1] and PACE-CAM described in [ICAO-9303] part 11 as an alternative
to the Active Authentication stated in [ICAO-9303].

For Basic Access Control (BAC) supported by the product, a separate evaluation
and certification is performed with ST [ST-BAC].

The confidentiality by Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
is a mandatory security feature of the TOE. The travel document shall strictly
conform to the âCommon Criteria Protection Profile Machine Readable Travel
Document using Standard Inspection Procedure with PACE [PACE-PP]. Note that
[PACE-PP] considers high attack potential.

For the PACE protocol according to [ICAO-9303] part 11, the following steps shall
be performed:
 (i) the travel document's chip encrypts a nonce with the shared password,
       derived from the MRZ resp. CAN data and transmits the encrypted nonce
       together with the domain parameters to the terminal.
 (ii) The terminal recovers the nonce using the shared password, by
       (physically) reading the MRZ or CAN data. This nonce shall be converted to
       a group generator using one of the following mapping algorithms, which
       maps a static generator to an ephemeral generator:
           a. Generic mapping (PACE-GM) or
           b. Integrated mapping PACE-IM)
 (iii) The travel document's chip and terminal computer perform a Diffie-
       Hellmann key agreement together with the ephemeral domain parameters
       to create a shared secret. Both parties derive the session keys KMAC and
       KENC from the shared secret.
 (iv) Each party generates an authentication token, sends it to the other party
       and verifies the received token.

In case of PACE with Chip Authenticated Mapping (PACE-CAM), in addition to the
steps above executed for the PACE-GM variant, the MRTD chip computes Chip
Authentication Data CAIC, encrypts them AIC = E(KSEnc, CAIC) and sends them

to the terminal. The terminal decrypts AIC and verifies the authenticity of the
chip using the recovered Chip Authentication Data CAIC.

After successful key negotiation, the terminal and the travel document's chip
provide private communication (secure messaging) [TR-03110-1], [ICAO-9303].

This Security Target requires the TOE to implement the Extended Access Control
as defined in [TR-03110-1]. The Extended Access Control consists of two parts:
  (i) the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1 and
  (ii) the Terminal Authentication Protocol Version 1 (v.1).

The Chip Authentication Protocol v.1
  (i) authenticates the travel documentâs chip to the inspection system and
  (ii) establishes secure messaging which is used by Terminal Authentication v.1
       to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the sensitive biometric
       reference data during their transmission from the TOE to the inspection
       system. Therefore Terminal Authentication v.1 can only be performed if
       Chip Authentication v.1has been successfully executed.

The Terminal Authentication Protocolv.1 consists of
  (i) the authentication of the inspection system as entity authorized by the
       receiving State or Organisation through the issuing State, and
  (ii) an access control by the TOE to allow reading the sensitive biometric
       reference data only to successfully authenticated authorized inspection
       systems.

The Active Authentication protocol may be optionally configured during
personalisation.

The issuing State or Organisation authorizes the receiving State by means of
certification the authentication public keys of Document Verifiers who create
Inspection System Certificates.


1.4.2.2 Polymorphic eMRTD

In addition to an ICAO/EAC eMRTD functionality, the TOE supports Polymorphic
eMRTD extensions that can be configured using the same applet during
personalisation. The TOEâs Polymorphic eMRTD extensions enable secure
authentication with enhanced privacy protection features. The Polymorphic
extensions provide the holder the possibility to authenticate towards a service
provider using an authentication service in a non-traceable and non-linkable
manner thanks to usage of Polymorphic ID attributes.

The Polymorphic extensions are used to configure a Polymorphic eMRTD as stand
alone application instance or next to an ICAO/EAC eMRTD/Driving application
licence instance having its own application identifier during personalisation.

                        eMRTD Configuration)

The Polymorphic eMRTD uses the same ICAO and EAC1 protocols like PACEv2,
Chip Authentication v1 (CAv1) and Terminal Authentication (v1) as defined in
[ICAO-9303], [TR-03110-1] and [TR-03110-3]. The TOEâs Polymorphic eMRTD
extensions provide the following features:

   ï·   Secure storage of the Polymorphic ID attributes during personalisation or
       the TOE.
   ï·   Polymorphic Authentication Protocol (PMA) for authenticated access with
       user consent, randomization and secure readout of the Polymorphic ID
       attributes, in combination with PACEv2 and EAC1 eMRTD protocols.
   ï·   PACEv2 protocol extended with PIN and PUK passwords, to enforce user
       authentication (document holder verification) in compliance with [TR-
       03101-3].

For Polymorphic eMRTD, the PACE protocol is configured with PIN, PUK and CAN
passwords in compliance with [TR-03110-3] during personalisation. Only PACE-
GM and PACE-IM are configurable for a Polymorphic eMRTD.

The Active Authentication protocol shall not be configured for a polymorphic
eMRTD.

The logical data structure consists only of EF.CVCA, DG14 and EF.SOD. In order
to assure a sufficient level of privacy during authentication the CAv1 private key
and EF.SOD are shared amoung a sufficient high number of personalised
Polymorphic eMRTDs, i.e. the logical data structure does not contain any unique
identifiable data.



1.4.3 TOE life cycle
The TOE life cycle is described in terms of its four life cycle phases. (With respect
to the [SIC-PP], the TOE life-cycle is additionally subdivided into 7 steps in the
ST. These steps are denoted too in the following although the sequence of the
steps differs for the TOE life cycle).

1.4.3.1 Phase 1 âDevelopmentâ
(Step1) The TOE is developed in phase 1. The IC developer develops the
integrated circuit, the IC Dedicated Software and the guidance documentation
associated with these TOE components.
The IC developer also acts as the developer of the embedded software (operating
system), which is the NXP JCOP 3 P60.

(Step2) The software developer uses the guidance documentation for the
integrated circuit and the guidance documentation for relevant parts of the NXP
JCOP 3 P60 and develops the ePassport application and the guidance
documentation associated with this TOE component.

The ePassport application (i.e. the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
(SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet run time code) may be
integrated either in ROM or in EEPROM of the chip. Depending on the intention:
      (a) the ePassport application is securely delivered directly from the
          software developer (IDEMIA development dept.) to the IC manufacturer
          (NXP). The applet code will be integrated into the ROM mask code or
          inEEPROM by the IC manufacturer, or
      (b) the ePassport application is securely delivered directly from the
          software developer (IDEMIA development dept.) to the travel document
          manufacturer (IDEMIA production dept.) .) for loading in EEPROM.

Notice that the guidance documentation of the ePassport application is always
securely delivered directly from the software developer (IDEMIA development
dept.) to the travel document manufacturer (IDEMIA production dept.).


1.4.3.2 Phase 2 âManufacturingâ
(Step3) In a first step the TOE integrated circuit is produced containing the travel
documentâs chip Dedicated Software, the parts of the travel documentâs chip
Embedded Software and in case of alternative a) the ePassport application in
ROM or in EEPROM.

The IC manufacturer writes the IC Identification Data onto the chip to control the
IC as travel document material during the IC manufacturing and the delivery
process to the travel document manufacturer. The IC is securely delivered from
the IC manufacturer to the travel document manufacturer.

If necessary the IC manufacturer adds the parts of the IC Embedded Software in
the non-volatile programmable memories (for instance EEPROM).

(Step4 optional) The travel document manufacturer combines the IC with
hardware for the contact based / contactless interface in the travel document
unless the travel document consist of the chip only.

(Step5) The travel document manufacturer
  i.  adds the IC Embedded Software or part of it in the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM) if necessary and in case
      of alternative (b), loads the ePassport application into the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM),
 ii.      creates the ePassport application and
iii.      equips travel documentâs chips with pre-personalization Data.

EAC PP Application Note 1: Creation of the application for this TOE implies
Applet instantiation.

For this Security Target the following name mappings to the protection profile
[EAC-PP-V2] apply:
   ï· IC Dedicated SW = Low level IC libraries
   ï· travel documentâs chip Embedded Software = NXP JCOP 3 P60 operating
       system.
   ï· ePassport application = IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
       (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet run time code or an
       instantiation of it.
   ï· Pre-personalization Data = Personalization Agent Key Set, Card Production
       Life Cycle (CPLC) data and buffer settings.

Both the underlying platform and IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
(SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet provide configuration and
life-cycle management functions required for TOE preparation. TOE preparation
steps are performed in manufacturing phase and consist of the following 2
activities:
    1. Platform initialisation
       2. Pre-personalisation

Platform initialisation
Platform initialisation consists of the configuration of the NXP JCOP 3 P60 in
accordance with requirements specified in the platform administrator guidance
[PLTF-PRE] by using the dedicated platform commands. Furthermore the Pre-
Personalisation Agent key set is installed and (a part of) the CPLC data is
updated. To prevent unattended tracing of the MRTD document, the NXP JCOP 3
P60 is configured such that unauthenticated access to any platform unique
idenfiable data is not possible.

      personalisation key set.
   b. [optional] In case the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
      (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet runtime code does
      not reside in ROM, it is loaded into EEPROM.
   c. Install the applet application instances depending on the desired TOE
      configuration specified in section 1.4.2, using IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with
      Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet.
   d. Set the ePassport (and if present) the Polymorphic eMRTD applet
      irreversibly in its PERSONALISATION life-cycle state by installation of the
      Personalisation Agent specific personalisation key set(s).

During step (c) the CPLC data with the IC Identifier as well as the other pre-
personalisation data is configured in the TOE. The last step (d) finalizes the TOE.
This is the moment the TOE starts to exist and is ready for delivery to the
Personalisation Agent. The guidance documentation for the Personalisation Agent
is [AGD_PRE].

The pre-personalised travel document together with the IC Identifier is securely
delivered from the travel document manufacturer to the Personalisation Agent.
The travel document manufacturer also provides the relevant parts of the
guidance documentation [AGD_PRE] and [AGD_OPE] and the Personalisation
Agent Key set to the Personalisation Agent. The following table describes the
physical delivery of the TOE components:

1.4.3.3 Phase 3 âPersonalisation of the travel documentâ
(Step 6) The personalisation of the travel document includes
  i.  the survey of the MRTD holderâs biographical data,
 ii.   the enrolment of the MRTD holder biometric reference data (i.e. the
       digitized portraits and the optional biometric reference data),
iii.   the printing of the visual readable data onto the physical MRTD,
iv.    the writing of the TOE User Data and TSF Data into the logical MRTD and
 v.    configuration of the TSF if necessary.

The step (iv) is performed by the Personalisation Agent and includes but is not
limited to the creation of:
  i.   the digital MRZ data (EF.DG1),
 ii.   the digitized portrait (EF.DG2), and
iii.   the Document security object.

The signing of the Document security object by the Document signer [ICAO-
9303] finalizes the personalisation of the genuine travel document for the travel
document holder. The personalised travel document (together with appropriate
guidance (AGD_OPE) for TOE usage if necessary) is handed over to the travel
document holder for operational use.

The personalisation of Polymorphic eMRTD application instance includes:

 i.    establishing the identity of the polymorphic eMRTD document holder,
 ii.   Requesting the required Polymorphic eMRTD ID attributes from the central
       Key Management authority,
iii.   writing Polymorphic ID attributes, Polymorphic LDS data as defined in
       [PCA-eMRTD],
iv.    writing the TSF data (PIN, PUK, CAv1 private key) as defined in [PCA-
       eMRTD],
 v.    signing the Document Security Object defined in
       [ICAO-9303] (in the role of DS).


The signing of the Document security object by the Document signer [ICAO-
9303] finalizes the personalisation of the genuine Polymorphic eMRTD document
for the travel document holder. The personalised Polymorphic eMRTD document
(together with appropriate guidance (AGD_OPE) for TOE usage if necessary) is
handed over to the Polymorphic eMRTD document holder for operational use.

Private Key.

EAC PP Application note 3: This ST distinguishes between the Personalisation
Agent as entity known to the TOE and the Document Signer as entity in the TOE
IT environment signing the Document security object as described in [ICAO-
9303]. This approach allows but does not enforce the separation of these roles.


1.4.3.4 Phase 4 âOperational Useâ
(Step 7) The TOE is used as a travel document's chip by the traveller and the
inspection systems in the âOperational Useâ phase. The user data can be read
according to the security policy of the issuing State or Organisation and can be
used according to the security policy of the issuing State but they can never be
modified.

EAC PP Application note 42: The intention of the ST is to consider at least the
phases 1 and parts of phase 2 (i.e. Step1 to Step3) as part of the evaluation and
therefore to define the TOE delivery according to CC after this phase. Since
specific production steps of phase 2 are of minor security relevance (e.g. booklet
manufacturing and antenna integration) these are not part of the CC evaluation
under ALC. Nevertheless the decision about this has to be taken by the
certification body resp. the national body of the issuing State or Organisation. In
this case the national body of the issuing State or Organisation is responsible for
these specific production steps.
Note that the personalisation process and its environment may depend on
specific security needs of an issuing State or Organisation. All production,
generation and installation procedures after TOE delivery up to the âOperational
Useâ (phase 4) have to be considered in the product evaluation process under
AGD assurance class. Therefore, the Security Target outlines the split up of
P.Manufact, P.Personalisation and the related security objectives into aspects
relevant before vs. after TOE delivery.


1.4.3.5 Non-TOE hardware/software/firmware required by the TOE
There is no explicit non-TOE hardware, software or firmware required by the TOE
to perform its claimed security features. The TOE is defined to comprise the chip
and the complete operating system and application. Note, the inlay holding the
chip as well as the antenna and the booklet (holding the printed MRZ) are
needed to represent a complete travel document. Nevertheless, these parts are
not inevitable for the secure operation of the TOE.




2
 For this ST all steps of both phase 1 and phase 2 are part of the evaluation and therefore define the TOE
delivery according to the CC evaluation after this phase.

2.3 Package Claim
This ST is conforming to assurance package EAL5 augmented with ALC_DVS.2
and AVA_VAN.5 defined in CC part 3 [CC-3].


2.4 PP Conformance Rationale
This ST claims strict conformance to [EAC-PP-V2]. According to hints in [EAC-PP-
V2] parts of the [PACE-PP] have been included into this ST. A detailed
justification is given in the following.


2.4.1 Main aspects
-   The TOE description (chapter 1.3) is based on the TOE definition and TOE
    usage of [EAC-PP, 1.1]. It was enhanced by product specific details.

-   All definitions of the security problem definition in [EAC-PP, 3] have been
    taken exactly from the protection profile in the same wording.

-   All security objectives have been taken exactly from [EAC-PP, 4] in the same
    wording, except for OT.Chip_Auth_Proof which is enhanced to support
    Active Authentication.

-   The part of extended components definition has been taken originally from
    [EAC-PP, 5].

-   All SFRs for the TOE have been taken originally from the [EAC-PP, 6.1] added
    by according iterations, selections and assignments.

-   The security assurance requirements (SARs) have been taken originally from
    the EAC-PP. The requirements are shifted to those of EAL 5+.


2.4.2 Overview of differences between the PP and the ST

The Active Authentication has been added to the TOE. For that:
- One assumption has been added to cover Active Authentication during
   personalization: A.Pers_Agent_AA
- Two security objectives for the environment have been added:
   OE.Auth_Key_MRTD and OE.AA_MRTD. These additions to the original
   objectives of the PP do not contradict with any other objective nor mitigate a
   threat (or part of a threat) meant to be addressed by security objectives for
   the TOE in the PP.
- Three security functional requirements have been added:
             ï· FCS_COP.1/SIG_GEN
             ï·   FIA_API.1/AA
             ï·   FMT_MTD.1/AAPK

                        eMRTD Configuration)

The additional functionality of Password Authenticated Connection Establishment
with Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM) has been added to the TOE. It
possesses the same security requirements as the PACE functionality, which
means that the same security problem definition is applicable for PACE-CAM.


The following additional SFRs have been defined for PACE-CAM:
             ï· FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM
             ï·   FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM
             ï·   FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM
             ï·   FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM
             ï·   FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM
             ï·   FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ
             ï·   FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_WRITE




The additional functionality of the Polymorphic eMRTD extensions has been
added to the TOE with: (i) additional security problem definition; (ii) additional
security objectives; (iii) additional SFRs. Notice that many SFRs are included
from the [EACv2-PP].

                           eneral support for cryptographic operations needed.

OT.Data_Authenticity The security objective OT.Data_Authenticity aims
  ensuring authenticity of the User- and TSF data (after the PACE
  Authentication) by enabling its verification at the terminal-side and by an
  active verification by the TOE itself. This objective is mainly achieved by
  FTP_ITC.1/PACE using FCS_COP.1/PACE_MAC. A prerequisite for establishing
  this trusted channel is a successful PACE or Chip and Terminal Authentication
  v.1       FIA_UID.1/PACE,       FIA_UAU.1/PACE        (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM,
  FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) using FCS_CKM.1/DH_PACE resp.
  FCS_CKM.1/CA and possessing the special properties FIA_UAU.5/PACE,
  FIA_UAU.6/PACE (FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM, FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM for PACE
  CAM) resp. FIA_UAU.6/EAC. FDP_RIP.1 requires erasing the values of session
  keys (here: for KMAC). FIA_UAU.4/PACE, FIA_UAU.5/PACE and FCS_CKM.4
  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM, FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM and FCS_CKM.4 for PACE
  CAM) represent some required specific properties of the protocols used. The
  SFR FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords, the
  Chip Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication Private Key. The
  SFR FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE
  passwords and the modular invert of the CA key. FMT_MTD.1/PA requires that
  SOD containing signature over the User Data stored on the TOE and used for
  the Passive Authentication is allowed to be written by the Personalisation
  Agent only and, hence, is to be considered as trustworthy. The SFR
  FCS_RND.1 represents a general support for cryptographic operations needed.
  The SFRs FMT_SMF.1 and FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles
  related.

OT.Data_Confidentiality The security objective OT.Data_Confidentiality aims
  that the TOE always ensures confidentiality of the User- and TSF-data stored
  and, after the PACE Authentication resp. Chip Authentication, of these data
  exchanged. This objective for the data stored is mainly achieved by

  (FDP_ACC.1/TRM, FDP_ACF.1/TRM). FIA_UAU.4/PACE, FIA_UAU.5/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM,        FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM      for   PACE    CAM)    and
  FCS_CKM.4 represent some required specific properties of the protocols used.
  This objective for the data exchanged is mainly achieved by FDP_UCT.1/TRM,
  FDP_UIT.1/TRM and FTP_ITC.1/PACE using FCS_COP.1/PACE_ENC resp.
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC. A prerequisite for establishing this trusted channel is a
  successful PACE or Chip and Terminal Authentication v.1 FIA_UID.1/PACE,
  FIA_UAU.1/PACE (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM, FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE
  CAM) using FCS_CKM.1/DH_PACE resp. FCS_CKM.1/CA and possessing the
  special properties FIA_UAU.5/PACE, FIA_UAU.6/PACE (FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM,
  FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) resp. FIA_UAU.6/EAC. FDP_RIP.1
  requires erasing the values of session keys (here: for Kenc). The SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords, the Chip
  Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication Private Key. The SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords
  and the modular invert of the CA key. FMT_MTD.1/PA requires that SOD
  containing signature over the User Data stored on the TOE and used for the
  Passive Authentication is allowed to be written by the Personalisation Agent
  only and, hence, is to be considered trustworthy. The SFR FCS_RND.1
  represents the general support for cryptographic operations needed. The SFRs
  FMT_SMF.1 and FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related.

OT.Tracing The security objective OT.Tracing aims that the TOE prevents
  gathering TOE tracing data by means of unambiguous identifying the travel
  document remotely through establishing or listening to a communication via
  the contactless/contact-based interface of the TOE without a priori knowledge
  of the correct values of shared passwords (CAN, MRZ, PIN, PUK). This
  objective is achieved as follows:
            1. While establishing PACE communication with CAN, MRZ or PUK
                (non-blocking      authentication /   authorization  data)   by
                FIA_AFL.1/PACE,
            2. while establishing PACE communication using the PIN (blocking
                authentication data) by FIA_AFL.1/Block_PIN,
            3. for listening to PACE communication and for establishing CAv1
                communication by FTP_ITC.1/PACE,
            4. and      for     listening     to  CAv1     communication     by
                FTP_ITC.1/Polymorphic. The trusted channel shall be established
                by performing the PACE, CAv1 and TAv1 protocols according to
                [TR03110TR-03110] and the Polymorphic Authentication protocol
                (PMA).

OT.Prot_Abuse-Func The security objective OT.Prot_Abuse-Func âProtection
  against Abuse of Functionalityâ is ensured by the SFRs FMT_LIM.1, FMT_LIM.2,
  FMT_LIM.1/POLY and FMT_LIM.2/POLY which prevent misuse of test
  functionality of the TOE or other features which may not be used after TOE
  Delivery.

OT.Prot_Inf_Leak The security objective OT.Prot_Inf_Leak âProtection against
  Information Leakageâ requires the TOE to protect confidential TSF data stored
  and/or processed in the travel documentâs chip against disclosure
      by measurement and analysis of the shape and amplitude of signals or the
        time between events found by measuring signals on the electromagnetic
        field, power consumption, clock, or I/O lines which is addressed by the
        SFR FPT_EMS.1,
      by forcing a malfunction of the TOE which is addressed by the SFR
        FPT_FLS.1 and FPT_TST.1, and/or
      by a physical manipulation of the TOE which is addressed by the SFR
        FPT_PHP.3.

OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper The security objective OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper âProtection
  against Physical Tamperingâ is covered by the SFR FPT_PHP.3.

OT.Prot_Malfunction The security objective OT.Prot_Malfunction âProtection
  against Malfunctionsâ is covered by (i) the SFR FPT_TST.1 which requires self-
  tests to demonstrate the correct operation and tests of authorized users to
  verify the integrity of TSF data and TSF code, and (ii) the SFRFPT_FLS.1 which
  requires a secure state in case of detected failure or operating conditions
  possibly causing a malfunction.

OT.Identification The security objective OT.Identification âIdentification of the
  TOEâ addresses the storage of Initialisation and Pre-Personalisation Data in its
  non-volatile memory, whereby they also include the IC Identification Data
  uniquely identifying the TOEâs chip. This will be ensured by TSF according to
  SFR FAU_SAS.1. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA allows only the Manufacturer
  to write Initialisation and Pre-personalisation Data (including the
  Personalisation Agent key set). The SFR FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS requires the
  Personalisation Agent to disable access to Initialisation and Pre-personalisation
  Data in the life cycle phase âoperational useâ. The SFRs FMT_SMF.1 and
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related.

OT.AC_Pers The       security   objective  OT.AC_Pers      âAccess   Control   for
  Personalisation of logical travel documentâ addresses the access control of the
  writing the logical travel document. The justification for the SFRs FAU_SAS.1,
  FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA and FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS arises from the justification for
  OT.Identification above with respect to the Pre-personalisation Data. The write
  access to the logical travel document data are defined by the SFR
  FIA_UID.1/PACE (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM), FIA_UAU.1/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM), FDP_ACC.1/TRM and FDP_ACF.1/TRM
  in the same way: only the successfully authenticated Personalisation Agent is
  allowed to write the data of the groups EF.DG1 to EF.DG16 of the logical travel
  document only once. FMT_MTD.1/PA covers the related property of
  OT.AC_Pers (writing SOD and, in generally, personalization data). The SFR
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE lists the roles (including Personalisation Agent) and the SFR
  FMT_SMF.1 lists the TSF management functions (including Personalisation).

  The SFRs FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ (FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ for
  PACE CAM protocol) and FPT_EMS.1 restrict the access to the Personalisation
  Agent Keys, the Chip Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication
  Private key. The authentication of the terminal as Personalisation Agent shall
  be performed by TSF according to SFRs FIA_UAU.4/PACE and FIA_UAU.5/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM and FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). If the
  Personalisation Terminal wants to authenticate itself to the TOE by means of
  the Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 (after Chip Authentication v.1) with
  the Personalisation Agent Keys, the TOE will use TSF according to the
  FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the challenge), FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the
  derivation of the new session keys after Chip Authentication v.1), and
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC (for the ENC_MAC_Mode secure
  messaging), FCS_COP.1/SIG_VER (as part of the Terminal Authentication
  Protocol v.1) and FIA_UAU.6/EAC (for the re-authentication). If the
  Personalisation Terminal wants to authenticate itself to the TOE by means of
  the Authentication Mechanism with the Personalisation Agent Key, the TOE will
  use TSF according to the FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the challenge) and
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC (to verify the authentication attempt). The session keys
  are destroyed according to FCS_CKM.4 after use.

OT.Sens_Data_Conf The            security     objective      OT.Sense_Data_Confâ
  Confidentiality of sensitive biometric reference dataâ is enforced by the Access
  Control SFP defined in FDP_ACC.1/TRM and FDP_ACF.1/TRM allowing the data
  of EF.DG3 and EF.DG4 only to be read by successfully authenticated Extended
  Inspection System being authorized by a valid certificate according
  FCS_COP.1/SIG_VER. The SFRs FIA_UID.1/PACE and FIA_UAU.1/PACE
  (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM and FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) require the
  identification and authentication of the inspection systems. The SFR
  FIA_UAU.5/PACE requires the successful Chip Authentication (CA) v.1 before
  any     authentication    attempt   as    Extended     Inspection  System    (or
  FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). During the protected communication
  following the CA v.1 the reuse of authentication data is prevented by
  FIA_UAU.4/PACE (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). The SFR
  FIA_UAU.6/EAC and FDP_UCT.1/TRM requires the confidentiality protection of
  the transmitted data after Chip Authentication v.1 by means of secure
  messaging implemented by the cryptographic functions according to
  FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the terminal authentication challenge),
  FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the generation of shared secret and for the derivation of
  the new session keys), and FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC for
  the ENC_MAC_Mode secure messaging. The session keys are destroyed
  according to FCS_CKM.4 after use. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/CAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ requires that the Chip Authentication Key cannot be
  written unauthorized or read afterwards. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/AAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ requires that the Active Authentication Key cannot be
  written       unauthorized       or      read      afterwards.      The     SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_WRITE and FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ

                              1.3 TOE Overview


                           1.3.1 Introduction
                                    The Hardware Security Target [13] contains, in section 1.3 âTOE Overviewâ, an
                                    introduction about the N7021 hardware TOE that is considered in the evaluation. The
                                    Hardware Security Target includes IC Dedicated Software provided with the N7021
                                    hardware platform.
                                    The âCrypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VAâ is a cryptographic library that can be used by
                                    the Security IC Embedded Software. The cryptographic library consists of several binary
                                    packages that are intended to be linked to the Security IC Embedded Software. The
                                    Security IC Embedded Software developer links the binary packages that he needs to his
                                    Embedded Software and the whole is subsequently implemented in arbitrary memory of
                                    the hardware platform.
                                    The NXP N7021 provides the computing platform and cryptographic support by means of
                                    co-processors for the Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA.
                                    The Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA provides the security functionality described
                                    below in addition to the functionality described in the Hardware Security Target [13] for
                                    the hardware platform:
                                    The Crypto Library provides RSA, RSA key generation, RSA public key computation,
                                    ECDSA (ECC over GF(p)) signature generation and verification, ECDSA (ECC over
                                    GF(p)) key generation, ECDH (ECC Diffie-Hellmann) key-exchange, standard security
                                    level SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512.

                                    The life cycle of the hardware platform as part of the TOE is described in section 1.4.4
                                    "Security During Development and Production" of the Hardware Security Target [13]. The

                                    on N7021 VA.
                                    The Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA is delivered in Phase 1 (for a definition of the
                                    Phases refer to Section 1.2.3 'TOE life cycleâ of the Protection Profile [5]) as a software
                                    package (a set of binary files) to the developers of Security IC Embedded Software. The
                                    Security IC Embedded Software may comprise in this case an operating system and/or

                                    The development process of the Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA is part of the
                                    evaluation. The access to the implementation documentation, test bench and the source
                                    code is restricted to the development team of the Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA.
                                    The security measures installed within NXP, including a secure delivery process, ensure
                                    the integrity and quality of the delivered Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA binary files.

                           1.3.3 Specific Issues of Hardware and the Common Criteria
                                    Regarding the Application Note 2 of the Protection Profile [5] the TOE provides additional
                                    functionality which is not covered in the Protection profile [5] and the Hardware Security
                                    Target [13]. This additional functionality is added using the policy âP.Add-CryptoLib-
                                    Funcâ (see Section 3.3 of this Security Target).

                              1.4 TOE Description
                                    The Target of Evaluation (TOE) consists of a hardware part and a software part:
                                    â¢ The hardware part consists of the N7021 with IC Dedicated Software. The hardware
                                      part of the TOE includes dedicated guidance documentation.
                                    â¢ The software part consists of the IC Dedicated Support Software âCrypto Library Cobalt
                                      on N7021 VAâ which consists of a software library and associated documentation. The
                                      Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA is an additional part that provides cryptographic
                                      functions that can be operated on the hardware platform as described in this Security
                                      Target.
                                    The hardware part of the TOE is not described in detail in this document. Details are
                                    included in the Hardware Security Target [13] and therefore this latter document will be
                                    cited wherever appropriate.
                                    The TOE components consist of all the TOE components listed in Table 1 of the
                                    Hardware Security Target [13] plus all TOE components listed in the table below:

                           1.4.1 Hardware Description
                                    The NXP N7021 hardware is described in section 1.4.3.1 âHardware Descriptionâ of the
                                    Hardware Security Target [13]. The IC Dedicated Software delivered with the hardware
                                    platform is described in section 1.4.3.2 âSoftware Descriptionâ of the Hardware Security
                                    Target [13].
                                    As described in the Hardware Security Target [13], the N7021 hardware provides the
                                    customer with a configuration option to disable the PKCC coprocessor. When the PKCC

                                    â¢ The RSA algorithm can be used for encryption and decryption as well as for signature
                                      generation, signature verification, message encoding and signature encoding.
                                    â¢ The RSA key generation can be used to generate RSA key pairs.
                                    â¢ The RSA public key computation can be used to compute the public key that belongs to
                                      a given private CRT key.
                                    The TOE supports various key sizes for RSA up to a limit of 4096 bits.
                                    RSA functionality is not available in case the customer disabled the PKCC coprocessor
                                    as part of the hardware configuration. See the Hardware Security Target [13] for more
                                    information.
                                    ECDSA (ECC over GF(p))
                                    â¢ The ECDSA (ECC over GF(p)) algorithm can be used for signature generation and
                                      signature verification.
                                    â¢ The ECDSA (ECC over GF(p)) key generation algorithm can be used to generate ECC
                                      over GF(p) key pairs for ECDSA.
                                    â¢ The ECDH (ECC Diffie-Hellman) key exchange algorithm can be used to establish
                                      cryptographic keys. It can be also used as secure point multiplication.
                                    The TOE supports various key sizes for ECC over GF(p) up to a limit of 640 bits for
                                    signature generation, key pair generation and key exchange. For signature verification
                                    the TOE supports key sizes up to a limit of 640 bits.
                                    Supported curves are any Weierstrass curves from size 128 bits to size 640 bits with co-

                                    information.
                                    SHA
                                    â¢ The SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 algorithms can be used for
                                      different purposes such as computing hash values in the course of digital signature
                                      creation or key derivation.
                                    Resistance of cryptographic algorithms against attacks
                                    The cryptographic algorithms are designed taking into account the attacks described in
                                    JIL-ATT-SC: Attack Methods for Smartcards and Similar Devices [19].
                                    Further security functionality
                                    â¢ The TOE includes internal security measures for residual information protection.
                                    Note that the TOE does not restrict access to the functions provided by the hardware:
                                    these functions are still directly accessible to the Security IC Embedded Software.


                                      1 These crypto functions are supplied as a library rather than as a monolithic program, and hence a user of
                                          the library may include only those functions that are actually required â it is not necessary to include all
                                          cryptographic functions of the library in every Security IC Embedded Software. For example, it is possible
                                          to omit the RSA or the ECC components. However, some dependencies exist; details are described in

                                    The chosen level of assurance is EAL6 + augmented.
                                    The augmentations to EAL6 are ASE_TSS.2 and ALC_FLR.1.

                                    The assurance level for evaluation and the functionality of the TOE are chosen in order to
                                    allow the confirmation that the TOE is suitable for use within devices compliant with the
                                    German Digital Signature Law.
                                    Note 1. The hardware platform is evaluated according to the assurance level EAL 6
                                    augmented. The evaluation of the hardware platform is appropriate for the composite
                                    evaluation since both the EAL level and the augmentations claimed in this Security
                                    Target are identical to those claimed for the hardware platform (refer to the Hardware
                                    Security Target [13]).

                              2.1 Conformance claim rationale
                                    According to chapter 2 this Security Target claims strict conformance to the Protection
                                    Profile [5]. As shown in 1.3 the composed TOE consists of hardware (Secure Controller
                                    IC) and software (IC Dedicated Software). This is identical to the TOE as defined in [5]
                                    and therefore the TOE type is consistent.

                                    section 3.1 of the Protection Profile apply to this Security Target. User Data and TSF
                                    data are defined as part of assets in [13]. Since the data computed by the Crypto Library
                                    contains keys, plain text and cipher text that are considered as User Data and e.g.
                                    blinding vectors that are considered as TSF data the assets are considered as complete
                                    for this Security Target.

                              3.2 Threats

OT.Chip_Auth_Proof The security objective OT.Chip_Auth_Proof âProof of
  travel documentâs chip authenticityâ is ensured by the Chip Authentication
  Protocolv.1 provided by FIA_API.1/CA and by Active Authentication provided
  by FIA_API.1/AA proving the identity of the TOE. The Chip Authentication
  Protocolv.1 defined by FCS_CKM.1/CA is performed using a TOE internally
  stored confidential private key as required by FMT_MTD.1/CAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ. The Chip Authentication Protocolv.1 [TR-03110-1]
  requires additional TSF according to FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the derivation of the
  session keys), FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC (for the
  ENC_MAC_Mode        secure    messaging).    The   SFRs     FMT_SMF.1     and
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related. The Active
  Authentication defined by FCS_COP.1/SIG_GEN for the generation of the RSA
  Signature is performed using a TOE internally stored confidential private key
  as required by FMT_MTD.1/AAPK and FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ. According to
  FDP_ACF.1, only the successfully authenticated Inspection Systems are
  allowed to request active authentication (FDP_ACF.1.2, rule 2).

6.3.3.1.1 Rationale for the exclusion of Dependencies


The dependency FMT_MSA.3 of FDP_ACF.1/TRM is discarded. The access
  control TSF according to FDP_ACF.1/TRM uses security attributes which are
  defined during the personalisation and are fixed over the whole life time of the
  TOE. No management of these security attribute (i.e. SFR FMT_MSA.1 and
  FMT_MSA.3) is necessary here.

6.3.4 Rationale for the Security Assurance Requirements
The EAL5 was chosen to permits a developer to gain maximum assurance from
positive security engineering based upon rigorous commercial development
practices supported by moderate application of specialist security engineering
techniques. Such a TOE will probably be designed and developed with the intent
of achieving EAL5 assurance. It is likely that the additional costs attributable to
the EAL5 requirements, relative to rigorous development without the application
of specialised techniques, will not be large.

6.3.5 AVA_VAN.5 Advanced methodical vulnerability analysis
The selection of the component AVA_VAN.5 provides the assurance that the TOE
is shown to be highly resistant to penetration attacks to meet the security
objectives OT.Prot_Inf_Leak, OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper and OT.Prot_Malfunction.

6.3.6 ALC_DVS.2 Sufficiency of security measures
The selection of the component ALC_DVS.2 provides a higher assurance of the
secu-rity of the MRTD's development and manufacturing especially for the secure

7.1.3 SF.ILTB Protection against interference, logical tampering
and bypass

SF.ILTB.1
  Protection against interference, logical tampering and bypass
  Security domains are supported by the Java Card platform used by the TOE
  underlying NXP JCOP 3 P60. The NXP JCOP 3 P60 provides protection against
  physical attack and performs self-tests as described in [PLTF-ST].
  The platform protects the TOE against malfunctions that are caused by
  exposure to operating conditions that may cause a malfunction. This includes
  hardware resets and operation outside the specified norms.
  The IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic
  eMRTD Configuration) Applet uses transient memory where a hardware reset
  always reverts the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
  (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet into an unauthenticated
  state.

7.1.4 SF.AC Access control / Storage and protection of logical
travel document data

SF.AC.1
  Access control / Storage and protection of logical travel document
  data
  The TOE provided access control, storage and protection of logical travel
  document data including access control to MRTD data. The TOE implements
  the subjects, objects, security attributes and rules according to the security
  attribute based access control. Access control is enforced by the APDU
  methods as specified in the interface defined in the functional specification.

7.1.5 SF.SM Secure Messaging

SF.SM.1
  Secure Messaging
  Secure messaging MAC and ENC operations are performed by the TOEâs
  platform.
  Secure messaging in ENC_MAC mode is established during PACE or re-
  established during Chip Authentication v1 and is based on SF.CF.1, 5, 6 and 8.

SF.SM.2
  Secure Messaging â Re-authentication
  The Retail MAC for 3DES and CMAC for AES are part of every APDU
  command/response when secure messaging is active after a successful PACE
  or Chip Authentication has been accomplished. Re-authentication after reset of
  the SM protocol is assured by accepting only valid (mandatory) MAC or CMAC
  cryptograms.

7.1.6 SF.LCM Security and life cycle management

SF.LCM.1
  Management of phases and roles
  For the TOE the following life-cycle phases have been identified:
      1. Manufacturing phase
      2. Personalisation phase
      3. Operational phase
      4. Termination phase
  Each life-cycle phase (or state) has its typical user acting as role holder.

                           Polymorphic eMRTD document holder
Terminated phase           None

  All role holders in Manufacturing, Pre-Personalisation and Personalisation
  phases are identified by cryptographic authentication keys. In Operational
  phase the PACE password is required to authenticate the Basic or Extended
  Inspection System in order to get access to the non-sensitive ICAO LDS
  datagroups.
  The IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic
  eMRTD Configuration) Applet maintains the internal life-cycle state the
  moment that the applet is installed. This state, together with the access
  control mechanisms force the Terminal into a specific role, for the pre-
  personalisation and subsequent, personalisation and operational phases. The
  phases (and corresponding life-cycle states) are controlled by APDU
  commands.



SF.LCM.2
  Life Cycle states of the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
  (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet
  The TOE supports the following life-cycle states:
      1. Not instantiated (applet resides in ROM or in EEPROM)
      2. PRE-PERSONALISATION state
      3. PERSONALISATION state
      4. OPERATIONAL state
      5. TERMINATED state (irreversibly)
  Each life-cycle phase (or state) has its typical user acting as role holder.

  It assumed that:
      o All authentication infrastructure keys used by the central Key
          Management       Authority     for   the    polymorphic    authentication
          infrastructure (generation and transformation of PP, PI and CPI) are
          generated, handled and stored securely.
      o The PP/PI/CPI are generated securely by the central Key Management
          Authority of the polymorphic authentication infrastructure and stored
          securely in the eMRTD polymorphic chip during the personalization
          phase.
      o The TOE communicates only with Trustworthy Authentication
          Service/Terminal during the Polymorphic Authentication.
      o The randomised PP, PI and CPI are securely received by Polymorphic
          Authentication Service/Terminal. The randomised PP, PI and CPI are
          transformed (âre-keyedâ) by the central Key Management Authority
          (i.e. ElGamal re-encryption of the randomized PP, PI and/or CPI using
          the public key of Servicez Provider, who has is authorized to read the
          plain value of identifying user attributes included in the PP, PI or CPI).
          Identification by the identifying user attributes contained inside the PP,
          PI and CPI takes place at the Service Provider.
  Application Note:
  This Assumption has been added to this ST for the polymorphic authentication
  infrastructure. This addition does not conflict with the strict conformance to
  PACE PP [PACE-PP] and EACv1 PP [EAC-PP-V2].

A.Auth_PKI_Polymorphic
  PKI for Polymorphic eMRTD It is assumed that:
     o The issuing States or Organisations establish a dedicated CVCA, DVCA
        and IS PKI for the polymorphic eMRTD infrastructure.
     o The Country Verifying Certification Authorities, the Document Verifier
        and Extended Inspection Systems hold authentication key pairs and
        certificates for their public keys encoding the access control rights for
        access to the PP, PI and (optional) CPI polymorphic user data. The
        Country Verifying Certification Authorities of the issuing States or
        Organisations are signing the certificates of the Document Verifier and
        the Document Verifiers are signing the certificates of the Polymorphic

         keys of their Country Verifying Certification Authority to their
         Polymorphic eMRTD document's chip.
      o The issuing State or Organisation establishs the necessary public key
         infrastructure in order to limit the access to Polymorphic data of
         Polymorphic eMRTD document holders to authorized Organisations. The
         Country Verifying Certification Authority of the issuing State or
         Organisation generates card verifiable Document Verifier Certificates
         for the authorized Document Verifier only.
      o The issuing State or Organisation establishs the necessary public key
         infrastructure in order to (i) generate the Polymorphic eMRTD
         document's Chip Authentication Key Pair, (ii) sign and store the Chip
         Authentication Public Key in the Chip Authentication Public Key data
         and (iii) support Polymorphic Authentication Terminals/Services to
         verify the authenticity of the Polymorphic eMRTD document's chip
         according to [TR-03110] used for genuine Polymorphic eMRTD
         document by certification of the Chip Authentication Public Key by
         means of the Document Security Object.
      o The Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer establishes a public key
         infrastructure for the card verifiable certificates used for Terminal
         Authentication. For this aim, the Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer
         shall run a Country Verifying Certification Authority. The PKI shall fulfill
         the requirements and rules of the corresponding certificate policy. The
         Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer shall make the CVCA certificate
         available to the personalization agent or the manufacturer.
      o The polymorphic eMRTD document Issuer issues the polymorphic
         eMRTD document and approves it using the terminals and
         authentication services complying with all applicable laws and
         regulations.
  Application Note:
  This Assumption is an extension of the Assumption 'A.Auth_PKI' defined in
  [EAC-PP-V2]. For the EAC functionality of the TOE the assumption is necessary
  because it covers the pre-requisite for performing the Terminal Authentication
  Protocol Version 1.

A.Insp_Sys_Polymorphic

Polymorphic Inspection Systems and authentication services
     o Polymorphic    Inspection     Systems   (Polymorphic     Authentication
       Terminals/Services) ensure the confidentiality, Privacy, Authenticity
       and integrity of the polymorphic data read from the polymorphget.

                              3.4 Assumptions
                                    The assumptions are described in the Hardware Security Target [13]. No additional
                                    assumptions are defined for this Security Target.

                                    Note 4. All introduced security objectives claiming cryptographic functionality are
                                    protected against attacks as described in JIL-ATT-SC: Attack Methods for Smartcards
                                    and Similar Devices [19], which include Side Channel Attacks, Perturbation attacks,
                                    Differential Fault Analysis (DFA) and timing attacks. The following exceptions apply:
                                    1. RSA Public Key computation and RSA Key generation do not contain protective
                                       measures against DPA
                                    2. ECDSA (ECC over GF(p)) Key Generation does not contain protective measures
                                       against DPA
                                    3. SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 do not contain protective
                                       measures against DPA, DFA and timing attacks. It provides countermeasures against
                                       template attacks targeting the input message and the output digest.
                                    This does not mean that the algorithm is insecure; rather at the time of this security
                                    target no promising attacks were found. More details about conditions and restrictions for
                                    resistance against attacks are given in the user documentation of the Crypto Library.

                              4.2 Security Objectives for the IC Embedded Software
                                    The security objectives for the Security IC Embedded Software defined in section 4.2 of
                                    the Protection Profile [5] and additional refinements in the Hardware Security Target [13]
                                    entirely apply to this Security Target.
                                    The TOE assumes that the Security IC Embedded Software abides by the provisions
                                    detailed in âClarification of Treatment of user data of the Composite TOE (OE.Resp-
                                    Appl)â contained within section 4.2 âSecurity Objectives for the Security IC Embedded
                                    Softwareâ of the Hardware Security Target [13].

                              4.3 Security Objectives for the Operational Environment
                                    The security objective for the âSecurity Objectives for the Operational environmentâ
                                    defined in the PP [5], and given in the Hardware Security Target [13] are entirely valid for
                                    this Security Target.

                              4.4 Security Objectives Rationale
                                    Section 4.4 of the Protection Profile [5] and Section 4.4 of the Hardware Security Target
                                    [13] provide a rationale how the threats, organisational security policies and assumptions
                                    are addressed by the objectives that are subject of the PP. They entirely apply to this
                                    Security Target. The justification for the additional security objectives for the Crypto
                                    Library on N7021 are listed in the table below:

                                                                                          O.ECDSA
                              (                                                           O.ECC_DHKE
                                                                                          O.ECC_KeyGen
                                                                                          O.SHA

                                    They are in line with the security objectives of the Protection Profile and supplement
                                    these according to the additional assumptions and organisational security policy.
                                    The rationale for all item defined in the Security Target is given below.
                                    Since the objectives O.RSA, O.RSA_PubExp, O.RSA_KeyGen, O.ECDSA,
                                    O.ECC_DHKE, O.ECC_KeyGen and O.SHA require the TOE to implement exactly
                                    the same specific security functionality as required by P.Add-CryptoLib-Func, the
                                    organizational security policy P.Add-CryptoLib-Func is covered by the security objectives.
                                    Additionally, the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing, O.Malfunction,
                                    O.Phys-Manipulation and O.Leak-Forced define how to implement the specific security
                                    functionality required by P.Add-CryptoLib-Func and therefore support P.Add-CryptoLib-
                                    Func. These security objectives are also valid for the additional specific security
                                    functionality since they must also avert the related threats for the components added to
                                    the organisational security policy.
                                    The justification of the additional policy and the additional assumptions show that they
                                    do not contradict with the rationale already given in the Protection Profile [5] for the
                                    assumptions, policy and threats defined there.

6         Security Requirements

                              6.1 Security Functional Requirements
                                    To support a better understanding of the combination Protection Profile and Security
                                    Target of the hardware platform (N7021) vs. this Security Target (Crypto Library Cobalt
                                    on N7021 VA), the TOE SFRs are presented in the following sections.

                           6.1.1 SFRs from the Protection Profile and the Security Target of the platform
                                    The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) for this TOE (Crypto Library Cobalt on
                                    N7021 VA) are specified based on the Smart Card IC Platform Protection Profile [5], and
                                    are defined in the Common Criteria [2] or in the Protection Profile [5]. They entirely apply
                                    to this Security Target.
                                    Note 5. These requirements have already been stated in the Hardware Security Target
                                    [13] and are fulfilled by the chip hardware, if not indicated otherwise in this Section.
                                    The additional SFRs shown in this Section are defined in the Common Criteria, described
             d FCS_CKM.4 ensures that the TOE provides procedural
                                       measures to prevent disclosure of memory contents that was used by the TOE. The
                                       Crypto Library supports FDP_RIP.1[SW] and FCS_CKM.4 by making all memory
                                       contents used by the library no longer available. Note that the requirement for
                                       residual information protection applies to all functionality of the Crypto Library.

                           6.3.2 Extended requirements
                                    This Security Target does not define extended requirements.

                           6.3.3 Dependencies of security requirements
                                    SFRs [FDP_ITC.1, or FDP_ITC.2 or FCS_CKM.1] are not included in this Security Target
                                    for FCS_COP.1/SHA since the TOE only provides a pure engine for these algorithms
                                    without additional features like the handling of keys or importing data from outside the
                                    TOE. Therefore the Security IC Embedded Software must fulfil these requirements
                                    related to the needs of the realized application.

                           6.3.4 Rationale for the Assurance Requirements
                                    The selection of assurance components and augmentations of Crypto Library on N7021
                                    is generally based on EAL6, the underlying Protection Profile [5], and the Security Target
                                    of the hardware [13] of the N7021.
                                    EAL6 was chosen to provide an even stronger baseline of assurance than the EAL4 in
                                    the Protection Profile. The augmentations ALC_FLR.1 and ASE_TSS.2 were chosen to
                                    extend the level of assurance even further.

                                    This chapter describes the âIT Security Functionalityâ.

                              7.1 IT Security Functionality
                                    The evaluation of this cryptographic library is performed as a composite evaluation,
                                    where the TOE comprises both the underlying hardware and the embedded software
                                    (Crypto Library). The TOE of this composite evaluation therefore extends the security
                                    functionality already available in the chip platform (see section 7.1 âPortions of the TOE
                                    Security Functionalityâ of the Hardware Security [13]).
                                    The security functionality of N7021
                                    The security functionality of the hardware platform for the N7021 is described in the
                                    Hardware Security Target [13]. They entirely apply to this Security Target.
                                    Note 8. The security functionality SF.LOG is extended by the Crypto Library as described
                                    in Security Features of the TOE.


                                    The additional security functionality provided by the TOE is described in the following
                                    sub-sections.
                                    The IT security functionalities directly correspond to the TOE security functional
                                    requirements defined in Section 6.1. The definitions of the IT security functionalities refer
                                    to the corresponding security functional requirements.

                           7.1.1 Security Services of the TOE

                         7.1.1.1    SS.RSA

                                    The TOE provides functions that implement the RSA algorithm and the RSA-CRT
                                    algorithm for data encryption, decryption, signature and verification. All algorithms are
                                    defined in PKCS #1, v2.2 (RSAEP, RSADP, RSAP1, RSAVP1)
                                    This routine supports various key lengths from 512 bits to 4096 bits.
                                    The TOE contains modular exponentiation functions, which, together with other functions
                                    in the TOE, perform the operations required for RSA encryption or decryption. Two
                                    different RSA algorithms are supported by the TOE, namely the "Simple Straight Forward
                                    Method" (called RSA "straight forward", the key consists of the pair n and d) and RSA
                                    using the "Chinese Remainder Theorem" (RSA CRT, the key consists of the quintuple p,
                                    q, dp, dq, qInv).
                                    Attack resistance for this security functionality is discussed in Security architectural
                                    information.
                                    This security functionality covers:
                                    â¢ FCS_COP.1/RSA

                         7.1.1.2    SS.RSA_Pad

                                    The TOE provides functions that implement the RSA algorithm and the RSA-CRT
                                    algorithm for message and signature encoding. This IT security functionality supports the
                                    EME-OAEP and EMSA-PSS signature scheme. All algorithms are defined in PKCS #1,
                                    v2.2 (EME-OAEP, EMSA-PSS)

   o   Polymorphic Inspection Systems examine the polymorphic eMRTD
       document presented by the polymorphic eMRTD document holder to
       verify its authenticity by means of the physical security measures and
       to detect any manipulation of the physical part of the polymorphic
       eMRTD document.
    o Polymorphic Inspection Systems include the Country Signing CA Public
       Key and implement the respective terminal part of the protocols
       required to execute PACE with PIN, Passive Authentication (PA), CAv1,
       TAv1 authentication according to [TR-03110-2] and Polymorphic
       Authentication (PMA). They are assumed to securely store static IS
       private keys and generate secure temporary session keys and nonces.
    o The Document Verifier authorizes Polymorphic Inspection Systems by
       creation of Inspection System Certificates for access to polymorphic
       user data stored the polymorphic eMRTD document. An Polymorphic
       Inspection Systems authenticates itselve to the polymorphic eMRTD
       document's chip for getting access to the polymorphic data with its
       private Terminal Authentication key and corresponding Inspection
       System Certificate.
Application Note:
This Assumption is an extension of the Assumption 'A.Insp_Sys' defined in
[EAC-PP-V2]. For the EAC functionality of the TOE the assumption is necessary
because it covers the pre-requisite for performing the PACE with PIN, CAv1
and TAv1 authentication.

4 Security Objectives

This chapter describes the security objectives for the TOE and the security
objectives for the TOE environment. The security objectives for the TOE
environment are separated into security objectives for the development and
production environment and security objectives for the operational environment.

OE.AA_MRTD
      Active Authentication - Inspection Systems5
      An Active Authentication (Basic, General or Extended) Inspection system
      performs all the functions of the Basic, General and Extended Inspection
      System, and verifies the IC authenticity with an RSA or ECDSA signature
      generated by the MRTD (if available).



OE.Prot_Logical_Travel_Document
  Protection of data from the logical travel document
  The inspection system of the receiving State or Organisation ensures the
  confidentiality and integrity of the data read from the logical travel document.
  The inspection system will prevent eavesdropping to their communication with
  the TOE before secure messaging is successfully established based on the Chip
  Authentication Protocol Version 1.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP]in order to handle the Assumption
  A.Insp_Sys by requiring the Inspection System to perform secure messaging
  based on the Chip Authentication Protocol v.1.

OE.Ext_Insp_Systems
  Authorization of Extended Inspection Systems
  The Document Verifier of receiving States or Organisations authorizes
  Extended Inspection Systems by creation of Inspection System Certificates for
  access to sensitive biometric reference data of the logical travel document.
  The Extended Inspection System authenticates themselves to the travel
  documentâs chip for access to the sensitive biometric reference data with its
  private Terminal Authentication Key and its Inspection System Certificate.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Read_Sensitive_Data, the Organisational Security Policy P.Sensitive_Data
  and the Assumption A. Auth_PKI as it specifies the pre-requisite for the
  Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 as it concerns the responsibilities of the
  Document Verifier and the Inspection Systems.

4.3 Security Objectives Rationale

4.3.1 Threats

4.3.1.1 Threats listed in PP PACE

T.Skimming addresses accessing the User Data (stored on the TOE or
  transferred between the TOE and the terminal) using the TOE's
  contactless/contact interface. This threat is countered by the security
  objectives        OT.Data_Integrity,        OT.Data_Authenticity        and
  OT.Data_Confidentiality through the PACE authentication. The objective
  OE.Travel_Document_Holder ensures that a PACE session can only be
  established either by the travel document holder itself or by an authorised
  person or device, and, hence, cannot be captured by an attacker.

T.Eavesdropping addresses listening to the communication between the TOE
  and a rightful terminal in order to gain the User Data transferred there. This
  threat is countered by the security objective OT.Data_Confidentiality through a
  trusted channel based on the PACE authentication.

T.Tracing addresses gathering TOE tracing data identifying it remotely by
  establishing or listening to a communication via the contactless/contact
  interface of the TOE, whereby the attacker does not a priori know the correct
  values of the PACE password. This threat is directly countered by security
  objectives    OT.Tracing   (no    gathering   TOE     tracing    data)   and
  OE.Travel_Document_Holder (the attacker does not a priori know the correct
  values of the shared passwords).

T.Forgery 'Forgery of data' addresses the fraudulent, complete or partial
  alteration of the User Data or/and TSF-data stored on the TOE or/and
  exchanged between the TOE and the terminal. Additionally to the security
  objectives from PACE PP [PACE-PP] which counter this threat, the examination
  of     the     presented   MRTD       passport    book       according    to
  OE.Exam_Travel_Document 'Examination of the physical part of the travel
  document' shall ensure its authenticity by means of the physical security
  measures and detect any manipulation of the physical part of the travel
  document.
  The threat T.Forgery also addresses the fraudulent, complete or partial
  alteration of the User Data or/and TSF-data stored on the TOE or/and
                        Security Target Lite
                                                                    Ref.:
                 IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy
                                                              2018_2000036361
                 Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic
                                                                Page: 64/150
                       eMRTD Configuration)

  exchanged between the TOE and the terminal. The security objective
  OT.AC_Pers requires the TOE to limit the write access for the travel document
  to the trustworthy Personalisation Agent (cf. OE.Personalisation). The TOE will
  protect the integrity and authenticity of the stored and exchanged User Data
  or/and TSF-data as aimed by the security objectives OT.Data_Integrity and
  OT.Data_Authenticity, respectively. The objectives OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper and
  OT.Prot_Abuse-Func contribute to protecting integrity of the User Data or/and
  TSF-data stored on the TOE. A terminal operator operating his terminals
  according to OE.Terminal and performing the Passive Authentication using the
  Document Security Object as aimed by OE.Passive_Auth_Sign will be able to
  effectively verify integrity and authenticity of the data received from the TOE.

T.Abuse-Func addresses attacks of misusing TOE's functionality to manipulate
  or to disclosure the stored User- or TSF-data as well as to disable or to bypass
  the soft-coded security functionality. The security objective OT.Prot_Abuse-
  Func ensures that the usage of functions having not to be used in the
  operational phase is effectively prevented.

T.Information_Leakage is typical for integrated circuits like smart cards under
  direct attack with high attack potential. The protection of the TOE against this
  threat is obviously addressed by the directly related security objective
  OT.Prot_Inf_Leak.

T.Phys-Tamper is typical for integrated circuits like smart cards under direct
  attack with high attack potential. The protection of the TOE against this threat
  is obviously addressed by the directly related security objective OT.Prot_Phys-
  Tamper.

T.Malfunction is typical for integrated circuits like smart cards under direct
  attack with high attack potential. The protection of the TOE against this threat
  is obviously addressed by the directly related security objective
  OT.Prot_Malfunction.

4.3.1.2 Additional Threats

T.Read_Sensitive_Data The threat T.Read_Sensitive_Data 'Read the sensitive
  biometric    reference   data'    is  countered     by    the   TOE-objective
  OT.Sens_Data_Conf 'Confidentiality of sensitive biometric reference data'
  requiring that read access to EF.DG3 and EF.DG4 (containing the sensitive
  biometric reference data) is only granted to authorized inspection systems.
  Furthermore it is required that the transmission of these data ensures the
  data's confidentiality. The authorization bases on Document Verifier
  certificates issued by the issuing State or Organisation as required by
  OE.Authoriz_Sens_Data 'Authorization for use of sensitive biometric reference
  data'. The Document Verifier of the receiving State has to authorize Extended
  Inspection Systems by creating appropriate Inspection System certificates for

                       eMRTD Configuration)

  access to the sensitive biometric reference data as demanded                by
  OE.Ext_Insp_Systems 'Authorization of Extended Inspection Systems'.

T.Counterfeit 'Counterfeit of travel document chip data' addresses the attack of
  unauthorized copy or reproduction of the genuine travel document's chip. This
  attack is thwarted by chip an identification and authenticity proof required by
  OT.Chip_Auth_Proof 'Proof of travel document's chip authentication' using an
  authentication key pair to be generated by the issuing State or Organisation.
  The Public Chip Authentication Key has to be written into EF.DG14 and signed
  by    means     of  Documents       Security    Objects    as   demanded     by
  OE.Auth_Key_Travel_Document 'Travel document Authentication Key'.
  According to OE.Exam_Travel_Document 'Examination of the physical part of
  the travel document' the General Inspection system has to perform the Chip
  Authentication Protocol Version 1 to verify the authenticity of the travel
  document's chip. Moreover, the Active Authentication Public Key has to be
  written into EF.DG15 as demanded by OE.Auth_Key_MRTD 'MRTD
  Authentication Key'. According to OE.AA_MRTD 'Active Authentication -
  Inspection Systems' the Inspection system has to perform the Active
  Authentication Protocol to verify the authenticity of the MRTDâs chip.




4.3.1.3 Threats related to Polymorphic eMRTD

T.Sensitive_Polymorphic_Data The threat T.Sensitive_Polymorphic_Data
  is countered by the following TOE-objectives:
      o OT.Polymorphic_Data_Confidentiality requiring the confidentiality
         of the static sensitive polymorphic eMRTD PI, PP and CPI user data
         stored inside the TOE. Furthermore the confidentiality of the eMRTD
         polymorphic the randomized PI, PP and optional CPI User Data during
         their exchange is also required.
      o OT.Polymorphic_Data_Authenticity requiring the authenticity of the
         polymorphic eMRTD randomized PI, PP and optional CPI user data
         during their exchange between the TOE and Terminal/Authentication
         Service.
      o OT.Polymorphic_Data_Privacy requiring the privacy of the PI, PP
         and optional CPI user data during th polymorphic authentication
         process steps, including during the randomisation performed by the
         TOE as part of the PMA protocol.
      o OE.Authoriz_Polymorphic_Data requiring the authorization for the
         use of Polymorphic eMRTD user data based on CVCA/DV/IS certificates

4.3.2 Organisational Security Policies

4.3.2.1 OSP listed in PP PACE

P.Manufact requires a unique identification of the IC by means of the
  Initialization Data and the writing of the Pre-personalisation Data as being
  fulfilled by OT.Identification.

P.Pre-Operational is enforced by the following security objectives:
  OT.Identification is affine to the OSP's property 'traceability before the
  operational phase; OT.AC_Pers and OE.Personalisation together enforce the
  OSP's properties 'correctness of the User and the TSF-data stored' and
  'authorisation of Personalisation Agents'; OE.Legislative_Compliance is affine
  to the OSP's property 'compliance with laws and regulations'.

P.Card_PKI is enforced by establishing the issuing PKI branch as aimed by the
  objectives OE.Passive_Auth_Sign (for the Document Security Object).

P.Trustworthy_PKI is enforced by OE.Passive_Auth_Sign (for CSCA, issuing
  PKI branch).

P.Terminal 'Abilities and trustworthiness of terminals' is countered by the
  security objective OE.Exam_Travel_Document additionally to the security
  objectives from PACE PP [PACE-PP]. OE.Exam_Travel_Document enforces the
  terminals to perform the terminal part of the PACE protocol.
  The OSP P.Terminal is obviously enforced by the objective OE.Terminal,
  whereby the one-to-one mapping between the related properties is applicable.



4.3.2.2 Additional OSPs from PP EAC

P.Sensitive_Data 'Privacy of sensitive biometric reference data' is fulfilled and
  the threat T.Read_Sensitive_Data 'Read the sensitive biometric reference data'
  is countered by the TOE-objective OT.Sens_Data_Conf 'Confidentiality of
  sensitive biometric reference data' requiring that read access to EF.DG3 and
  EF.DG4 (containing the sensitive biometric reference data) is only granted to
  authorized inspection systems. Furthermore it is required that the
  transmission of these data ensures the data's confidentiality. The authorization
  bases on Document Verifier certificates issued by the issuing State or
  Organisation as required by OE.Authoriz_Sens_Data 'Authorization for use of
  sensitive biometric reference data'. The Document Verifier of the receiving
  State has to authorize Extended Inspection Systems by creating appropriate
  Inspection System certificates for access to the sensitive biometric reference
  data as demanded by OE.Ext_Insp_Systems 'Authorization of Extended
  Inspection Systems'.

P.Personalisation 'Personalisation of the travel document by issuing State or
  Organisation only' addresses the (i) the enrolment of the logical travel
  document by the Personalisation Agent as described in the security objective
  for the TOE environment OE.Personalisation 'Personalisation of logical travel
  document', and (ii) the access control for the user data and TSF data as
  described by the security objective OT.AC_Pers 'Access Control for
  Personalisation of logical travel document'. Note the manufacturer equips the
  TOE with the Personalisation Agent Key(s) according to OT.Identification
  'Identification and Authentication of the TOE'. The security objective
  OT.AC_Pers limits the management of TSF data and the management of TSF
  to the Personalisation Agent.

5 Extended Requirements


5.1 Definition of the Family FAU_SAS
To describe the security functional requirements of the TOE, the family FAU_SAS
of the class FAU (Security Audit) is defined here. This family describes the
functional requirements for the storage of audit data. It has a more general
approach than FAU_GEN, because it does not necessarily require the data to be
generated by the TOE itself and because it does not give specific details of the
content of the audit records.

The family âAudit data storage (FAU_SAS)â is specified as follows:

Family behavior:

This family defines functional requirements for the storage of audit data.

Component leveling:




FAU_SAS.1          Requires the TOE to provide the possibility to store audit data.

Management:        FAU_SAS.1
                   There are no management activities foreseen.

Audit:             FAU_SAS.1
                   There are no actions defined to be auditable.

FAU_SAS.1.1 The TSF shall provide [assignment: authorized users] with the
  capability to store [assignment: list of audit information] in the audit records.


5.2 Definition of the Family FCS_RND
To describe the IT security functional requirements of the TOE, the family
FCS_RND of the class FCS (Cryptographic support) is defined here. This family
describes the functional requirements for random number generation used for
cryptographic purposes. The component FCS_RND.1 is not limited to generation

of cryptographic keys unlike the component FCS_CKM.1. The similar component
FIA_SOS.2 is intended for non-cryptographic use.

The family âGeneration of random numbers (FCS_RND)â is specified as follows:

Family behavior:

This family defines quality requirements for the generation of random numbers
which are intended to be used for cryptographic purposes.

Component leveling:




FCS_RND.1        Generation of random numbers requires that random
numbers meet a defined quality metric.

Management:        FCS_RND.1
                   There are no management activities foreseen.

Audit:             FCS_RND.1
                   There are no actions defined to be auditable.

FCS_RND.1 Quality Metric for Random Numbers


Hierarchical to:   No other components.

Dependencies:      No dependencies.

FCS_RND.1.1 The TSF shall provide a mechanism to generate random numbers
  that meet [assignment: a defined quality metric].


5.3 Definition of the Family FIA_API
To describe the IT security functional requirements of the TOE a sensitive family
(FIA_API) of the Class FIA (Identification and authentication) is defined here.
This family describes the functional requirements for the proof of the claimed
identity for the authentication verification by an external entity where the other
families of the class FIA address the verification of the identity of an external
entity.

The family âAuthentication Proof of Identity (FIA_API)â is specified as follows:

                          eMRTD Configuration)

Family behavior:

This family defines functions provided by the TOE to prove their identity and to
be verified by an external entity in the TOE IT environment.

Component levelling:

Management:                FIA_API.1

         The following actions could be considered for the management functions in
         FMT: Management of authentication information used to prove the claimed
         identity.

Audit:                     There are no actions defined to be auditable.

Hierarchical to:     No other components.

Dependencies:        No dependencies.

FIA_API.1.1 The TSF shall provide a [assignment: authentication mechanism]
  to prove the identity of the [assignment: authorized user or role].


5.4 Definition of the Family FMT_LIM
The family FMT_LIM describes the functional requirements for the test features of
the TOE. The new functional requirements were defined in the class FMT because
this class addresses the management of functions of the TSF. The examples of
the technical mechanism used in the TOE show that no other class is appropriate
to address the specific issues of preventing abuse of functions by limiting the
capabilities of the functions and by limiting their availability.

The family âLimited capabilities and availability (FMT_LIM)â is specified as
follows:

Family behavior:

This family defines requirements that limit the capabilities and availability of
functions in a combined manner. Note that FDP_ACF restricts the access to
functions whereas the Limited capability of this family requires the functions
themselves to be designed in a specific manner.

                         eMRTD Configuration)


Component leveling:




FMT_LIM.1           Limited capabilities requires that the TSF is built to provide
only the capabilities (perform action, gather information) necessary for its
genuine purpose.

FMT_LIM.2           Limited availability requires that the TSF restrict the use of
functions (refer to Limited capabilities (FMT_LIM.1)). This can be achieved, for
instance, by removing or by disabling functions in a specific phase of the TOEâs
lifecycle.

Management:         FMT_LIM.1, FMT_LIM.2
                    There are no management activities foreseen.

Audit:              FMT_LIM.1, FMT_LIM.2
                    There are no actions defined to be auditable.

5.5 Definition of the Family FPT_EMS
The family FPT_EMS (TOE Emanation) of the class FPT (Protection of the TSF) is
defined here to describe the IT security functional requirements of the TOE. The
TOE shall prevent attacks against secret data stored in and used by the TOE
where the attack is based on external observable physical phenomena of the
TOE. Examples of such attacks are evaluation of TOEâs electromagnetic radiation,
simple power analysis (SPA), differential power analysis (DPA), timing attacks,
etc. This family describes the functional requirements for the limitation of
intelligible emanations being not directly addressed by any other component of
CC part 2.
The family âTOE Emanation (FPT_EMS)â is specified as follows:

Family behavior:

This family defines requirements to mitigate intelligible emanations.

Component leveling:




FPT_EMS.1         TOE emanation has two constituents:
   FPT_EMS.1.1           Limit of Emissions requires to not emit intelligible
   emissions enabling access to TSF data or user data.
   FPT_EMS.1.2           Interface Emanation requires to not emit interface
   emanation enabling access to TSF data or user data.

Management:              FPT_EMS.1
                         There are no management activities foreseen.

6 Security Requirements

6.1 Security Functional Requirements
This section on security functional requirements for the TOE is divided into sub-
section following the main security functionality. Several SFRs of the PACE PP
[PACE-PP] are only listed in the EAC PP [EAC-PP-V2]. Therefore the descriptions
of these SFRs are taken directly from PACE PP into the Security target on hand

FTP_ITC.1/PACE Inter-TSF trusted channel


FTP_ITC.1.1/PACE The TSF shall provide a communication channel between
  itself and another trusted IT product that is logically distinct from other
  communication channels and provides assured identification of its end points
  and protection of the channel data from modification or disclosure.

FTP_ITC.1.2/PACE The TSF shall permit another trusted IT product to
  initiate communication via the trusted channel.

FTP_ITC.1.3/PACE [Editorially Refined] The TSF shall initiate enforce
  communication via the trusted channel for any data exchange between the
  TOE and the Terminal.
Application Note:

In FTP_ITC.1.3/PACE, the word âinitiateâ is changed to âenforceâ, as the TOE is a
passive device that can not initiate the communication. All the communication
are initiated by the Terminal, and the TOE enforce the trusted channel. This
refinement does not conflict with the strict conformance to PACE and EACv1 PPs.

1.3 TOE Overview
The Security Target (ST) defines the security objectives and requirements for a
contact or contactless based chip of machine readable travel documents (MRTD)
based on the requirements and recommendations of the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO), EU requirements for biometric European passport
(Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 and Commission Implementing Decision
6181) and Biometric European Resident Permit (REGULATION (EU) 2017/1954
and Commission Implementing Decision 6178). This product is intended to
enable verification of the authenticity of the travel document and to identify its
holder during a border control, using an inspection system. The verification
process is based on Extended Access Control with Password Authenticated
Connection Establishment (PACE) and optionally Active Authentication (AA).

The main features and their origin are the following:
ï· Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
   according to ICAO Technical Report âSupplemental Access Controlâ [ICAO-
   9303] part 11 and strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0068-V2 [PACE-PP] for
   protection of the communication between terminal and chip. The following
   PACE mapping modes are supported and covered by the TOE:
      o    Generic Mapping (PACE-GM)
      o    Integrated Mapping (PACE-IM)
      o    Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM), which combines PACE-GM
           with Chip Authentication into a single protocol.

ï·   Chip Authentication v1
    according to BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1], [TR-03110-3] and
    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    travel documentâs chip to the inspection system.
ï·   Terminal Authentication v1
    according to BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1], [TR-03110-3] and
    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    inspection system to travel documentâs chip and protects the confidentiality
    and integrity of the sensitive biometric reference data during their
    transmission from the TOE to the inspection system.

As a feature that can be optionally configured the TOE supports:
ï·   Active Authentication
    which according to [ICAO-9303] prevents copying the SOD and proves that it
    has been read from the authentic chip. It proves that the chip has not been
    substituted.


ï·   Polymorphic Authentication
    which according to [PCA-eMRTD] provides additional privacy by randomisation
    of returned Polymorphic Identities, Polymorphic Pseudonyms and
    Complementary Polymorphic ID attributes in combination with standard ICAO
    and EAC1 eMRTD protocols specified in ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] and BSI
    TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1] and [TR 03110-3].

The TOE may also be used as an ISO driving license, compliant to ISO/IEC 18013
or ISO/IEC TR 19446 supporting PACE, AA and CA, as both applications (MRTD
and IDL) share the same protocols and data structure organization. Therefore, in
the rest of the document, the word âMRTDâ MAY be understood either as a MRTD
in the sense of ICAO, or a driving license compliant to ISO/IEC 18013 or ISO/IEC
TR 19446 depending on the targeted usage envisioned by the issuer.

Application note
This TOE claims an assurance level EAL5 augmented with AVA_VAN.5 and
ALC_DVS.2. AVA_VAN.5 implies that the TOE is resistant to attacks performed by
an attacker possessing "High attack potential".
Not all key sizes specified in this security target have sufficient cryptographic
strength for satisfying the AVA_VAN.5 âhigh attack potentialâ. In order to be
protected against attackers with a "high attack potential", sufficiently large
cryptographic key sizes SHALL be configured for this TOE. References can be
found in national and international document standards. Further details have
been specified in the TOEâs guidance documentation [AGD_PRE].

[TR-03110] have also been refered to in ISO18013 for EU driving licences. The
BAP-1 protocol defined in ISO18013 is equal to Basic Access Protocol (BAC)
defined in [ICAO-9303]. As to the logical data structure, the ISO18013 uses the
same concept of Passive Authentication defined in [ICAO-9303], but specifies
different ISO7816-4 elementary file identifiers for storing the ICAO defined
content of DG3, DG4 and DG15.

When an Issuing state is using the product as an ISO compliant Driving licence,

  FIA_UAU.1/PACE (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM, FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE
  CAM) using FCS_CKM.1/DH_PACE resp. FCS_CKM.1/CA and possessing the

  FMT_SMF.1 and FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related.

OT.Tracing The security objective OT.Tracing aims that the TOE prevents
  gathering TOE tracing data by means of unambiguous identifying the travel
  document remotely through establishing or listening to a communication via
  the contactless/contact-based interface of the TOE without a priori knowledge
  of the correct values of shared passwords (CAN, MRZ, PIN, PUK). This
  objective is achieved as follows:
            1. While establishing PACE communication with CAN, MRZ or PUK
                (non-blocking      authentication /   authorization  data)   by
                FIA_AFL.1/PACE,
            2. while establishing PACE communication using the PIN (blocking
                authentication data) by FIA_AFL.1/Block_PIN,
            3. for listening to PACE communication and for establishing CAv1
                communication by FTP_ITC.1/PACE,
            4. and      for     listening     to  CAv1     communication     by
                FTP_ITC.1/Polymorphic. The trusted channel shall be established
                by performing the PACE, CAv1 and TAv1 protocols according to
                [TR03110TR-03110] and the Polymorphic Authentication protocol
                (PMA).

OT.Prot_Abuse-Func The security objective OT.Prot_Abuse-Func âProtection
  against Abuse of Functionalityâ is ensured by the SFRs FMT_LIM.1, FMT_LIM.2,
  FMT_LIM.1/POLY and FMT_LIM.2/POLY which prevent misuse of test
  functionality of the TOE or other features which may not be used after TOE
  Delivery.

OT.Prot_Inf_Leak The security objective OT.Prot_Inf_Leak âProtection against
  Information Leakageâ requires the TOE to protect confidential TSF data stored
  and/or processed in the travel documentâs chip against disclosure
      by measurement and analysis of the shape and amplitude of signals or the
        time between events found by measuring signals on the electromagnetic
        field, power consumption, clock, or I/O lines which is addressed by the
        SFR FPT_EMS.1,
      by forcing a malfunction of the TOE which is addressed by the SFR
        FPT_FLS.1 and FPT_TST.1, and/or
      by a physical manipulation of the TOE which is addressed by the SFR
        FPT_PHP.3.

OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper The security objective OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper âProtection
  against Physical Tamperingâ is covered by the SFR FPT_PHP.3.

OT.Prot_Malfunction The security objective OT.Prot_Malfunction âProtection
  against Malfunctionsâ is covered by (i) the SFR FPT_TST.1 which requires self-
  tests to demonstrate the correct operation and tests of authorized users to
  verify the integrity of TSF data and TSF code, and (ii) the SFRFPT_FLS.1 which
  requires a secure state in case of detected failure or operating conditions
  possibly causing a malfunction.

OT.Identification The security objective OT.Identification âIdentification of the
  TOEâ addresses the storage of Initialisation and Pre-Personalisation Data in its
  non-volatile memory, whereby they also include the IC Identification Data
  uniquely identifying the TOEâs chip. This will be ensured by TSF according to
  SFR FAU_SAS.1. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA allows only the Manufacturer
  to write Initialisation and Pre-personalisation Data (including the
  Personalisation Agent key set). The SFR FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS requires the
  Personalisation Agent to disable access to Initialisation and Pre-personalisation
  Data in the life cycle phase âoperational useâ. The SFRs FMT_SMF.1 and
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related.

OT.AC_Pers The       security   objective  OT.AC_Pers      âAccess   Control   for
  Personalisation of logical travel documentâ addresses the access control of the
  writing the logical travel document. The justification for the SFRs FAU_SAS.1,
  FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA and FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS arises from the justification for
  OT.Identification above with respect to the Pre-personalisation Data. The write
  access to the logical travel document data are defined by the SFR
  FIA_UID.1/PACE (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM), FIA_UAU.1/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM), FDP_ACC.1/TRM and FDP_ACF.1/TRM
  in the same way: only the successfully authenticated Personalisation Agent is
  allowed to write the data of the groups EF.DG1 to EF.DG16 of the logical travel
  document only once. FMT_MTD.1/PA covers the related property of
  OT.AC_Pers (writing SOD and, in generally, personalization data). The SFR
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE lists the roles (including Personalisation Agent) and the SFR
  FMT_SMF.1 lists the TSF management functions (including Personalisation).

  The SFRs FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ (FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ for
  PACE CAM protocol) and FPT_EMS.1 restrict the access to the Personalisation
  Agent Keys, the Chip Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication
  Private key. The authentication of the terminal as Personalisation Agent shall
  be performed by TSF according to SFRs FIA_UAU.4/PACE and FIA_UAU.5/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM and FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). If the
  Personalisation Terminal wants to authenticate itself to the TOE by means of
  the Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 (after Chip Authentication v.1) with
  the Personalisation Agent Keys, the TOE will use TSF according to the
  FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the challenge), FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the
  derivation of the new session keys after Chip Authentication v.1), and
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC (for the ENC_MAC_Mode secure
  messaging), FCS_COP.1/SIG_VER (as part of the Terminal Authentication
  Protocol v.1) and FIA_UAU.6/EAC (for the re-authentication). If the
  Personalisation Terminal wants to authenticate itself to the TOE by means of
  the Authentication Mechanism with the Personalisation Agent Key, the TOE will
  use TSF according to the FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the challenge) and
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC (to verify the authentication attempt). The session keys
  are destroyed according to FCS_CKM.4 after use.

OT.Sens_Data_Conf The            security     objective      OT.Sense_Data_Confâ
  Confidentiality of sensitive biometric reference dataâ is enforced by the Access
  Control SFP defined in FDP_ACC.1/TRM and FDP_ACF.1/TRM allowing the data
  of EF.DG3 and EF.DG4 only to be read by successfully authenticated Extended
  Inspection System being authorized by a valid certificate according
  FCS_COP.1/SIG_VER. The SFRs FIA_UID.1/PACE and FIA_UAU.1/PACE
  (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM and FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) require the
  identification and authentication of the inspection systems. The SFR
  FIA_UAU.5/PACE requires the successful Chip Authentication (CA) v.1 before
  any     authentication    attempt   as    Extended     Inspection  System    (or
  FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). During the protected communication
  following the CA v.1 the reuse of authentication data is prevented by
  FIA_UAU.4/PACE (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). The SFR
  FIA_UAU.6/EAC and FDP_UCT.1/TRM requires the confidentiality protection of
  the transmitted data after Chip Authentication v.1 by means of secure
  messaging implemented by the cryptographic functions according to
  FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the terminal authentication challenge),
  FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the generation of shared secret and for the derivation of
  the new session keys), and FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC for
  the ENC_MAC_Mode secure messaging. The session keys are destroyed

OT.Chip_Auth_Proof The security objective OT.Chip_Auth_Proof âProof of
  travel documentâs chip authenticityâ is ensured by the Chip Authentication
  Protocolv.1 provided by FIA_API.1/CA and by Active Authentication provided
  by FIA_API.1/AA proving the identity of the TOE. The Chip Authentication
  Protocolv.1 defined by FCS_CKM.1/CA is performed using a TOE internally
  stored confidential private key as required by FMT_MTD.1/CAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ. The Chip Authentication Protocolv.1 [TR-03110-1]
  requires additional TSF according to FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the derivation of the
  session keys), FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC (for the
  ENC_MAC_Mode        secure    messaging).    The   SFRs     FMT_SMF.1     and
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related. The Active
  Authentication defined by FCS_COP.1/SIG_GEN for the generation of the RSA
  Signature is performed using a TOE internally stored confidential private key
  as required by FMT_MTD.1/AAPK and FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ. According to
  FDP_ACF.1, only the successfully authenticated Inspection Systems are
  allowed to request active authentication (FDP_ACF.1.2, rule 2).

 7.4.1.3       Flash Loader related Aspects
The justification related to the Flash Loader security objectives are as follows. Note that the following objectives
and related rationales apply only at TOE products coming with activated Flash Loader enabled for software or
data download by the user. In other cases the Flash Loader is not available anymore and the user data download
is completed. Depending on the capabilities of the user software these security functional requirements may
then reoccur as subject of the composite TOE.
The Flash Loader related objectives are:

The objective O.Authentication requires the presence of an authentication mechanism proving the identity of a
given security IC to an external entity. This objective is covered by the functional requirement FIA_API
Authentication Proof of Identity. The Flash Loader implements this functionality and outputs identification data
to external requesting entity. The user guidance describes in more detail how this authentication request is
applied and conducted by the external entity. As the functional requirements are met by the Flash Loader the
objective is covered.

The objective O.Cap_Avail_Loader requires limited capabilities of the Loader functionality and irreversible
termination of the Loader. First, this is covered by the functional requirement FMT_LIM.1/Loader which
implements protection against data manipulation and disclosure by unauthorized users after permanent
deactivation of the Flash Loader. Second, the functional requirement FMT_LIM.2/Loader limits the Flash Loader
availability after the download has been finished by the user. The Flash Loader provides a final locking command
which irreversibly terminates the Flash Loader availability. This command execution must be applied after user
has finalized his download. As the functional requirements are met by the Flash Loader the objective is covered.

The objectives O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader and O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality require that a trusted communication
channel with an authorized user, a confidentiality protection during the download and authentication of the user
data and access control for the usage of the Loader functionality are provided by the Loader.
Without successfully passing the authentication functionality of the Flash Loader no usage of the Flash Loader is
possible. Passing the authentication successfully assigns also a user role to the current user.
The Flash Loader implements mutual authentication functionality and if successfully passing this mutual
authentication, the TOE and the external user are established as trusted entities. Furthermore, the Flash Loader
enforces the exchange of the download key by the user which provides clear separation from the hardware
vendor and preserves confidentiality of the user data download. In addition, the Flash Loader preserves the
integrity of the downloaded data against for example induced errors by hashing functionality.
As the functional requirements are met by the Flash Loader the objective is covered.

Note regarding the Flash Loader:
The algorithm strength of the Flash Loader has not been cryptographic-analytically evaluated by the BSI, as
Infineon has implemented a proprietary extension.

Comment 1:
The dependency FMT_SMR.1 introduced by the two components FMT_MSA.1 and FMT_MSA.3 is considered to
be satisfied because the access control specified for the intended TOE is not role-based but enforced for each
subject. Therefore, there is no need to identify roles in form of a security functional requirement FMT_SMR.1.

These requirements all address the appropriate management of cryptographic keys used by the specified
cryptographic function and are not part of the PP [9]. Most requirements concerning key management shall be
fulfilled by the environment since the Smartcard Embedded Software is designed for a specific application
context and uses the cryptographic functions provided by the TOE.
For the security functional requirements:
   ï·      SCP:
              o FCS_COP.1/TDES and
              o FCS_COP.1/AES
     ï· SCL-1:
              o FCS_COP.1/TDES-SCL-1
              o FCS_COP.1/AES-SCL-1
              o FCS_COP.1/CMAC-SCL-1
     ï· SCL-2:
              o FCS_COP.1/TDES-SCL-2
              o FCS_COP.1/AES-SCL-2
the respective dependencies FCS_CKM.1, FDP_ITC.1 or FDP_ITC.2 have to be fulfilled by the environment,
because the TOE does not provide the accompanying functionality; i.e. generate and import keys.
That means that the environment shall meet the requirements FCS_CKM.1, FDP_ITC.1 or FDP_ITC.2 as defined
in Common Criteria Part 2 [11], section 10.1 and 11.7.
The cryptographic key destruction can be done by overwriting the key register interfaces or by software reset of
the SCP which provides immediate zeroing of all SCP key registers. Please refer also to the application notes 41
and 42 in the PP [9].

Publi and data to a privilege
level model. The MMU controls the address permissions of up to seven privileged levels and gives the software
the possibility to define different access rights for the user available privileged levels. The address permissions of
the privilege levels are controlled by the MMU. In case of an access violation the MMU will trigger a reset and
then a trap service routine can react on the access violation. The policy of setting up the MMU and specifying the
memory ranges for the privilege levels â with the exception of the IFX level â is defined from the user software
(OS). The privilege levels 0, 1 and 2 are reserved for TOE internal operations. The privilege levels 3 and 4 are
reserved for operation systems and the privilege levels 5, 6 and 7 are reserved for applications.
Therefore, the TOE provides support for secure separation of memory areas covering the security functional
requirements FPT_PHP.3 âResistance to physical attackâ, FDP_ACC.1 âSubset access controlâ, FDP_ACF.1
âSecurity attribute based access controlâ, FMT_MSA.1 âManagement of security attributesâ, FMT_MSA.3 âStatic
attribute initializationâ and FMT_SMF.1 âSpecification of Management functionsâ.

The TOE provides the possibility to protect the property rights of user code and data by the encryption of the
SOLID FLASHâ¢ NVM areas with a specific key defined by the user. Due to this key management FDP_ACF.1 is
fulfilled. In addition, each memory present on the TOE is encrypted using either mask specific or chip individual
or even session keys, assigned by a complex key management. Induced errors are recognized by the Integrity
Guard concept and lead to an alarm with high feasibility. In case of security critical errors a security alarm is
generated and the TOE ends up in a secure state. The covered security functional requirements are FPT_PHP.3

8.5            SF_CS: Cryptographic Support
The TOE is equipped with several hardware accelerators and software modules to support the standard
symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic operations. This security function is introduced to include the
cryptographic operation in the scope of the evaluation as the cryptographic function respectively mathematic
algorithm itself is not used from the TOE security policy. On the other hand these functions are of special interest
for the use of the hardware as platform for the software. The components are a cryptographic co-processor
supporting the DES and AES algorithms and a combination of a co-processor and software library modules to
support RSA cryptography, RSA key generation, ECDSA signature generation and verification, ECDH key
agreement and EC public key calculation and public key testing.
Note that the additional function of the EC library, ECC_ADD providing the primitive elliptic curve operations,
does not add specific security functionality and that the according user guidance abbreviates the Elliptic Curve
cryptographic functions with ECC.

Note 17:
The symmetric cryptographic library SCL in two alternative versions is a delivery option. Therefore the TOE may
come with or without one of the SCLs. In the case of coming without any of the alternative SCLs, the TOE does
not provide the related AES and TDES security functional requirements. The equal case applies if the symmetric
cryptographic coprocessor is blocked. Then neither the SCL versions nor the SCP implement the related AES and
TDES security functional requirements. The SCL requires the presence of the SCP.
End of note.

Note 18:
Not used. Kept for consistency.

Note 19:
The cryptographic libraries RSA, EC and the Toolbox library are delivery options, regardless of the version
chosen. Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations of or even without these libraries. In the case of
coming without one or any combination of the cryptographic libraries RSA and EC, the TOE does not provide the

Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or Elliptic Curve
Cryptography (EC). The Toolbox Library is no cryptographic library, provides no additional specific security
functionality and thus the Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
End of note.

Note 20:
This TOE can come with both crypto co-processors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked
Crypto2304T, or with both crypto co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior
to the production of the hardware. In case the SCP is blocked, no AES and DES computation supported by
hardware is possible. In case the Crypto2304T is blocked, no RSA and EC computation supported by hardware is
possible. No accessibility of the deselected cryptographic co-processors is without impact on any other security
policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the situation where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic
co-processors.
End of note.

Note 21:
The presence of the alternative cryptographic library CIPURSEâ¢ CL is a delivery option.
Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations with the other libraries of or without these libraries.
In the case of coming without the CIPURSEâ¢ CL the TOE does not provide the specific security functionality
implemented by this software.

1.     Executive Summary
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is an Infineon Security Controller M7893 B11 with optional
Software Library RSA2048/4096 v2.03.008, EC v2.03.008, SHA-2 v1.01, SCL v2.02.010
libraries, and Toolbox v2.03.008, as well as with specific IC dedicated software (firmware).
The TOE provides a real 16-bit CPU-architecture and is compatible to the 80251
microcontroller architecture. The major components of the core system are the two CPUs
(Central Processing Units), acting as one, the MMU (Memory Management Unit) and MED
(Memory Encryption/Decryption Unit). The dual interface controller is able to communicate
using either the contact based or the contactless interface.
The TOE consists of the hardware part, the firmware parts and the software parts.
The software parts are differentiated into the cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, and SHA-2,
symmetric cryptographic libraries and the supporting libraries Toolbox and Base. The Base
Library does not provide any specific security functionality on its own. However it is a
necessary perquisite in order to use the RSA, EC and Toolbox libraries.
This TOE is intended to be used in smart cards and other form factors for particularly
security-relevant applications and for its prevalent use as developing platform for smart
card operating systems. The term Smartcard Embedded Software is used in the following
for all operating systems and applications stored and executed on the TOE. The TOE is
the platform for the Smartcard Embedded Software.
The Security Target [6] is the basis for this certification. It is based on the certified
Protection Profile Security IC Platform Protection Profile, Version 1.0, 15 June 2007, BSI-
CC-PP-0035-2007 [8]. The TOE Security Functional Requirements are implemented by
the following TOE Security Functionality:

                                     The life cycle of the TOE is split up into several
                                     phases. Different operation modes help to protect
                                     the TOE during each phase of its lifecycle.
  SF_PS                              Protection against Snooping:
                                     The TOE uses various means to protect from
                                     snooping of memories and busses and prevents
                                     single stepping.

                                     modifying attacks of memories, alarm lines and
                                     sensors.

                                     The memory access control of the TOE uses a
                                     memory management unit (MMU) to control the
                                     access to the available physical memory by using
                                     virtual memory addresses and to segregate the
                                     code and data to a privilege level model. The
                                     MMU controls the address permissions of up
                                     seven privileged levels and gives the software the
                                     possibility to define different access rights. The
                                     address permissions of the privilege levels are

  SF_CS                                Cryptographic Support:
                                       The TOE is equipped with several hardware
                                       accelerators and software modules to support the
                                       standard      symmetric     and       asymmetric
                                       cryptographic operations. The components are a
                                       coprocessor supporting the DES and AES
                                       algorithms and a combination of a coprocessor
                                       and software modules to support RSA
                                       cryptography, RSA key generation, ECDSA
                                       signature generation and verification, ECDH key
                                       agreement and EC public key calculation and
                                       public key testing. Furthermore, the TOE is
                                       equipped with an optional SHA-2 library and
                                       HASH module as well as well as an AIS31
                                       conformant TRNG that meets the functionality
                                       class PTG.2. In addition the optional Symmetric
                                       library (SCL) provides a high-level interface to
                                       3DES and AES symmetric cryptographic
                                       operation implemented on the symmetric

                                     Table 2: Deliverables of the TOE

The delivery documentation describes all procedures that are necessary to maintain
security when distributing versions of the TOE or parts of it to the userâs site including the
necessary intermediate delivery procedures.
Furthermore, the delivery documentation describes in a sufficient manner how the various
procedures and technical measures provide for the detection of modifications and any
discrepancies between the TOE respective parts of it send by the TOE Manufacturer and
the version received by the Composite Product Manufacturer.
Three different delivery procedures have to be taken into consideration:
    â   Delivery of the IC dedicated software components (IC dedicated SW, guidance)
        from the TOE Manufacturer to the IC Embedded Software Developer.
    â   Delivery of the IC Embedded Software (ROM / Flash data, initialisation and pre-
        personalisation data) from the IC Embedded Software Developer to the TOE
        Manufacturer.
    â   Delivery of the final TOE from the TOE Manufacturer to the Composite Product
        Manufacturer. After phase 3 the TOE is delivered in form of wafers or sawn wafers,
        after phase 4 in form of modules (with or without inlay antenna).
Respective distribution centers are listed in Appendix B (see below).
The individual TOE hardware is uniquely identified by its identification data. The
identification data contains the lot number, the wafer number and the coordinates of the
chip on the wafer. Each individual TOE can therefore be traced unambiguously and thus
assigned to the entire development and production process.
The hardware part of the TOE is identified by M7893 B11. Another characteristic of the
TOE are the chip identification data. These chip identification data is accessible via the
Generic Chip Identification Mode (GCIM) see [16] chapter 7.10.3.
The firmware part of the TOE is also identified also via the GCIM for all of the firmware
parts.




                                                                                                    14 / 33
BSI-DSZ-CC-0879-V4-2020                                                       Certification Report




The SCL (optional), RSA (optional), EC (optional), SHA-2 (optional), Toolbox (optional),
and Base library (optional), as separate software parts of the TOE, are also identified by
their unique version numbers. The user can identify these versions by calculating the hash
signatures of the provided library files. The mapping of these hash signatures to the
version numbers is provided in the Security Target [6] and [9] section 10.
For further, detailed information regarding TOE identification see [9], section 1.2.
Please also note, that as the TOE is under control of the user software, the TOE
Manufacturer can only guarantee the integrity up to the delivery procedure. It is in the
responsibility of the Composite Product Manufacturer to include mechanisms in the
implemented software (developed by the IC Embedded Software Developer) which allows
detection of modifications after the delivery.

3.       Security Policy
The Security Policy is expressed by the set of Security Functional Requirements and
implemented by the TOE. It covers the following issues:
Symmetric cryptographic block cipher algorithms (Triple-DES and AES), to ensure the
confidentiality of plain text data by encryption and to support secure authentication
protocols and it will provide a random number generation of appropriate quality.
The RSA library is used to provide a high level interface to RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman)
cryptography implemented on the hardware component Crypto2304T and includes
countermeasures against SPA, DPA and DFA attacks. The EC library is used to provide a
high level interface to Elliptic Curve cryptography implemented on the hardware
component Crypto2304T and includes countermeasures against SPA, DPA and DFA
attacks. The SHA-library provides the calculation of a hash value of freely chosen data
input in the CPU.
As the TOE is a hardware security platform, the security policy of the TOE is also to
provide protection against leakage of information (e.g. to ensure the confidentiality of
cryptographic keys during AES, Triple-DES, RSA and EC cryptographic functions
performed by the TOE), against physical probing, against malfunctions, against physical
manipulations and against abuse of functionality.
Hence the TOE shall
     â   maintain the integrity and the confidentiality of data stored in the memory of the
         TOE and
     â   maintain the integrity, the correct operation and the confidentiality of security
         functionalities (security mechanisms and associated functions) provided by the
         TOE.

4.       Assumptions and Clarification of Scope
The Assumptions defined in the Security Target and some aspects of Threats and
Organisational Security Policies are not covered by the TOE itself. These aspects lead to
specific security objectives to be fulfilled by the TOE-Environment. The following topics are
of relevance: OE.Plat-Appl (Usage of Hardware Platform), OE.Resp-Appl (Treatment of
User Data) and OE.Process-Sec-IC (Protection during Composite product manufacturing).
Details can be found in the Security Target [6] and [9], chapter 5.2.

5.       Architectural Information
The TOE is an integrated circuit (IC) providing a platform for an operating sytem and
application software used in smartcards but also in any other device or form factor
requiring a high level of resistance against attackers. A top level block diagram and a list of
subsystems can be found within the TOE description of the Security Target [6], chapter
2.1.
The TOE consists of a core system, memories, computing peripherals, system peripherals,
standard peripherals, an analogue module and the connecting busses. The major
components of the core system are the double CPU (Central Processing Units) including
the internal encryption leaving no plain data, the MMU (Memory Management Unit) and
MED (Memory Encryption/Decryption Unit). The Block diagram provides a simplified
overview upon the hardware subsystems in the Security Target [6] and [9], figure 1.
The symmetric co-processor (SCP) combines both AES and Triple-DES with dual-key or
triple-key hardware acceleration. The Asymmetric Crypto Co-processor is called
Crypto2304T and provides hardware support for asymmetric algorithms like RSA and EC.
The software part of the TOE consists of the cryptographic RSA-, EC-, SCL- and the SHA-
2 libraries and the supporting Toolbox and Base libraries. If RSA or EC or Toolbox or
combinations hereof are part of the shipment, automatically the Base Library of the same
version is included.

6.       Documentation
The evaluated documentation as outlined in table 2 is being provided with the product to
the customer. This documentation contains the required information for secure usage of
the TOE in accordance with the Security Target.
Additional obligations and notes for secure usage of the TOE as outlined in chapter 10 of
this report have to be followed.

7.       IT Product Testing
The developer performed five categories of tests:
     â   Simulation Tests (design verification): The simulation tests are carried out in the
         course of the development of the TOE during the IC design phase. They verify that
         the designed circuits satisfy the specifications.
     â   Qualification Tests: For each mask version a qualification test is performed. Via the
         results of these tests a qualification report is generated. The positive result of the
         qualification is one part of the necessary testing results documented with the
         qualification report. The qualification report is completed after the verification testing
         (see below) and the security evaluation (see below) are performed successfully.
         The tests performed and their results are listed in the qualification report. The
         results of the tests are the basis on which it is decided, whether the TOE is released
         to production.
     â   Verification Tests: With these tests in user mode the functionality of the end user
         environment is checked.
     â   Security Evaluation Tests: In the context of security evaluation testing the security
         mechanisms is tested again in the user mode only focusing on security. Here is not



                                                                                             16 / 33
BSI-DSZ-CC-0879-V4-2020                                                       Certification Report




         only verified that the security functionality is working as this was already tested on
         every single TOE during production, but also it is tested how well the security
         functionality is working and the effectiveness is calculated. This step is necessary
         as the mechanisms work together and that must be evaluated in the user mode.
     â   Production Tests: Before delivery on every chip production tests are performed.
         These tests use the CRC checksums attained by the simulation tests. The aim of
         these tests is to check whether each chip is functioning correctly.
The developer tests cover all security functionalities and all security mechanisms as
identified in the functional specification.
The evaluators were able to repeat the tests of the developer either using the library of
programs, tools and prepared chip samples delivered to the evaluator or at the developers
site. They performed independent tests to supplement, augment and to verify the tests
performed by the developer. The tests of the developer were repeated by sampling, by
repetition of complete regression tests and by software routines developed by the
evaluators and computed on samples with an evaluation operating system. For the
developer tests repeated by the evaluators other test parameters were used and the test
equipment was varied. Security features of the TOE realised by specific design and layout
measures were checked by the evaluators during layout inspections both in design data
and on the final product.
The evaluation has shown that the actual version of the TOE provides the security
functionalities as specified by the developer. The test results confirm the correct
implementation of the TOE security functionalities.
For penetration testing the evaluators took all security functionalities into consideration.
Intensive penetration testing was planned based on the analysis results and performed for
the underlying mechanisms of security functionalities using bespoke equipment and expert
know how. The penetration tests considered both the physical tampering of the TOE and
attacks which do not modify the TOE physically. The penetration tests results confirm that
the TOE is resistant to attackers with high attack potential in the intended environment for
the TOE.

8.       Evaluated Configuration
This certification covers the following configurations of the TOE:
     â   Smartcard IC M7893 B11.
Depending on the blocking configuration, a M7893 product can have a different user
available configuration as described in Security Target Lite [6], chapter 1.1. The M7893
B11 allows for a maximum of configuration possibilities defined by the customer order
following the market needs. For example, a M7893 B11 product can come in one project
with the fully available ROM and SOLID FLASHâ¢ Non Volatile Memory (NVM) or in
another project without any user available ROM and with any other SOLID FLASHâ¢ NVM-
size below the physical implementation size, or with a different RAM size. Even more, the
user has the free choice, whether he needs the symmetric co-processor SCP, or the
asymmetric co-processor Crypto2304T, or both, or none of them. In addition, the user
decides, whether the TOE comes with a combination of software libraries or without any.
And, to be even more flexible, various interface options can be chosen as well.

9.        Results of the Evaluation
9.1.       CC specific results
The Evaluation Technical Report (ETR) [7] was provided by the ITSEF according to the
Common Criteria [1], the Methodology [2], the requirements of the Scheme [3] and all
interpretations and guidelines of the Scheme (AIS) [4] as relevant for the TOE.
The Evaluation Methodology CEM [2] was used for those components up to EAL 5
extended by advice of the Certification Body for components beyond EAL 5 and guidance
specific for the technology of the product [4] (AIS 34).
The following guidance specific for the technology was used:
(i)        The Application of CC to Integrated Circuits,
(ii)       The Application of Attack Potential to Smartcards,
(iii)      Functionality classes and evaluation methodology of physical random number
           generators,
(see [4] e.g., AIS 25, AIS 26 and AIS 31).
For RNG assessment the scheme interpretations AIS xx was used (see [4]).
To support composite evaluations according to AIS 36 the document ETR for composite
evaluation [10] was provided and approved. This document provides details of this
platform evaluation that have to be considered in the course of a composite evaluation on
top.
The assurance r keys that
                             are imported and/or derived from other keys. This implies that appropriate key
                             management has to be implemented in the environment. In addition, the treatment of
                             User Data comprises the implementation of a multi-application operating system that
                             does not disclose security relevant User Data of one application to another one. These
                             measures make sure that the assumption A.Key-Function is still covered by the
                             security objective OE.Resp-Appl although additional functions are being supported
                             according to P.Add-Components.
                       The justification related to the assumption "Check of initialisation data by the Security IC
                       Embedded Software (A.Check-Init)" is as follows:
                       Since OE.Check-Init requires the Security IC Embedded Software developer to implement
                       a function assumed in A.Check-Init, the assumption is covered by the objective.
                       The justification of the additional policy and the additional assumptions show that they do
                       not contradict to the rationale already given in the PP [6] for the assumptions, policy and
                       threats defined there.

5. Extended Components Definition
                       This Security Target does not define extended components.
                       Note that the PP âSecurity IC Protection Profileâ [6] defines extended security functional
                       requirements in chapter 5, which are included in this Security Target.
                       The extended component definition used for Random Number Generator has been taken
                       from [8].

6. Security Requirements
                       This part of the Security Target defines the detailed security requirements that shall be
                       satisfied by the TOE. The statement of TOE security requirements shall define the
                       functional and assurance security requirements that the TOE needs to satisfy in order to
                       meet the security objectives for the TOE. This chapter consists of the sections âSecurity
                       Functional Requirementsâ, âSecurity Assurance Requirementsâ and âSecurity
                       Requirements Rationaleâ.
                       The CC allows several operations to be performed on security requirements (on the
                       component level); refinement, selection, assignment, and iteration are defined in
                       paragraph 8.1 of Part 1 of the CC [1]. These operations are used in the PP [6] and in this
                       Security Target, respectively.
                       The refinement operation is used to add details to requirements, and, thus, further
                       restricts a requirement. Refinements of security requirements are denoted in such a way
                       that added words are in bold text and changed words are crossed out.
                       The selection operation is used to select one or more options provided by the PP [6] or
                       CC in stating a requirement. Selections having been made are denoted as italic text.
                       The assignment operation is used to assign a specific value to an unspecified
                       parameter, such as the length of a password. Assignments having been made are
                       denoted by showing as italic text.
                       The iteration operation is used when a component is repeated with varying operations. It
                       is denoted by showing brackets â[iteration indicator]â and the iteration indicator within the
                       brackets.
                       For the sake of a better readability, the iteration operation may also be applied to some
                       single components (being not repeated) in order to indicate belonging of such SFRs to
                       same functional cluster. In such a case, the iteration operation is applied to only one
                       single component.
                       Whenever an element in the PP [6] contains an operation that the PP author left
                       uncompleted, the ST author has to complete that operation.

                 6.1 Security Functional Requirements
                       The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) of the TOE are presented in the following
                       sections to support a better understanding of the combination of PP âSecurity IC
                       Protection Profileâ [6] and Security Target.
                  6.1.1 SFRs of the Protection Profile
                       Table 21 below shows all SFRs, which are specified in the PP [6] (in the order of definition
                       in the PP). Some of the SFRs are CC Part 2 extended and defined in the PP [6]. This is
                       shown in the third column of the table.

                       The operations for all SFR except for the SFR FAU_SAS.1 and FCS_RNG.1 are already

                       In addition, for FCS_RNG.1.2 the PP [6] partially fills in the assignment operation for the

8.5.6          CIPURSEâ¢ Cryptographic Library
The order option CIPURSEâ¢ Cryptographic Library (CCL) provides cryptographic functionality to implement a
CIPURSEâ¢ V2 conformant protocol [35-1].
This protocol provides a secure mutual authentication of two entities, namely the terminal (denoted as PCD =
Proximity Coupling Device (CIPURSEâ¢-compliant terminal)) and a smart card or a token in other form factors
which is called PICC. PICC stands for Proximity Integrated Circuit Card (CIPURSEâ¢-compliant card).
Beside the mutual authentication, the protocol implements cryptographic measures to maintain the integrity of
the transferred data and preserves in parallel the confidentiality of the transferred data.

The CIPURSEâ¢ CL covers the following cryptographic security functional requirements as follows:
CCL in version v02.00.0004
   ï· FCS_CKM.1/CCLCryptographic key generation,
   ï· FCS_CKM.4/CCLCryptographic key destruction â AES
   ï· FCS_COP.1/CCLCryptographic Operation â CCL Trusted Channel

                     The implemented cryptographic operation applies following standards:
    ï·   Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 197 [31]
    ï·   NIST Special Publication SP 800-38A [21]

8.5.7          Hybrid PTRNG
Random data is essential for cryptography as well as for security mechanisms. The TOE is equipped with a Hybrid
Physical True Random Number Generator (HPTRNG, FCS_RNG.1). The random data can be used from the
Smartcard Embedded Software and is also used from the security features of the TOE, i.e. masking. The
HPTRNG implements various topological means, masked bus interface and is self-checking.
The produced genuine random numbers are available as a security service for the user and are also used for
internal purposes. Together with the security guidelines in [6] the hybrid PTRNG operates in the following modes
of operation and is conformant to the named classes:
    ï· True Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.2
    ï· Hybrid Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.3
    ï· Deterministic Random Number Generation (DRNG) AIS31 DRG.3
    ï· Key Stream Generation (KSG), stream cipher generation AIS31 DRG.2

The details of AIS31 are given in [13].

The Hybrid PTRNG implements protected a protected peripheral bus interface is a synthesized module and
covers therefore FPT_PHP.3 âResistance to physical attackâ. The transferred random data are masked as well as
other configuration data transferred over the peripheral bus. This covers FDP_ITT.1 âBasic internal transfer
protectionâ and FPT_ITT.1 âBasic internal TSF data transfer protectionâ. The correct function of the Hybrid
PTRNG is subject of internal self-testing and in case of errors a secure state is achieved to protect the user from
random data with bad entropy. Therefore, the output of the Hybrid PTRNG is conformant to the above claimed
classes or there is no random data output. This covers FPT_FLS.1 âFailure with preservation of secure stateâ.

  7             Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)

  7.1           TOE Security Functional Requirements
 The security functional requirements (SFR) for this TOE are defined in this chapter.
This ST covers the three PPs [PP_SAC], [PP_EAC] and [PP_BAC] each two of which have a non empty
intersection of SFRs. In the rest of this section we provide a classification of the SFRs of these PPs depending on
where these SFRs are declared and if they need a refinement here in this ST.
 Table 1 lists all SFRs appearing both in [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC].
 Table 2 lists all SFRs declared in [PP_SAC].
Table 3 lists all SFRs specific to [PP_BAC]. Note that some of the SFRs appear in both [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC]
with same name but different content. In such cases the SFR is iterated with either the extension â¦/BAC or
â¦/PACE.
Table 4 lists all SFRs specific to [PP_EAC]. Note that [PP_EAC] is an extension of [PP_SAC], therefore all SFRs of
[PP_SAC] are SFRs in [PP_EAC], i.e. the SFRs listed in Table 3 and Table 4 are also SFRs of [PP_EAC].
Table 5 lists the SFRs introduced in this ST which are related to the Active Authentication mechanism
supported by the TOE.

7.1.1                About the Application Notes in this ST
Note that if an SFR has application notes as per the PPs [PP_SAC], [PP_EAC] and [PP_BAC] then these
application notes apply and can be found in the respective PPs.
Some SFRs contain additional application notes to ease the understanding of the specificities of this TOE.
These application notes do not come from the PPs and are prefixed with [IFX specific].

 Application Note:         notes. While the application note from [PP_BAC] simply requests the encryption
                           and message authentication keys to be destroyed, the application note from
                           [PP_SAC] provides more detailed requests, when the session keys have to be
                           destroyed. Therefore FCS_CKM.4 from [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC] can be combined.

                          from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be combined, i.e. the random numbers shall be
                          used for the PACE, BAC and the authentication mechanism based on Triple-DES (as
                          defined in FIA_UAU.4/PACE and FIA_UAU.4).

 [IFX specific]           The application note 42 of [PP_BAC] applies. This application note provides a
 Application Note:        definition, what is meant by âPre-Personalisation Dataâ. This definition is also
                          applicable to FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA from [PP_SAC]. Therefore FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA

                          correct operation of the TSF.

 FPT_TST.1.2              The TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to verify the integrity of

 [IFX specific]           There is no contradiction between application note 46 of [PP_BAC] and application
                          note 52 of [PP_SAC]. In fact, although the wording is slightly different, the meaning
 Application Note:
                          of these application notes is identical. Therefore either of these application notes
                          applies and FPT_TST.1 from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be combined.

 FPT_PHP.3.1              The TSF shall resist physical manipulation and physical probing to the TSF by
                          responding automatically such that the SFRs are always enforced.

 [IFX specific]           Application note 47 of [PP_BAC] and 53 of [PP_SAC] are equivalent. Application
                          note 48 of [PP_BAC] is only informative to the reader in the sense, that it provides a

                          FPT_PHP.3. Therefore either application note 47 of [PP_BAC] or application note 53
                          of [PP_SAC] applies and FPT_PHP.3 from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be combined.

                          Table 8. The availability of minor configuration options partly depends on the selected major
                          configuration option. However, in general the minor configuration options can be chosen
                          independently.
                1.4.2.3     Post Delivery Configuration
                          Post Delivery Configuration (PDC) can be applied by the customer himself after the TOE
                          has been delivered to that customer. These options can be used to tailor the TOE to the
                          specific customer requirements. The Post Delivery Configuration can be changed multiple
                          times but must be set permanently by the customer before the TOE is delivered to phase 7
                          of the life cycle.
                          The Post Delivery Configuration for the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF is listed in Table
                          9.

                          By applying Post Delivery Configuration the Security Rows content is updated for the
                          changed configuration options and can therefore be used for identification of the TOE after
                          applying any Post Delivery Configuration. Further details regarding Security Rows content
                          and identification of the TOE after applying Post Delivery Configuration refer to [9].
                          The Post Delivery Configuration can be accessed using chip health mode functionality in
                          combination with the ISO/IEC 7816 contact interface.

                          A number of package types are supported for each major configuration of the TOE. The
                          commercial types are named according to the following format.

                          the variables rr and ff. Variable y identifies the activation of the firmware emulations.
                          Variable o identifies the EEPROM size of MIFARE Software. The number 9 is used as Fab
                          identifier and B/F references to the silicon version also available at major configuration
                          naming as VB/VF. The variables are replaced according to the rules in Table 10.

                                                                    type and the package type inside the inlay.)


                       For example, commercial type name P60D024PX0/9Brrff denotes major configuration
                       P60D024yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF in PDM1.1 dual interface smart card module. The characters ârrâ
                       and âffâ are individual for each customer product.
                       The package types do not influence the security functionality of the TOE. They only define
                       which pads are connected in the package and for what purpose and in which environment
                       the chip can be used. Note that the security of the TOE is not dependent on which pad is
                       connected or not - the connections just define how the product can be used. If the TOE is
                       delivered as wafer the customer can choose the connections on his own.
                       Security during development and production is ensured for all package types listed above,
                       for details refer to section 1.4.4.
                       The commercial type name identifies major configuration and package type of the TOE as
                       well as the Security IC Embedded Software. However, the commercial type name does not
                       itemize the minor configuration options of the TOE, which are introduced in section 1.4.2.2.
                       Instead, minor configuration options are identified in the Order Entry Form, which is
                       assigned to the ROM code number and the FabKey number of the commercial type name.

                  1.4.3 Logical Scope of TOE
                1.4.3.1     Hardware Description
                          The CPU of the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF supports a 32-/24-/16-/8-bit instruction
                          set and distinguishes five CPU modes, which are summarized in Table 12.

                          Table 12.    CPU modes of the TOE
                                            Super System Mode
                           Boot Mode            Test Mode                            Firmware Mode                     System Mode        User Mode

                          Boot Mode, Test Mode and Firmware Mode are sub-modes of the so-called Super System
                          Mode. These three modes are not available to the Security IC Embedded Software; they
                          are reserved for the Security IC Dedicated Software. The Security IC Dedicated Software is
                          composed of Security IC Dedicated Test Software and Security IC Dedicated Support
                          Software, (Boot-ROM Software and Firmware Operating System) as introduced in section
                          1.4.1. The three software components are mapped one-to-one to the three CPU modes: In
                          Boot Mode the TOE executes the Boot-ROM Software, in Test Mode the TOE executes the
                          IC Dedicated Test Software and in Firmware Mode the TOE executes the Firmware
                          Operating System. Please note that the Super System Mode is not a mode on its own:
                          When the TOE is in Super System Mode, it is always either in Boot Mode, Test Mode or
                          Firmware Mode.
                          The P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF is able to control two different logical phases. After
                          production of the Security IC every start-up or reset completes with Test Mode and
                          execution of the IC Dedicated Test Software. The Test Mode is disabled at the end of the
                          production test. Afterwards, every start-up or reset ends up in System Mode and execution
                          of the Security IC Embedded Software.
                          In case the minor configuration option âPost Delivery Configurationâ is enabled and not finally
                          locked by the customer, the resource configuration functionality allows the customer to
                          enable or disable specific functionality of the hardware platform, refer to Table 9.
                          In case the minor configuration option âChip Health/Ident Modeâ is enabled, during the boot
                          process routines either starting built-in self tests checking the functional integrity of the TOE
                          or sending back identification items of the TOE can be activated by the user.
                          System Mode and User Mode are available to the developer of the Security IC Embedded
                          Software. System Mode has unlimited access to the hardware components available to the
                          Security IC Embedded Software. User Mode has restricted access to the CPU, specific
                          Special Function Registers and the memories depending on the access rights granted by
                          software running in System Mode. The hardware components are controlled by the Security
                          IC Embedded Software via Special Function Registers. Special Function Registers are
                          interrelated to the activities of the CPU, the Memory Management Unit, interrupt control, I/O
                          configuration, EEPROM, timers, UART, the contactless interface and the coprocessors.

                       The P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF provides two types of interrupts: (i) exception
                       interrupts, called âexceptionâ in the following and (ii) event interrupts, called âinterruptsâ in
                       the following. Exceptions and interrupts each force a jump to a specific fixed vector address
                       in the ROM. Any exception and interrupt can therefore be controlled and guided by a specific
                       part     of     the    Security     IC     Embedded       Software.      In     addition,    the
                       P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF provides eight firmware vectors (FVEC) and 32 system
                       call vectors (SVEC). These vectors have to be explicitly called by the Security IC Embedded
                       Software. A jump to a firmware vector forces Firmware Mode and starts execution of the
                       Firmware Operating System, a jump to a system call vector forces System Mode.
                       The Watchdog timer is intended to abort irregular program executions by a time-out
                       mechanism and is enabled and configured by the Security IC Embedded Software.
                       The P60D024yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF incorporates 352 kBytes of ROM, 8.125 kBytes of RAM and

and against download of malicious software before, during and after the user downloads his software. This is
formalized with the objectives O.Cap_Avail_Loader, O.Authentication and O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader requiring
authentication of the TOE to external entities and a trusted communication channel. The O.Authentication
implements a mutual authentication and involves the environment therefore.
And the policies cover also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must be
regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.
The implemented mutual authentication requires first to authenticate the TOE to the external user. This requires
also knowledge by the user about the sequence of the protocol, interpretation of the transferred data and how to
start the authentication of the TOE. This authentication mean counters the threat T.Masquerade_TOE as only
the genuine TOE is able to identify itself correctly to the enabled user, which covers O.Authentication.
The second step of the mutual authentications mean implements the authentication of the user to the TOE. Only
the user enabled to present the correct authentication data and knowing about the sequence, data
interpretation and signaling of the authentication to the TOE is able to proceed further on.
This enforces OE.TOE_Auth, requiring the support of the verification mechanism and known authentication
reference data by the operational environment.

It is normal business that products enabled for software download by the user are either on their way to the user
or are already stored at user premises. At both situations it cannot be excluded that an attacker could manage to
steal such products enabled for software downloads. The ability to download software on a chip without
operating system and/or application is defined as open sample.
This situation generates the threat T.Open_Samples_Diffusion which is defined as follows:
The download of analysis software could enable an attacker to characterize the product and to construct an
attack path out of the gained information.
This threat is countered by the Flash Loader by following rational:
As long as the Flash Loader is active, controlled usage to the Flash Loader functionality (P.Ctrl_Loader) is
enforced which protects the TOE from achieving the status of being an open sample. And more, even the
attacker could observe, meaning in the sense of measurements during, or induce faults during an authorized
download, the Flash Loader protects the user data of the download by confidentiality and integrity protection
means. The Flash Loader functionalities of mutual authentication, establishing a dedicated trusted
communication channel, the encryption and integrity protection means cover the objectives
O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality, O.Leak-Inherent and O.Leak-Forced.
The policy P.Ctrl_Loader covers also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1
