         of an EEPROM block such that the integrity of the data read from EEPROM is ensured
                      even if the characteristics of the EEPROM changed e.g. due to ageing. Therefore,
                      FDP_SDI.2[HW] and FDP_SDI.2[FW] are suitable to meet the security objective.
                      The justification related to the security objective “Post Delivery Configuration of
                      Hardware” (O.CUST_RECONF_PLAIN) is as follows:
                      The security functional requirement “Specification of Management Functions
                      (FMT_SMF.1)” is used for the specification of the management functions to be
                      provided by the P6022y VB as demanded by O.CUST_RECONF_PLAIN. Therefore,
                      FMT_SMF.1[HW] is suitable to meet the security objective.
                      The justification related to the security objective "Sealing/Unsealing user data” (O.PUF) is
                      as follows:
                      The security functional requirement FCS_CKM.1[PUF] requires the generation of
                      cryptographic key from the key derivation function based on the PUF block and the
                      Random Number Generator (RNG). Since the PUF block and the Random Number
                      Generator provide a TOE specific data to the key derivation function, the user data which
                      is encrypted with this cryptographic key can be decrypted with the same TOE that the
                      user data was encrypted on. The security functional requirement FCS_CKM.4[PUF]
                      requires that the cryptographic keys which are derived by the key derivation function are
                      destroyed by the method of flushing of key registers. The SFR FCS_COP.1[PUF_AES]
                      defines the encryption and decryption of the user data using cryptographic algorithm
                      AES. The SFR FCS_COP.1[PUF_MAC] defines the calculation of a MAC as a PUF

               6.3.3 Rationale for the Security Assurance Requirements


              6.3.3.1   NXP Secure Smart Card Controller P6022y VB
                        The selection of assurance components is based on the underlying PP [6]. The Security
                        Target for the P6022y VB uses the same augmentations as the PP, but chooses a higher
                        assurance level. The level EAL6 is chosen in order to meet assurance expectations of
                        digital signature applications and electronic payment systems.
                        The rationale for the augmentations is the same as in the PP. The assurance level EAL6
                        is an elaborated pre-defined level of the CC, part 3 [3]. The assurance components in an
                        EAL level are chosen in a way that they build a mutually supportive and complete set of
                        components. The requirements chosen for augmentation do not add any dependencies,
                        which are not already fulfilled for the corresponding requirements contained in EAL6,
                        respectively. Therefore, these components add additional assurance to EAL6, but the
                        mutual support of the requirements is still guaranteed.
                        As stated in the Section 6.3.3 of the PP [6], it has to be assumed that attackers with high
                        attack potential try to attack smartcards used for digital signature applications or payment
                        systems. Therefore specifically AVA_VAN.5 was chosen by the PP [6] in order to assure
                        that even these attackers cannot successfully attack the P6022y VB.

               6.3.4 Security Requirements are Internally Consistent


              6.3.4.1   NXP Secure Smart Card Controller P6022y VB
                        The discussion of security functional requirements and assurance requirements in the
                        preceding sections has shown that mutual support and consistency are given for both
                        groups of requirements. The arguments given for the fact that the assurance components
                        are adequate for the functionality of the P6022y VB also show that the security functional
                        requirements and assurance requirements support each other and that there are no
                        inconsistencies between these groups.
                        The security functional requirements FDP_SDC.1 and FDP_SDI.2 address the
                        protection of user data in the specified memory areas against compromise and
                        manipulation. The security functional requirements required to meet the security
                        objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing, O.Malfunction, O.Phys-Manipulation and
                        O.Leak-Forced also protect the cryptographic algorithms, the integrity support of data
                        stored in EEPROM and the memory access/separation control function as well as the
                        access control to Special Function Register implemented according to the security
                        functional requirement FCS_COP.1[TDES], FCS_CKM.4[TDES], FCS_COP.1[AES],
                        FCS_CKM.4[AES], FDP_SDI.2[HW], FDP_SDI.2[FW], FDP_SDI.2[EEPROM],
                        FDP_SDI.2[RAM], FDP_SDI.2[ROM], FDP_SDC.1[EEPROM], FDP_SDC.1[RAM], and
                        FDP_ACC.1[MEM], FDP_ACC.1[SFR] with reference to the Access Control Policies
                        defined in FDP_ACF.1[MEM] and FDP_ACF.1[SFR]. Therefore, these security functional
                        requirements support the secure implementation and operation of FCS_COP.1[TDES],
                        FCS_CKM.4[TDES], FCS_COP.1[AES], FCS_CKM.4[AES] and of FDP_ACC.1 with
                        FDP_ACF.1 as well as the dependent security functional requirements.
                        A hardware platform including the IC Dedicated Software requires Security IC Embedded
                        Software to build a secure product. Thereby the Security IC Embedded Software must
                        support the security functionality of the hardware as well as the IC Dedicated Support
                        Software and implement a sufficient management of the security services implemented
                        by the hardware platform including the IC Dedicated Software. The realisation of the
                        Security Functional Requirements within the P6022y VB provides a good balance
                        between flexible configuration and restrictions to ensure a secure behaviour of the
                        P6022y VB.

7       TOE Summary Specification
                        This chapter is composed of sections “Portions of the TOE Security Functionality” and
                        “TOE Summary Specification Rationale”.


                 7.1 Portions of the TOE Security Functionality
                        The TOE Security Functionality (TSF) directly corresponds to the TOE security functional
                        requirements defined in Section 6. The Security Functionality provided by the TOE
                        P6022y VB is split into Security Services (SS) and Security Features (SF). Both are
                        active and applicable to phases 4 to 7 of the Security IC product life-cycle.
                        Note: Parts of the security functionality are configured at the end of phase 3 and all
                        security functionality is active after phase 3 or phase 4 depending on the delivery form.
                        The TOE also comprises security mechanisms, which are not listed as security
                        functionality in the following. Such mechanisms do not implement a complete Security
                        Services or Security Features. They can be used to implement further Security Services
                        and/or Security Features based on Security IC Embedded Software using these security
                        mechanisms, e.g. the Fame2 coprocessor for asymmetric cryptographic algorithms.


               7.1.1 Security Services of the TOE

              7.1.1.1   NXP Secure Smart Card Controller P6022y VB
                        SS.RNG: Random Number Generator
                        The Random Number Generator continuously produces random numbers with a
                        length of one byte. The P6022y VB implements SS.RNG by means of a physical
                        hardware Random Number Generator working stable within the valid ranges of operating
                        conditions, which are guaranteed by SF.OPC.
                        The TSF provides a hardware test functionality, which can be used by the Security
                        IC Embedded Software to hardware detects or bad quality of the produced random
                        numbers.
                        According to AIS31 [7] the Random Number Generator claims the functionality class
                        PTG2. This means that the Random Number Generator is suitable for generation of
                        signature key pairs, generation of session keys for symmetric encryption mechanisms,
                        random padding bits, zero-knowledge proofs, the generation of seeds for DRNGs and
                        fulfils the online test requirements defined in [7].
                        SS.TDES: Triple-DES coprocessor
                        The P6022y VB provides the Triple Data Encryption Standard (Triple-DES) according
                        to the Data Encryption Standard (DES) [23]. SS.TDES is a modular basic cryptographic
                        function, which provides the Triple-DES algorithm as defined by NIST SP 800-67 [23]
                        by means of a hardware coprocessor and supports (a) the 3-key Triple-DES algorithm
                        according to keying option 1 and (b) the 2-key Triple-DES algorithm according to keying
                        option 2 in NIST SP 800-67 [23]. The two/three 56-bit keys (112-/168-bit) for the 2-key/3-
                        key Triple-DES algorithm shall be provided by the Security IC Embedded Software.
                        SS.TDES also supports hardware XOR-operation of two data blocks to support chaining
                        modes of the encryption of Triple-DES if this is configured by the Security IC Embedded

                        Software. Note that the hardware support for the CBC mode of SS.TDES is limited to
                        encryption.
                        SS.AES: AES coprocessor
                        The P6022y VB provides the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm according
                        to the Advanced Encryption Standard as defined by FIPS PUB 197 [20]. SS.AES is a
                        modular basic cryptographic function, which provides the AES algorithm by means of a
                        hardware coprocessor and supports the AES algorithm with three different key lengths of
                        128, 192 or 256 bit. The keys for the AES algorithm shall be provided by the Security IC
                        Embedded Software.
                        SS.AES also supports hardware XOR-operation of two data blocks to support chaining
                        modes of the encryption of AES if this is configured by the Security IC Embedded
                        Software. Note that the hardware support for the CBC mode of SS.AES is limited to
                        encryption.
                        SS.RECONFIG: Post Delivery Configuration
                        SS.RECONFIG realizes the Post Delivery Configuration. The Hardware Post Delivery
                        Configuration can be used by the customer to set the accessible size of the EEPROM
                        and CXRAM and to enable or disable the Fame2 coprocessor, the AES coprocessor
                        and the contactless interface. The configuration values of the Hardware Post Delivery
                        Configuration options are stored in a special area in the Security Row (see SF.COMP).
                        Note that if the Fame2 coprocessor and the AES coprocessor are disabled, both will no
                        longer be available to the Security IC Embedded Software and attempting to use it will
                        raise an exception. This means the availability of SS.AES is configurable.
                        The customer can change the values of Hardware Post Delivery Configuration through
                        invoking the Hardware Post Delivery Configuration functionality in Firmware Operating
                        System (see SF.MEM_ACC). This functionality is invoked by using the FVEC interface
                        (FVEC0.15).
                        The customer can change these values as many times as he wishes. However, once he
                        calls this Firmware Operating System using FVEC0.15 with a certain parameter set to a
                        specific value, the options are locked permanently, and can no longer be changed. The
                        options must be locked before the P6022y VB is delivered to the customer before phase
                        7 of the Security IC product life-cycle.


               7.1.2 Security Features
                        In this section, the security features of the TOE P6022y VB are described.


              7.1.2.1   NXP Secure Smart Card Controller P6022y VB
                        SF.OPC: Control of Operating Conditions
                        SF.OPC ensures correct operation of the P6022y VB (functions offered by the
                        microcontroller including the standard CPU as well as the Triple-DES coprocessor, AES
                        coprocessor, the arithmetic coprocessor, the memories, registers, I/O interfaces and the
                        other system peripherals) during execution of the IC Dedicated Support Software and
                        Security IC Embedded Software. This includes all security mechanisms of the P6022y
                        VB, which directly contribute to a Security Service or a Security Feature.
                        The P6022y VB ensures its correct operation and prevents any malfunction using the
                        following mechanisms: filtering of power supply, clock frequency and reset input as well
                        as monitoring of voltage supply, clock frequency input and the temperature of the chip

                      by means of sensors. There are multiple voltage and frequency sensors for the different
                      ISO/IEC 7816 voltage classes and the contactless operation mode. Light sensors are
                      distributed over the chip surface and used to detect light attacks. In addition to the light
                      sensors the EEPROM provides two functions to detect light attacks. The Security IC
                      Embedded Software can enable/disable the EEPROM double read function.
                      Specific functional units of the P6022y VB are equipped with further fault injection
                      detection. This comprises the Secure Fetch for the processing of code and data by the
                      CPU or special circuitry within a functional unit. The functional units are the Program
                      Counter, the stack pointer, the CPU control register, the MMU address cache and control
                      registers, the SBC interface for the Triple-DES and the AES coprocessors, the Fame2
                      coprocessor, Copy Machine control registers and hardware configuration as well as test
                      control registers. Furthermore the P6022y VB contains a watchdog timer which can be
                      enabled and configured by the Security IC Embedded Software to protect the program
                      execution.
                      If one of the monitored parameters is out of the specified range, either (i) a reset is forced
                      and the actually running program is aborted or (ii) an exception is raised which interrupts
                      the program flow and allows a reaction of the Security IC Embedded Software. In case
                      minor configuration option “Inverse EEPROM Error Correction” is enabled (see Section
                      1.4.2.2) the probability to detect fault injection attack detectors at the EEPROM memory
                      and interface increases and the error correction logic raises an exception when detecting
                      an error. The RAM memory is equipped with additional parity bits which are checked
                      when the corresponding data stored in RAM is read. Additionally a RAM parity watchdog
                      mechanism is supported which checks the parity bits of the complete RAM in random
                      order when the Security IC Embedded Software is not accessing the RAM. In case of
                      detected RAM parity attack detectors both mechanisms trigger a security reset. In case
                      the P6022y VB processes a reset all components of the P6022y VB are initialised with
                      their reset values and the P6022y VB provides a reset cause indicator to the Security IC
                      Embedded Software. In the case an exception is raised an indicator for the reason of the
                      exception is provided. The P6022y VB defends the sensors from being disabled by the
                      Security IC Embedded Software.
                      The P6022y VB controls the specified range of the stack pointer. The stack pointer and
                      the related control logic are implemented threefold for the User Mode, System Mode
                      and Super System Mode (comprising Boot Mode, Test Mode and Firmware Mode). An
                      exception is generated in case the specified limits are exceeded.
                      In addition, SF.OPC comprises a sensor, which checks the high voltage of the write
                      process to the EEPROM during each write sequence. The result of this sensor must
                      be read from a Special Function Register and does not force an automatic event (e.g.
                      exception).
                      SF.PHY: Protection against Physical Manipulation
                      SF.PHY protects the P6022y VB against manipulation of (i) the IC hardware, (ii) the
                      IC Dedicated Software in ROM, (iii) the Security IC Embedded Software in ROM and
                      EEPROM, (iv) the Application Data in EEPROM and RAM including TSF data in the
                      Security Rows. It also protects User Data and TSF data against disclosure by physical
                      probing when stored or while being processed by the P6022y VB.
                      The protection of the P6022y VB comprises several security mechanisms in design and
                      construction, which make reverse-engineering and tamper attacks more difficult. These
                      mechanisms comprise dedicated shielding techniques for the P6022y VB and specific
                      encryption- and check mechanisms for the memories and internal buses. SF.PHY
                      supports the efficiency of other portions of the security functionality.

                      SF.PHY also supports the integrity of the EEPROM, RAM and the ROM. The EEPROM
                      is able to correct a 1-bit error within each byte. The EEPROM corrects these attack
                      detectors automatically without user interaction. The RAM and the ROM provide a parity
                      check. In both cases a reset is forced based on a parity error.
                      The CRC coprocessor is used in Boot Mode by the IC dedicated Software for calculation
                      of a CRC checksum for integrity protection of TSF data.
                      SF.PUF: User Data Protection using PUF
                      SF.PUF implements a mechanism to seal/unseal the user data stored in shared
                      memory against unintended disclosure. SF.PUF encrypts/decrypts the user data with
                      a cryptographic key derived from the PUF data. SF.PUF calculates a MAC as a PUF
                      authentication value. SF.PUF provides this sealing/unsealing mechanism through the
                      specified interfaces FVEC2 (see Fig. 2) only.
                      SF.LOG: Logical Protection
                      SF.LOG implements security mechanisms to limit or eliminate the information in the
                      shape and amplitude of signals or in the time between events, which might be found by
                      measuring such signals. This comprises the power supply, signals on other pads, which
                      are not intentionally used for communication by the terminal or the Security IC Embedded
                      Software as well as emanation of the hardware platform. Thereby SF.LOG prevents from
                      disclosure of User Data and TSF data stored and/or processed in the Security IC through
                      measurement of power consumption or emanation and subsequent complex signal
                      analysis. This protection of the P6022y VB is enforced by several security mechanisms in
                      the design, which support these portions of security functionality.
                      The Triple-DES coprocessor includes specific security mechanisms to prevent SPA/
                      DPA analysis of shape and amplitude of the power consumption and emanation. The
                      implementation of the Triple-DES coprocessor further ensures that the calculation time is
                      independent from the chosen key value and plain/cipher text.
                      The AES coprocessor includes specific security mechanisms to prevent SPA/DPA
                      analysis of shape and amplitude of the power consumption and emanation. The
                      implementation of the AES coprocessor further ensures that the calculation time is
                      independent from the chosen key any plain/cipher text for a given key length.
                      The Fame2 coprocessor provides measures to prevent timing attacks on basic modular
                      function. The calculation time of an operation depends on the lengths of the operands,
                      but not on the value of the operands, with the following exceptions: multiplication with
                      reduction, modular inversion and modular division. These three operations have no
                      constant timing due to correction cycles that are needed based on the calculation
                      method. In addition, mechanisms are included, which provide limitations of the capability
                      for the analysis of shape and amplitude of the power consumption. Of course the Fame2
                      coprocessor does not realise an algorithm on its own and algorithm-specific leakage
                      countermeasures have to be added by the Security IC Embedded Software when using
                      the Fame2 coprocessor.
                      Additional security mechanisms can be configured by the Security IC Embedded
                      Software. This comprises the configuration of the clock that can be used to prevent the
                      synchronisation between internal operations and external clock or characteristics of the
                      power consumption that can be used as trigger signal to support leakage attacks (DPA or
                      timing attacks)
                      Some mechanisms described for SF.PHY (e.g. the encryption mechanisms) and for
                      SF.OPC (e.g. the filter mechanisms) support SF.LOG.

                      SF.COMP provides control of the CPU mode for (i) Boot Mode, (ii) Test Mode and
                      (iii) Firmware Mode. This includes protection of electronic fuses stored in a protected
                      memory area, the so-called Security Rows, and the possibility to store initialisation or
                      pre-personalisation data in the so-called FabKey Area.
                      Control of the CPU mode for Boot Mode, Test Mode and Firmware Mode prevents abuse
                      of test functions after TOE delivery. It also inhibits abuse of features, which are used
                      during start-up or reset to configure the P6022y VB.
                      The integrity control of electronic fuses ensures secure storage and setup of
                      configuration and calibration data, during the start-up in Boot Mode. The protection
                      of electronic fuses especially ensures that configuration options with regard to the
                      security functionality cannot be changed, abused or influenced in any way. The transfer
                      of the content of the electronic fuses into the related hardware configuration registers
                      is protected by a CRC checksum generated using the CRC coprocessor. SF.COMP
                      ensures that activation or deactivation of security mechanisms cannot be influenced by
                      the Security IC Embedded Software so that the TSF provides self-protection against
                      interference and tampering by untrusted Security IC Embedded Software.
                      SF.COMP protects CPU mode switches regarding Boot Mode, Test Mode and Firmware
                      Mode in the following way: Switching from Boot Mode to Test Mode or Firmware Mode is
                      allowed, switching from these modes back to Boot Mode is prevented. Switching to Test
                      Mode is prevented as well after TOE delivery, because Test Mode then is permanently
                      disabled. SF.COMP also ensures that Boot Mode is active only in the boot phase during
                      start-up or reset of the P6022y VB, and cannot be invoked afterwards. Therefore, once
                      the P6022y VB has left the test phase and each time the P6022y VB completed start-up
                      or reset, Firmware Mode is the only Super System Mode available.
                      The TSF controls access to the Security Rows, the top-most 512 Bytes of the EEPROM
                      memory, accessible at reserved addresses in the memory map. The available EEPROM
                      memory space for the Security IC Embedded Software is reduced by this area.
                      SF.COMP provides three memory areas in the Security Rows, which can be used by the
                      Security IC Embedded Software. These are
                      • the User Read Only Area
                      • the User Write Protected Area and
                      • the User Write Once Area.
                      The User Read Only Area contains 32 bytes, which are read-only for the Security IC
                      Embedded Software. The User Write Protected area contains 16 bytes, which can be
                      write-protected by the Security IC Embedded Software on demand. The User Write Once
                      Area contains 32 bytes of which each bit can separately be set to ‘1’ once only, and not
                      reset to ‘0’.
                      SF.COMP also provides a memory area in the Security Row where the current values
                      for the Post Delivery Configuration (see SS.RECONFIG). This area cannot be accessed
                      by the Security IC Embedded Software, but it can be accessed by the Resource
                      Configuration Firmware.
                      If minor configuration option “Card Disable” feature is used (refer to section 1.4.2.2)
                      SF.COMP inhibits any start-up of the Security IC Embedded Software once the Security
                      IC Embedded Software disables the card.
                      If minor configuration option “EEPROM application content erase” is used (see Section
                      1.4.2.2) SF.COMP erases the application data stored in the EEPROM once the Security
                      IC Embedded Software has activated this security feature.

                      SF.COMP also provides the FabKey Area where initialisation and identification data can
                      be stored. The FabKey area does not belong to the Security Rows and is not protected
                      by hardware mechanisms. The FabKey Area as well as the Security Rows can be used
                      by SF.COMP to store a unique identification for each die.
                      The complete EEPROM is initialized during wafer testing and pre-personalisation. The
                      values for the Security Row depend on the configuration options and choice of the
                      Security IC Embedded Software developer. The values for the application EEPROM
                      depend on the choice of the Security IC Embedded Software developer and are
                      included in the Order Entry Form. The User Write Protected Area and the User Write
                      Once Area are designed to store the identification of a (fully personalised) Security IC
                      (e.g. smartcard) or a sequence of events over the life-cycle, that can be coded by an
                      increasing number of bits set to "one" or protecting bytes, respectively.
                      SF.COMP limits the capabilities of the test functions and provides test personnel during
                      phase 3 with the capability to store identification and/or pre-personalisation data and/or
                      supplements of the Security IC Embedded Software in the EEPROM. SF.COMP provides
                      self-protection against interference and tampering by untrusted subjects both in the Test
                      Mode and in the other modes. It also enforces the separation of domains regarding the
                      IC Dedicated Software and the Security IC Embedded Software.
                      SF.MEM_ACC: Memory Access Control
                      SF.MEM_ACC controls access of any subject (program code comprising processor
                      instructions) to the memories of the P6022y VB through the Memory Management Unit.
                      Memory access is based on virtual addresses that are mapped to physical addresses.
                      The CPU always uses virtual addresses. The Memory Management Unit performs the
                      translation from virtual to physical addresses and the physical addresses are passed
                      from the Memory Management Unit to the memory interfaces to access the memories.
                      Access control is conducted in two ways:
                      • Memory partitioning: Each memory type ROM, RAM and EEPROM is partitioned into
                        two parts. In Boot Mode and Firmware Mode the CPU has access to the Firmware
                        EEPROM, Firmware RAM and Test-ROM. In System Mode and User Mode the CPU
                        has access to the Application EEPROM, Application RAM and Application ROM.
                        Access to both parts of each type is allowed in Test Mode for testing.
                      • Memory segmentation in User Mode: The three accessible parts of the memory in
                        ROM, RAM and EEPROM can be segmented into smaller memory areas. Access
                        rights (read/write or execute) can be defined for these segments. The operation read
                        and write are considered as one kind of operation, if one is allowed, so is the other.
                        However, in general the access to a segment can be denied.
                        In addition, access rights to Special Function Registers related to hardware
                        components can be defined for code executed in User Mode.
                      Memory partitioning is fixed and cannot be changed. It is determined during
                      production of the P6022y VB and is solely dependent on the major configuration (see
                      Section 1.4.2.1.1) and Post Delivery Configuration (see Section 1.4.2.3.1).
                      Memory segmentation can be defined in System Mode. The segmentation is active when
                      the CPU switches to User Mode. The segments, their access rights and the access
                      rights to Special Function Registers related to hardware components are defined in the
                      MMU Segment Table. The MMU Segment Table stores five values for each segment:
                      The memory access rights, the virtual start address of the segment, the virtual end
                      address of the segment, the address offset for the segment and the access rights to
                      Special Function Registers for code that is executed in the segment. The address offset
                      is used to relocate the segment anywhere in the memory map. The resulting address
                      computed by the Memory Management Unit can not overrule memory partitioning. Up

                      to 64 segments can be defined in the MMU Segment Table. Special configurations of
                      the memory access rights allow to specify less than 64 segments and to split the MMU
                      Segment Table into several parts being stored at different locations in memory.
                      Note that the MMU Segment Table itself is stored in the memory and therefore the table
                      itself can be placed in a segment accessible in User Mode.
                      In addition, SF.MEM_ACC permanently checks whether accessed addresses point to
                      physically implemented memory. Any access outside the boundaries of the physical
                      implemented memory in all CPU modes except the Test Mode and access to forbidden
                      memory addresses in User Mode are notified by raising an exception.
                      The Memory Management Unit also handles access rights to Special Function Registers
                      related to hardware components for code running in Firmware Mode. The configuration
                      of the access rights for User Mode and Firmware Mode are used by SF.SFR_ACC to
                      grant or block access to the related Special Function Registers. The access rights can
                      be defined for up to 16 groups of Special Function Registers, which are related to 16
                      hardware peripherals or memories described in [9], section 12.4. Thus, User Mode
                      and Firmware Mode can be restricted in their access to the Special Function Registers
                      related to hardware components on demand of the Security IC Embedded Software.
                      Note that SF.MEM_ACC only provides the access rights to SF.SFR_ACC, the access
                      control is enforced by SF.SFR_ACC.
                      SF.SFR_ACC: Special Function Register Access Control
                      SF.SFR_ACC controls access to the Special Function Registers and CPU mode
                      switches based on specific Special Function Register. SF.SFR_ACC implements access
                      control to the Special Function Registers as specified in the Access Control Policy and
                      the Security Functional Requirements FDP_ACC.1[SFR] and FDP_ACF.1[SFR].
                      The function of the Special Function Register and the CPU mode determine, whether
                      read and/or write access to a Special Function Register is allowed or not. Key registers
                      cannot be read since they are write-only to support the confidentiality of keys. Write
                      access is granted depending on the CPU mode. Similar for the output register of the
                      Random Number Generator, which is read-only based on its function, and read access is
                      granted based on the CPU mode.
                      SF.SFR_ACC controls accesses to Special Function Registers. If the access is not
                      allowed or the Special Function Register addressed by the code is not implemented an
                      exception is triggered. The Security IC Embedded Software can react on this exception.
                      Some Special Function Registers are implemented threefold, one for User Mode, a
                      second one for System Mode and a third one for Super System Mode meaning Boot
                      Mode, Test Mode and Firmware Mode. Hence, such Special Function Registers are
                      inherently separated and enforce the separation between the CPU modes.
                      SF.SFR_ACC relies on access rights to Special Function Registers related to hardware
                      components, which are provided by SF.MEM_ACC. Access rights to all other Special
                      Function Registers are pre-defined and cannot be configured by the code running on the
                      hardware platform.
                      This implies that code running in User Mode or Firmware Mode is not able to use
                      SS.RNG, SS.TDES, and SS.AES until access to the respective group of Special Function
                      Registers is explicitly granted by code running in System Mode. This holds for all 16
                      hardware components, which are controlled by the 16 groups of Special Function
                      Registers related to hardware components.
                      SF.SFR_ACC also implements transitions among CPU modes based on specific Special
                      Function Register.

                      The CPU mode changes by the following operations.
                      • Call of a system call vector (SVEC) address or a firmware vector (FVEC) address. A
                        call of a SVEC enables System Mode, a call of a FVEC sets enables Firmware Mode.
                        Calls of SVEC addresses are allowed in User Mode only, otherwise an exception is
                        raised.
                      • Execution of an exception or interrupt. Any event that leads to the execution of an
                        exception leads to a special status of the related CPU mode. Any further exception in
                        this special status forces a reset. Interrupts can be executed in User Mode or in System
                        Mode as well as in Firmware Mode. The Security IC Embedded Software running in
                        System Mode can configure this option at run time.
                      • Return from an exception/interrupt or vector call with a RETI instruction. This restores
                        the CPU mode before the event occurred. A RETI in User Mode is allowed only in case
                        interrupts are allowed to be executed in User Mode and an interrupt is actually active,
                        otherwise an exception is raised.
                      • Execution of an LCALL/ACALL/ECALL instruction to a specific address. A call of
                        address 0x800000 in System Mode enables User Mode and starts execution at this
                        (virtual) address. This is similar to a FVEC or SVEC call, but no return address is
                        pushed onto the stack.
                      • Direct modification of the specific Special Function Register. Hardware provided by
                        SF.SFR_ACC ensures that the bits can only be cleared. Therefore it is not possible
                        for code running in User Mode to enter System Mode, but System Mode can switch to
                        User Mode.
                      Two CPU modes are available to the Security IC Embedded Software, which are System
                      Mode and User Mode. System Mode is the more privileged CPU mode since it allows
                      access to all Special Function Registers related to hardware components and for system
                      management (i.e. configuration of Memory Management Unit, clock settings and some
                      mechanisms provided by SF.LOG). User Mode is the less privileged, but in regard to
                      hardware components it can be made as powerful as System Mode.
                      SF.SFR_ACC and SF.COMP together ensure that other CPU modes are not available
                      to the Security IC Embedded Software, but reserved for specific purposes fulfilled by the
                      IC Dedicated Software. As described above, SF.MEM_ACC provides the access control
                      information to Special Function Registers related to hardware components in Firmware
                      Mode and User Mode.
                      SF.FFW: Firmware Firewall
                      SF.FFW (Protected Firmware Mode) implements a mechanism to protect the application
                      data of the different firmware applications (NXP firmware functionality) running in
                      Firmware Mode by means of a firewall separating the application data between each
                      other. The firewall mechanism is based on the security features SF.MEM_ACC and
                      SF.SFR_ACC.
                      SF.FIRMWARE: Firmware Support
                      SF.FIRMWARE (Firmware Operating System) implements specific basic support
                      functionality for the Security IC Embedded Software. The basic support functionality is
                      implemented in a way that the protection and separation of the different type of User
                      Data is enforced. The security feature SF.FIRMWARE is based on the security features
                      SF.MEM_ACC, SF.SFR_ACC and SF.FFW.

1.3 TOE Overview
The Security Target (ST) defines the security objectives and requirements for a
contact or contactless based chip of machine readable travel documents (MRTD)
based on the requirements and recommendations of the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO), EU requirements for biometric European passport
(Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 and Commission Implementing Decision
6181) and Biometric European Resident Permit (REGULATION (EU) 2017/1954
and Commission Implementing Decision 6178). This product is intended to
enable verification of the authenticity of the travel document and to identify its
holder during a border control, using an inspection system. The verification
process is based on Extended Access Control with Password Authenticated
Connection Establishment (PACE) and optionally Active Authentication (AA).

The main features and their origin are the following:
 Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
   according to ICAO Technical Report “Supplemental Access Control” [ICAO-
   9303] part 11 and strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0068-V2 [PACE-PP] for
   protection of the communication between terminal and chip. The following
   PACE mapping modes are supported and covered by the TOE:
      o    Generic Mapping (PACE-GM)
      o    Integrated Mapping (PACE-IM)
      o    Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM), which combines PACE-GM
           with Chip Authentication into a single protocol.

   Chip Authentication v1
    according to BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1], [TR-03110-3] and
    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    travel document’s chip to the inspection system.
   Terminal Authentication v1
    according to BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1], [TR-03110-3] and
    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    inspection system to travel document’s chip and protects the confidentiality
    and integrity of the sensitive biometric reference data during their
    transmission from the TOE to the inspection system.

As a feature that can be optionally configured the TOE supports:
   Active Authentication
    which according to [ICAO-9303] prevents copying the SOD and proves that it
    has been read from the authentic chip. It proves that the chip has not been
    substituted.


   Polymorphic Authentication
    which according to [PCA-eMRTD] provides additional privacy by randomisation
    of returned Polymorphic Identities, Polymorphic Pseudonyms and
    Complementary Polymorphic ID attributes in combination with standard ICAO
    and EAC1 eMRTD protocols specified in ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] and BSI
    TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1] and [TR 03110-3].

The TOE may also be used as an ISO driving license, compliant to ISO/IEC 18013
or ISO/IEC TR 19446 supporting PACE, AA and CA, as both applications (MRTD
and IDL) share the same protocols and data structure organization. Therefore, in
the rest of the document, the word “MRTD” MAY be understood either as a MRTD
in the sense of ICAO, or a driving license compliant to ISO/IEC 18013 or ISO/IEC
TR 19446 depending on the targeted usage envisioned by the issuer.

Application note
This TOE claims an assurance level EAL5 augmented with AVA_VAN.5 and
ALC_DVS.2. AVA_VAN.5 implies that the TOE is resistant to attacks performed by
an attacker possessing "High attack potential".
Not all key sizes specified in this security target have sufficient cryptographic
strength for satisfying the AVA_VAN.5 “high attack potential”. In order to be
protected against attackers with a "high attack potential", sufficiently large
cryptographic key sizes SHALL be configured for this TOE. References can be
found in national and international document standards. Further details have
been specified in the TOE’s guidance documentation [AGD_PRE].

1.4.2 TOE usage and security features for operational use
Depending on its configuration during pre-personalisation and personalisation,
the TOE can be used as:
    ICAO/EAC eMRTD,
    Polymorphic eMRTD and
    EU/ISO Driving Licence.

The ICAO/EAC eMRTD, Polymorphic eMRTD and Driver Licence are installed as a
separate application instances of the applet having their own dedicated
application identifiers and personalisation. The following TOE configurations are
covered within the scope of this Security Target:

[TR-03110] have also been refered to in ISO18013 for EU driving licences. The
BAP-1 protocol defined in ISO18013 is equal to Basic Access Protocol (BAC)
defined in [ICAO-9303]. As to the logical data structure, the ISO18013 uses the
same concept of Passive Authentication defined in [ICAO-9303], but specifies
different ISO7816-4 elementary file identifiers for storing the ICAO defined
content of DG3, DG4 and DG15.

When an Issuing state is using the product as an ISO compliant Driving licence,
the following name mapping of roles, definitions, data groups and protocol is

6.1.5                  Memory access control
Usage of multiple applications in one Smartcard often requires code and data separation in order to prevent
that one application can access code and/or data of another application. For this reason the TOE provides Area
based Memory Access Control. The underlying Memory Protection Unit (MPU) is documented in Appendix B3.5
of the ARMv7 M architecture reference manual [ARMv7M].
In particular, the MPU provides full support for:
 Protection regions.
 Overlapping protection regions, with ascending region priority:
  − Region 7 = highest priority.
  − Region 0 = lowest priority.
 Access permissions.
   MPU mismatches and permission violations invoke the programmable-priority MemManage fault handler.

The MPU can be used to:
   Enforce privilege rules, preventing user applications from corrupting operating system data.
   Separate processes, blocking the active task from accessing other tasks’ data.
   Enforce access rules, allowing memory regions to be defined as read-only or detecting unexpected memory
    accesses.

The SFRs are provided by the Memory Access Control Policy (FDP_ACC.1 and dependencies).


6.1.5.1                Subjects, objects and operations of the Memory Access Control Policy
Subjects:
 MPU

Objects:

Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)

 MPU enable/disable bit.
 8 regions with the following attributes
    − a unique priority
    − the enable bit
    − the xn (execute never) bit
    − the start address and size
    − an access matrix which defines if an Operation of the MPU (Subject) to a memory/code address (Object)
     lying in the region is allowed or denied
 A bit defining the acces behavior of the default region, i.e. memory/code addresses not covered by one of the
  8 MPU regions.


Security Attributes for objects:
There are no security attributes for objects.


6.1.5.3            Access control rules of the Memory Access Control Policy
The following generic rules shall apply in case the MPU is enabled. In case the MPU is disabled, a privileged and
unprivileged code has full read/write/execute rights to all addresses.
 If an address is contained in multiple enabled regions, then the region with the highest priority defines the
    access rights.
   If an address is contained in no region then the default region defines the access rights.
   The region defining the access rights checks if the Subject has access to the Object with respect to the desired
    Operation. In case the access is denied the MPU throws an access violation exception. The checks are done
    according to the access matrix inTable 21.
   overlapping regions, have access to other regions with ascending region priority:
    region 7 = highest priority, region 0 = lowest priority
   execution of code is bound to the read access of Table 21 and the xn bit. If the xn bit is cleared and read
    access is enabled then execution of code is defined by Table 21. If the xn bit is set then execution is never
    allowed.

The key lengths used for the AES and DES functionality follow the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100
bit security level issued by the BSI1. This regulation excludes the single DES operation from the certification as it
is considered to be not sufficiently secure from algorithm perspective.
For both versions, the certification covers the SCL cryptographic functionality of the AES algorithm with key
lengths of 128, 192, 256 bits and the TDEA or TripleDES (TDES) algorithm with an effective key size of 112 and
168 Bits. For the version v2.04.002 the certification covers the CMAC functionality too.

Beside the inclusion and support of cryptographic libraries this TOE comes with the optional Hardware Support
Library (HSL) in different alternative versions significantly simplifying the management of the SOLID FLASH™
NVM functionality. The HSL (all versions) constitutes an application interface (API) accessing the HSL state
machine and abstracting low level properties like special function registers and settings of specific hardware

features. In short the HSL provides a user friendly also use case oriented interface considering endurance,
reliability and performance.
All HSL library versions are delivered as object code.
The HSL is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software.
All HSL versions implement, beyond the low level driver, the basic method In-place Update leveraging the
dedicated advantages of the new SOLID FLASH™ NVM technology.
In addition to the above, all HSL versions provide an advanced additional method called Incremental Write (IWR).
This method provides enhanced endurance of the SOLID FLASH NVM even beyond the erase endurance limits
for often written objects. Thus this method serves applications with a demand for high endurance and fast
writing times. On the other hand, the read times using this method are slower than the other methods provided.
The HSL versions provide tearing save behavior, whereas we define tearing as an untimed power cut off which
could occur anytime and in the worse therewith could also occur during writing to or erasing of pages in the
SOLID FLASH™ NVM.
If the HSL – all versions are meant - comes with the TOE and the user implements the offered configuration and
dedicated functions tearing save behaviour of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM is provided. In these cases the user does
not need to care about tearing events since either the old data or the new data are correctly in place.
In addition to the versions 01.22.4346 and 02.01.6634, the HSLs in versions 03.11.8339 and 03.12.8812 provide a
furthermore improved method for the Incremental Write (IWR).
But, even in the cases where the user decides not to use the HSL and did also not implement own routines
preserving the consistency of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM, the hardware protection means prevent from operation
of inconsistent data. Therefore, in no cases a tearing event leads to an exploitable situation respectively
vulnerability.
Anyhow, the user should be aware and is recommended to use either the HSL or implement own routines
managing tearing events since if there would occur a faulty programmed SOLID FLASH™ NVM location the TOE
ends operation at that point.

The order option CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CIPURSE™ CL) provides cryptographic functionality to
implement a CIPURSE™ V2 conformant protocol.
This protocol provides a secure mutual authentication of two entities, namely the terminal (denoted as PCD =
Proximity Coupling Device (CIPURSE™-compliant terminal)) and a smart card or a token in other form factors
which is called PICC. PICC stands for Proximity Integrated Circuit Card (CIPURSE™-compliant card).
Beside the mutual authentication, the protocol implements measures to maintain the integrity of the after
passing successfully the authentication transferred data. It depends on the chosen operation mode whether the
user requires integrity protection only, for example if the exchange is used in a secure environment only, or
whether complete protection including the encrypted transfer of user data between the two authentication
entities is an issue. Both operation modes are part of the CIPURSE™ open standard and offered as integrity
protection mode and as confidential communication mode.
By that the CIPURSE™ CL supports the user to implement systems conformant to the CIPURSE™ open standard
implementing a secured, interoperable and flexible transit fare collection solution, including ISO 7816, ISO/IEC
14443-4 communication and AES-128 bit cryptography for multiple payment types.
The CIPURSE™ CL is conformant to the CIPURSE™ open standard [18] for both, the PICC and then PCD software
parts. It implements the by the OSPT alliance standardized application interface for the card and the terminal
side.
The scope of this certification of this TOE covers all parts of the CIPURSE™ CL which are later implemented by
the user on the user card respectively token based on this TOE and the functionality of the PCD software part
which is implemented in the terminal side. The PCD software operates also on the hardware of this TOE which is
implemented in the terminal.
The CIPURSE™ CL implements the by the OSPT alliance standardized application interface for the card and the
terminal side.
The certification comprises the entire functionality of the optional CIPURSE™ CL implemented and operated on
the TOE hardware. On one hand the TOE can operate the PICC side software part as a token and on the other
hand, a second TOE product operates the PCD side software part if used inside a terminal or similar system.

Target of Evaluation Description


The environment on the terminal, the terminal systems, their security and their interfaces to the background
systems are not in the scope of this certification. The user operating system and further applications
implemented on the TOE are also out of scope of this certification.
To summarize, if used with the PCD software the certification view equals to the case where the TOE is running
the PICC software: The TOE operates one of the optional software parts of the CIPURSE™ CL – regardless
whether PICC or PCD part - and is enabled to communicate via the selected interfaces. The surrounding
environment is in both cases out of scope. The CIPURSE™ CL is delivered as object code and in this way
integrated in the user software.

The NRG software is a further order option, which implements the routines for a NRG interface. The NRG
implements an operating system handling the emulation of an NRG card together with the RF interface. One
part of the NRG software is permanently stored in the ROM and the second part consisting of patch and API is
located in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The second part is only present if the NRG is a part of the delivery. If the
NRG is not part of the delivery the ROM part is present but not used. The NRG implements tearing safe
behaviour in context with the SOLID FLASH™ NVM management and is therefore independent from the HSL.
The NRG NVM part is – if ordered – delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software.
The NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

Note 1:
The asymmetric cryptographic libraries regardless of the version chosen are delivery options.
Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations with the other libraries of or without these libraries. In the
case of coming without one or any combination of the asymmetric libraries the TOE does not provide the
Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or Elliptic Curve
Cryptography (EC).

The symmetric cryptographic library SCL, in two alternative versions, is a delivery option.
Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations with the other libraries of or without these libraries. In the
case of coming without the SCL the TOE does not provide the specific security functionality implemented by this
software. Even in case of a TOE coming without SCL, the symmetric cryptographic functionality is unchanged
covered by the hardware symmetric cryptographic coprocessor SCP.

The presence of the cryptographic library CIPURSE™ CL is a delivery option.
Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations with the other libraries of or without these libraries. In the
case of coming without the CIPURSE™ CL, the TOE does not provide the specific security functionality
implemented by this software.
End of note.

2.2.3          Interfaces of the TOE
       The physical interface of the TOE to the external environment is the entire surface of the IC.
       The electrical interface of the TOE to the external environment is constituted by the pads of the chip,
        particularly ISO pads, the CLK and power supply pads, as well as the pads used for contactless and
        contact based interfacing.
        A further electrical interface are the La and Lb pads used for the antenna connection and alternatively for
        the ACLB communication mode connecting an external reader chip which is not part of the TOE.
       The RF interface (radio frequency power and signal interface) enables contactless communication
        between a PICC (proximity integration chip card, PICC) and a PCD reader/writer (proximity coupling
        device, PCD). Power supply is received and data are received or transmitted by an antenna which
        consists of a coil with a few turns directly connected to the IC. Depending on customer orders the
        contactless interface options are set by means of blocking either at Infineon premises or at the premises
        of the user.
       The data-oriented I/O interface to the TOE is formed by the pads used for contact based or contactless
        communication.
       The interface to the firmware – regardless of the version chosen – is constituted by special registers used
        for hardware configuration and control (Special Function Registers, SFR).
       The interface of the TOE to the operating system is constituted by the RMS and by the instruction set of
        the TOE.
       The interface of the TOE to the test routines is formed by the BOS test routine call, i.e. entry to the test

The following provides a brief overview of the document set constituting the user guidance for this TOE. The
exact document titles and versions are given in chapter 9.
    The document Hardware Reference Manual HRM [1] is the user data book of the TOE and contains the
        relevant module, function and feature description
    The document Production and Personalization User Manual [2] contains detailed information about the
        usage of the Flash Loader
    The document Programmers Reference Manual [3] describes the usage and interfaces of the Resource
        Management System RMS, of the NRG Software and of the RFAPI.

2.2.5          Forms of delivery
The TOE can be delivered:
    in form of complete modules
    with or without inlay mounting
    with or without inlay antenna mounting
    in form of plain wafers
    in any IC case (for example TSSOP28, VQFN32, VQFN40, CCS-modules, etc.)
    in no IC case or package, simply as bare dies
    or in whatever type of package

The form of delivery does not affect the TOE security and it can be delivered in any type, as long as the processes
applied and sites involved have been subject of the appropriate audit.
The delivery can therefore be at the end of phase 3 or at the end of phase 4 which can also include pre-
personalization steps according to PP [9]. Nevertheless in both cases the TOE is finished and the extended test
features are removed. In this document are always both cases mentioned to avoid incorrectness but from the
security policy point of view the two cases are identical.
The delivery to the software developer (phase 2  phase 1) contains the development package and is delivered
in form of documentation as described above, data carriers and/or download from a secure server containing the
tools and emulators as development and debugging tool.
Part of the software delivery can also be the Flash Loader software running on the TOE and receiving the
transmitted information of the user software to be loaded into the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The download is only
possible after successful mutual authentication and the user software can also be downloaded in an encrypted
way. This download can also be done at a third party acting as download service provider for the user. This
organization is subject of the user.
In any case, the user is after finalization of the download and prior delivery to the field obligated to permanently
lock further use of the Flash Loader. How the user can do this is detailed in the user guidance [2].
Note that it depends on the procurement order, whether the Flash Loader program is present or not.

The belonging user guidance documents are delivered in electronic form: Either by user downloads from a secure
server or alternatively on request as encrypted email attachment.

2.2.6          Production sites
The TOE may be handled in different production sites until delivery, but the wafers of this TOE are produced in
Taiwan at two different production sites. For logistic and capacity reasons the production lines have been
doubled and thus this certification comprises the products of both production lines.
To distinguish the different production sites in the field, the two sites are coded into the Generic Chip Ident Mode
(GCIM) data. The exact coding of the generic chip identification data is described in the hardware reference
manual HRM [1].
The delivery measures are described in the ALC_DVS aspect.

The production lines are coded as follows:
Taiwan: One production line is coded with »0Dh« and the other is coded with »0Ah«

The Security IC Platform Protection Profile with Augmentation Packages is registered and certified by the
Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) under the reference:
                            BSI-CC-PP-0084-2014, Version 1.0, dated 2014-01-13.
The security assurance requirements of the TOE are according to the Security IC Platform Protection Profile [9]
and to Part 3 of the Common Criteria version v3.1 [12].

Package Claim
This Security Target claims conformance to the following additional packages taken from the Security IC
Platform Protection Profile [9]:

•       Package Authentication of the Security IC, section 7.2, augmented
•       Package Loader, Package 1: Loader dedicated for usage in secured environment only, section 7.3.1,
conformant
This package is optional and fulfilled only by TOE products coming with Flash Loader.
•       Package Loader, Package 2: Loader dedicated for usage by authorized users only,
section 7.3.2, conformant
This package is optional and fulfilled only by TOE products coming with Flash Loader.
•       Package TDES ; section 7.4.1, augmented
The symmetric cryptographic coprocessor SCP can be blocked and the symmetric cryptographic library SCL is an
optional software. Thus this package is optional, but if one of both is available the claim is fulfilled and
augmented.
•       Package AES ; section 7.4.2, augmented
The symmetric cryptographic coprocessor SCP can be blocked and the symmetric cryptographic library SCL is an
optional software. Thus this package is optional, but if one of both is available the claim is fulfilled and
augmented.

                                     The assurance level of this TOE is:
                                        EAL6 augmented (EAL6+)

Public Security Target
Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Conformance Claims (ASE_CCL)


The highest assurance component AVA_VAN.5 Vulnerability Assessment, advanced methodical vulnerability
analysis, is already standard requirement for the EAL6. Thus the augmentation is achieved by another assurance
class.

Conformance Rationale
This security target claims strict conformance only to the PP [9].
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is a typical security IC as defined in PP chapter 1.2.2 comprising:
•       the circuitry of the IC (hardware including the physical memories),
•       configuration data, initialization data related to the IC Dedicated Software and the behavior of the
security functionality
•       the IC Dedicated Software with the parts
•       the IC Dedicated Test Software,
•       the IC Dedicated Support Software.
The TOE is designed, produced and/or generated by the TOE Manufacturer.

Security Problem Definition
Following the PP [9], the security problem definition is enhanced by adding additional threats, organization
security policies and an augmented assumption. Including these add-ons, the security problem definition of this
security target is consistent with the statement of the security problem definition in the PP [9], as the security
target claimed strict conformance to the PP [9].

Conformance Rationale
The augmented organizational security policy P.Add-Functions, coming from the additional security
functionality of the cryptographic libraries, the augmented assumption A.Key-Function, related to the usage of
key-depending function, and the threat memory access violation T.Mem-Access, due to specific TOE memory
access control functionality, have been added. These add-ons have no impact on the conformance statements
regarding CC [10] and PP [9], with following rational:
•        The security target remains conformant to CC [10], claim 482 as the possibility to introduce additional
restrictions is given.
•        The security target fulfils the strict conformance claim of the PP [9] due to the application notes 5, 6 and
7 which apply here. By those notes the addition of further security functions and security services are covered,
even without deriving particular security functionality from a threat but from a policy.



3.1.1          Adding Objectives

Due to additional security functionality coming from
     the cryptographic libraries
            o O.Add-Functions,
     the memory access control
            o O.Mem-Access
     and objectives related to the Flash Loader
            o O.Authentication,
            o O.Cap_Avail_Loader,
            o O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader and
            o O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality
additional security objectives have been introduced.
These add-ons have no impact on the conformance statements regarding CC [10] and PP [9] with following
rational:

Public Security Target
Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Conformance Claims (ASE_CCL)


       The security target remains conformant to CC [10], claim 482 as the possibility to introduce additional
        restrictions is given.
       The security target fulfils the strict conformance of the PP [9] due to the application note 9 applying
        here. This note allows the definition of high-level security goals due to further functions or services
        provided to the Security IC Embedded Software.


3.1.2          AES and TDES

The PP [9] implements the optional policy cryptographic services P.Crypto_Service with its packages TDES and
AES. This TOE provides these optional packages requiring secure hardware based cryptographic services for the
IC Embedded Software as outlined in chapter 7.1.4.
Due to these optional additional security functionalities the security objectives O.TDES and O.AES have been
introduced. These add-ons have no impact on the conformance statements regarding CC [10] and PP [9], with
following rational:
      The security target fulfils the strict conformance claim of the PP [9] due to the application notes applying
        here. By these notes the addition of further security functions and security services are covered, even
        without deriving particular security functionality from a threat or a policy.


3.1.3          Loader

The PP [9] implements the optional policy for applying a Loader. The Loader is used to load data into the SOLID
FLASH™ NVM.
The Flash Loader provides the service for authentication and implements the Package for Authentication of the
Security IC containing FIA_API.1 Authentication Proof of Identity of the TOE against a user.
This means that the user clearly can identify the TOE on his external request. This fulfils the objective
O.Authentication, authentication to external entities, and obligates an objective to the environment
OE.TOE_Auth, external entities authenticating of the TOE as outlined in the PP [9].
The Loader policy defines the Package 1 with its policy P.LIM_Block_Loader where the Loader is dedicated for
usage in secured environment only and the Package 2 with its policy P.Ctlr_Loader where the Loader is
dedicated for usage by authorized users only.
 This TOE provides a Flash Loader complying with the optional packages:
       Package 1:
        Loader dedicated for usage in secured environment only
       Package 2:
        Loader dedicated for usage by authorized users only as outlined in sections 7.2 and 7.3 of the PP [9]

3.1.4         CIPURSE Cryptographic Library (CCL)

The TOE provides “Additional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions)” including the CIPURSE™
Cryptography. This cryptographic functionality implements additional cryptographic services by implementation
of a protocol providing a secure mutual authentication of two entities, namely the terminal (denoted as PCD =
Proximity Coupling Device (CIPURSE™-compliant terminal)) and a smart card or a token in other form factors
which is called PICC. PICC stands for Proximity Integrated Circuit Card (CIPURSE™-compliant card).
Beside the mutual authentication, the protocol implements measures to maintain the integrity of the transferred
data and preserves in parallel the confidentiality of the transferred data.
Due to these additional security functionalities the security objectives
     O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL
     O.Prot_Integrity
     O.Prot_Confidentiality
have been introduced.

3.1.5          Summary

All of the above add-ons have no impact on the conformance statements regarding CC [10] and PP [9], with
following rational:
The security target fulfils the strict conformance claim of the PP [9] due to the application notes 9 applying here.
By this note the addition of further security functions and security services are covered, even without deriving
particular security functionality from a threat or a policy.
Due to the above rational, the security objectives of this security target are consistent with the statement of the
security objectives in the PP [9], as the security target claims package augmentation to the PP [9].
All security functional requirements defined in the PP [9] are included and completely defined in this ST.
A listing of all security functional requirements and where those are taken from is given in chapter 7.1.

The following security functional requirement is included and completely defined in this ST, section 6.

The content of the PP [9] applies to this chapter completely.


4.1            Threats
The threats are directed against the assets and/or the security functions of the TOE. For example, certain attacks
are only one step towards a disclosure of assets while others may directly lead to a compromise of the
application security. The more detailed description of specific attacks is given later on in the process of
evaluation and certification.
The threats to security are defined and described in PP [9] section 3.2, respectively for T.Masquerade_TOE in
chapter 7.2.1.

4.1.1          Additional Threat due to TOE specific Functionality
Threat Memory Access Violation
The additional functionality of introducing sophisticated privilege levels and access control allows the secure
separation between the operation system(s) and applications, the secure downloading of applications after
personalization and enables multitasking by separating memory areas and performing access controls between
different applications. Due to this additional functionality “area based memory access control” a new threat is
introduced.
The Smartcard Embedded Software is responsible for its User data of the Composite TOE according to the
assumption “Treatment of User data of the Composite TOE (A.Resp-Appl)”. However, the Smartcard Embedded
Software may comprise different parts, for instance an operating system and one or more applications. In this
case, such parts may accidentally or deliberately access data (including code) of other parts, which may result in
a security violation.

The TOE shall avert the threat “Memory Access Violation (T.Mem-Access)” as specified below:

 T.Mem-            Memory Access Violation
 Access
                   Parts of the Smartcard Embedded Software may cause security violations by accidentally or
                   deliberately accessing restricted data (which may include code) or privilege levels. Any
                   restrictions are defined by the security policy of the specific application context and must be
                   implemented by the Smartcard Embedded Software.

Threat Diffusion of Open Samples
The additional functionality of a Loader as defined in the PP [9], section 7.3 requires to address the following
threat, as defined in the document “PP0084: Interpretation” [9.1].
The TOE shall avert the threat “Diffusion of open Samples (T.Open_Samples_Diffusion)” as specified below:

 T.Open_Samples_Diffusion         Diffusion of Open Samples
                                  An attacker may get access to open samples of the TOE and use them to gain
                                  information about the TSF (loader, memory management unit, ROM code …).
                                  He may also use the open samples to characterize the behavior of the IC and its
                                  security functionalities (for example: characterization of side channel profiles,
                                  perturbation cartography …). The execution of a dedicated security features
                                  (for example: execution of a DES computation without countermeasures or by
                                  de-activating countermeasures) through the loading of an adequate code
                                  would allow this kind of characterization and the execution of enhanced
                                  attacks on the IC.

Note:
This threat is only relevant if the Flash Loader is still available and the attacker would in addition have the
authentication key. If both would be given, then this would enable downloading additional software.
End of note.

4.1.2          Assets regarding the Threats
The primary assets concern the User data which includes the user data of the Composite TOE as well as program
code (Security IC Embedded Software) stored and in operation and the provided security services. These assets
have to be protected while being executed and or processed and on the other hand, when the TOE is not in
operation.
This leads to four primary assets with its related security concerns:
    / SC1 integrity of user data of the Composite TOE
     SC2 confidentiality of user data of the Composite TOE being stored in the TOE’s protected memory
        areas
     SC3 correct operation of the security services provided by the TOE for the Security IC Embedded
        Software
     SC4 continuous availability of random numbers
SC4 is an additional security service provided by this TOE which is the availability of random numbers. These
random numbers are generated either by a true random number or a deterministic random number generator or

by both, when a true random number is used as seed for the deterministic random number generator. Note that
the generation of random numbers is a requirement of the PP [9].
To be able to protect the listed assets the TOE shall protect its security functionality as well. Therefore critical
information about the TOE shall be protected. Critical information includes:
      logical design data, physical design data, IC Dedicated Software, and configuration data
      Initialization Data and Pre-personalization Data, specific development aids, test and characterization
        related data, material for software development support, and reticles.
The information and material produced and/or processed by the TOE Manufacturer in the TOE development and
production environment (Phases 2 up to TOE Delivery) can be grouped as follows:
      logical design data,
      physical design data,
      IC Dedicated Software, Security IC Embedded Software, Initialization Data and Pre-personalization
        Data,
      specific development aids,
      test and characterization related data,
      material for software development support, and
      reticles and products in any form
as long as they are generated, stored, or processed by the TOE Manufacturer.
For details see PP [9] section 3.1.


4.2            Organizational Security Policies
The TOE has to be protected during the first phases of their lifecycle (phases 2 up to TOE delivery which can be
after phase 3 or phase 4). Later on each variant of the TOE has to protect itself. The organizational security policy
according to PP [9] covers this aspect.

 P.Process-TOE              Identification during TOE Development and Production
                            An accurate identification must be established for the TOE. This requires that each
                            instantiation of the TOE carries this unique identification.

Due to the augmentations of PP [9] and the chosen packages additional policies are introduced and described in
the next chapter.

4.2.1          Augmented Organizational Security Policy
Due to the augmentations of the PP [9] and the chosen packages additional policies are introduced.
The TOE provides specific security functionality, which can be used by the Smartcard Embedded Software. In the
following specific security functionality is listed which is not derived from threats identified for the TOE’s
environment because it can only be decided in the context of the smartcard application, against which threats
the Smartcard Embedded Software will use the specific security functionality.
The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the policy “Additional Specific Security Functionality
(P.Add-Functions)” as specified below.

P.Add-Functions                   Additional Specific Security Functionality
                                  The TOE shall provide the following specific security functionality to the
                                  Smartcard Embedded Software:
                                      Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA)
                                      Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC)
                                      CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CCL)
                                      Cipher based Message Authentication Code (CMAC by the SCL-1)

Note 2:
The cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL, and the Toolbox library as stated in chapter 1.1 are delivery
options. Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations of or even without these libraries. In the case of
coming without one or any combination of the cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL, the TOE does not
provide the Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or Elliptic
Curve Cryptography (EC) and/or CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library and/or Cipher based Message Authentication
Code (CMAC by SCL-1).
The Toolbox Library is no cryptographic library, provides no additional specific security functionality and thus the
Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
End of note.

The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the organizational security policy “Cryptographic services of the
TOE (P.Crypto-Service)” as specified below:

 P.Crypto-Service              Cryptographic services of the TOE
                               The TOE provides secure hardware based cryptographic services for the IC
                               Embedded Software.
                                   Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES)
                                   Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

Note 3:
This TOE can come with both cryptographic coprocessors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked
Crypto2304T, or with both crypto co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior
to the production of the hardware. In case the SCP is blocked, no AES and DES respectively CMAC computation
supported by hardware or SCL is possible. In case the Crypto2304T is blocked, no RSA and EC computation – of
any version as stated in chapter 1.1 - supported by hardware is possible. No accessibility of the deselected
cryptographic co-processors is without impact on any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to
the situation where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic co-processors.
End of note.

The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the organizational security policy “Limiting and Blocking the Loader
Functionality (P.Lim_Block_Loader)” as specified below:

 P.Lim_Block_Loader             Limiting and Blocking the Loader Functionality
                                The composite manufacturer uses the Loader for loading of Security IC
                                Embedded Software, user data of the Composite Product or IC Dedicated

                                and blocks the availability of the Loader in order to protect stored data from

4.3           Assumptions
The TOE assumptions on the operational environment are defined and described in PP [9] section 3.4.
The assumptions concern the phases where the TOE has left the chip manufacturer.
The support of cipher schemas requires an additional assumption.

 A.Process-Sec-IC                Protection during Packaging, Finishing and Personalization
                                 It is assumed that security procedures are used after delivery of the TOE by
                                 the TOE Manufacturer up to delivery to the end-consumer to maintain
                                 confidentiality and integrity of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test
                                 data (to prevent any possible copy, modification, retention, theft or
                                 unauthorized use).
 A.Resp-Appl                     Treatment of User data of the Composite TOE
                                 All User data of the Composite TOE are owned by Security IC Embedded
                                 Software. Therefore, it must be assumed that security relevant User data of
                                 the Composite TOE (especially cryptographic keys) are treated by the
                                 Security IC Embedded Software as defined for its specific application context.


4.3.1         Augmented Assumptions
The developer of the Smartcard Embedded Software must ensure the appropriate “Usage of Key-dependent
Functions (A.Key-Function)” while developing this software in Phase 1 as specified below.

 A.Key-Function               Usage of Key-dependent Functions
                              Key-dependent functions (if any) shall be implemented in the Smartcard
                              Embedded Software in a way that they are not susceptible to leakage attacks
                              (as described under T.Leak-Inherent and T.Leak-Forced).

Note that here the routines which may compromise keys when being executed are part of the Smartcard
Embedded Software. In contrast to this the threats T.Leak-Inherent and T.Leak-Forced address (i) the
cryptographic routines which are part of the TOE. For details please refer to PP [9] section 3.4.

4.3.2          Note regarding CIPURSE™ CL
The CIPURSE™ CL as cryptographic functionality establishes a cryptographic secured communication channel
between two identified entities. Depending on the implementation and usage, the CIPURSE™ CL can act either
in the PICC or in the PCD role. In any case the secrets applied for establishing and usage of the secured channel
must be treated in an appropriate way by both entities PICC and PCD.
This means that it is essential on user side that the critical data for establishing this cryptographic secured
communication channel is generated and stored in an appropriate way and that integrity and confidentiality is
maintained.
These preconditions are treated in the PP [9] section 3.1 claims 67 and 68, and are the reason for not placing an

 5             Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)
This section shows the subjects and objects where are relevant to the TOE.
A short overview is given in the following.
The user has the following standard high-level security goals related to the assets:
     SG1 maintain the integrity of user data (when being executed/processed and when being stored in the
        TOE´s memories)
     SG2 maintain the confidentiality of user data (when being executed/processed and when being stored in
        the TOE´s memories)
     SG3 maintain the correct operation of the security services provided by the TOE for the Security IC
        Embedded Software
     SG4 provision of random numbers.

Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


Note 4:
The objectives O.Cap_Avail_Loader, O. Authentication, O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader and O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality
apply only at TOE products coming with activated Flash Loader enabled for software or data download by the
user. In other cases the Flash Loader is not available anymore and the user software or data download is
completed. Depending on the capabilities of the user software these objectives may then reoccur as subject of
the composite TOE.
End of note.

The TOE provides “Additional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions)” as specified below.

 O.Add-Functions              Additional Specific Security Functionality
                              The TOE must provide the following specific security functionality to the
                              Smartcard Embedded Software:
                                  Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA)
                                  Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC)
                                  CIPURSE™ Cryptography
                                  Cipher base Message authentication code (CMAC)

Note 5:
The cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL and the Toolbox library are delivery options, regardless of the
version chosen. Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations of or even without these libraries. In the
case of coming without one or any combination of the cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL the TOE does
not provide the Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC) and/or CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library and/or Cipher based Message
Authentication Code (CMAC by the SCL-1).
The Toolbox Library is no cryptographic library, provides no additional specific security functionality and thus the
Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
End of note.

Note 6:
This TOE can come with both crypto co-processors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked
Crypto2304T, or with both crypto co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior
to the production of the hardware. In case the SCP is blocked, no AES and DES computation supported by
hardware is possible. In case the Crypto2304T is blocked, no RSA and EC computation – in any of the version
stated in chapter 1.1 – supported by hardware is possible. No accessibility of the deselected cryptographic co-
processors is without impact on any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the situation
where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic co-processors.
End of note.

Note 7:
In case the SCP is blocked, no AES, no DES and no Cipher based Message Authentication Code (CMAC by SCL)
computation supported by hardware is possible and thus the CIPURSE™ CL and SCL usage is not possible. This is
regardless of the library version chosen.
End of note.

Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


The TOE shall provide “Area based Memory Access Control (O.Mem-Access)” as specified below.

 O.Mem Access                Area based Memory Access Control
                             The TOE must provide the Smartcard Embedded Software with the capability to
                             define restricted access memory areas. The TOE must then enforce the
                             partitioning of such memory areas so that access of software to memory areas and
                             privilege levels is controlled as required, for example, in a multi-application
                             environment.

The additional functionality of a Loader as defined in the PP [9], section 7.3 requires to address the following
objective, as defined in the document “PP0084: Interpretation” [9.1].
The TOE shall provide “Protection of the confidentiality of the TSF (O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality)” as specified
below:

O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality Protection of the confidentiality of the TSF
                           The TOE must provide protection against disclosure of confidential operations of
                           the Security IC (loader, memory management unit …) through the use of a
                           dedicated code loaded on open samples.

If the CIPURSE™ CL is ordered the additional functionality address the following objectives as defined in this
document:

 O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL              Authentication of entities
                              The CIPURSE™ CL must implement mutual authentication to establish a ready to
                              use secure communication channel between two authenticated entities before
                              any other communication between the two entities is applied.

 O.Prot_Integrity             Integrity protection
                              The CIPURSE™ CL must implement integrity protection functionality for the user
                              data to be exchanged via the secure communication channel.

 O.Prot_Confidentiality Confidentiality protection
                        The CIPURSE™ CL must protect the confidentiality of the user data to be
                        exchanged via the secure communication channel if the user configures
                        accordingly.

5.2            Security Objectives from PP for development and environment
The security objectives for the security IC embedded software development environment and the operational
environment are defined in PP [9] section 4.2, 4.3, 7.2.1and 7.3.

For secure use of the CIPURSE™ CL it is essential that on user side the common secret is generated and stored in
an appropriate way and that integrity and confidentiality of this user secret is maintained. These preconditions
are treated in the PP [9] section 3.1 claims 67 and 68.

The operational environment of the TOE shall provide “Limitation of capability and blocking the Loader
“OE.Lim_Block_Loader”, “External entities authentication of the TOE “OE.TOE_Auth" and “Secure
communication and usage of the Loader “OE.Loader¬Usage” as specified below:

 OE.Lim_Block_Loader            Limitation of capability and blocking the Loader
                                The Composite Product Manufacturer will protect the Loader functionality
                                against misuse, limit the capability of the Loader and terminate irreversibly
                                the Loader after intended usage of the Loader.
 OE.TOE_Auth                    Authentication to external entities
                                The operational environment shall support the authentication verification
                                mechanism and know authentication reference data of the TOE.
 OE.Loader_Usage                Secure communication and usage of the Loader
                                The authorized user must support the trusted communication with the TOE by
                                confidentiality protection and authenticity proof of the data to be loaded and
                                fulfilling the access conditions required by the Loader.
 OE.Process-Sec-IC              Protection during composite product manufacturing
                                The protection during packaging, finishing and personalization includes also
                                the personalization process (Flash Loader) and the personalization data (TOE
                                software components) during Phase 4, Phase 5 and Phase 6.

The objectives OE.Lim_Block_Loader, OE.TOE_Auth, OE.Loader_Usage and OE.Process-Sec-IC for the
development and operation environment apply only at TOE products coming with activated Flash Loader
enabled for user data download. In other cases the Flash Loader is not available anymore and the user data
download is completed. Depending on the capabilities of the user software this objective may then reoccur as
subject of the composite TOE.
End of note.


5.3            Security Objectives for the Environment
Since the CIPURSE™ CL requires the presence of a common secret on both communication entities an additional
objective for the environment is generated:
Following objectives are defined here.

 OE.Resp-Appl                  Treatment of User data of the Composite TOE
                               Please refer to chapter 5.3.1 for clarification

Note 9:
The CIPURSE™ CL is a delivery option. In case the user has ordered the CIPURSE™ CL, the user is responsible to
implement the CIPURSE™ CL into his user software. In addition, the user has to generate and treat the common
secret in an appropriate way. The objective common secret is therefore similar to the OE.Resp-Appl. Anyhow,
processes and treatment is exclusively subject of the user and his logistic processes.
End of note.

Note 10:
If the user decides to use the integrity protection mode of the CIPURSE™ CL then the confidentiality of the user
data to be transferred is solely subject of the user.
End of note.

Note 11:
The CIPURSE™ CL as cryptographic functionality establishes a cryptographic secured communication channel
between two identified entities. Depending on the implementation and usage, the CIPURSE™ CL can act either
in the PICC or in the PCD role. In any case the secrets applied for establishing and usage of the secured channel
must be treated in an appropriate way by both entities PICC and PCD.
This means that it is essential on user side that the critical data for establishing this cryptographic secured
communication channel is generated and stored in an appropriate way and that integrity and confidentiality is
maintained.
These preconditions are treated in the PP [9] section 3.1 claims 67 and 68, and are the reason for not placing an
objective for the environment here.
End of note.

(1) These objectives are only valid if the TOE is delivered with active Flash Loader.


5.3.1          Clarification of “Treatment of User Data (OE.Resp-Appl)”
Regarding the cryptographic services this objective of the environment has to be clarified.
By definition cipher or plain text data and cryptographic keys are user data of the Composite TOE. The
Smartcard Embedded Software shall treat these data appropriately, use only proper secret keys (chosen from a
large key space) as input for the cryptographic function of the TOE and use keys and functions appropriately in
order to ensure the strength of cryptographic operation.
This means that keys are treated as confidential as soon as they are generated. The keys must be unique with a
very high probability, as well as cryptographically strong. For example, it must be ensured that it is beyond
practicality to derive the private key from a public key if asymmetric algorithms are used. If keys are imported
into the TOE and/or derived from other keys, quality and confidentiality must be maintained. This implies that
appropriate key management has to be realized in the environment.
Regarding the memory, software and firmware protection and the SFR and peripheral access rights handling
these objectives of the environment has to be clarified. The treatment of user data of the Composite TOE is also
required when a multi-application operating system is implemented as part of the Smartcard Embedded
Software on the TOE. In this case the multi-application operating system should not disclose security relevant
user data of one application to another application when it is processed or stored on the TOE.


5.3.2     Clarification of “Protection during Composite product Manufacturing
(OE.Process-Sec-IC)”
The protection during packaging, finishing and personalization includes also the personalization process (Flash
Loader) and the personalization data (TOE software components) during Phase 4, Phase 5 and Phase 6.

Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


 5.5           P.Add-Functions
The justification related to the security objective “Additional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions)”
is as follows: Since O.Add-Functions requires the TOE to implement exactly the same specific security
functionality as required by P.Add-Functions; the organizational security policy is covered by the objective.

Nevertheless the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing, O.Malfunction, O.Phys-Manipulation and
O.Leak-Forced define how to implement the specific security functionality required by P.Add-Functions. (Note
that these objectives support that the specific security functionality is provided in a secure way as expected from
P.Add-Functions.) Especially O.Leak-Inherent and O.Leak-Forced refer to the protection of confidential data
(User data of the Composite TOE or TSF data) in general. User data of the Composite TOE are also processed by
the specific security functionality required by P.Add-Functions.

The policy P.Add functions includes the function CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CCL). This functionality
implements the objectives O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL, O.Prot_Integrity and O.Prot_Confidentiality. The CIPURSE™
Cryptographic Library (CCL) first prepares and establishes a secure communication channel between two
authenticated entities. The mutual authentication means covers the objective O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL. The
implemented means of session key generation and integrity protection prepares for the confidential and
integrity protected exchange of user data between the two authenti        Assets regarding the Threats
The primary assets concern the User data which includes the user data of the Composite TOE as well as program
code (Security IC Embedded Software) stored and in operation and the provided security services. These assets
have to be protected while being executed and or processed and on the other hand, when the TOE is not in
operation.
This leads to four primary assets with its related security concerns:
    / SC1 integrity of user data of the Composite TOE
     SC2 confidentiality of user data of the Composite TOE being stored in the TOE’s protected memory
        areas
     SC3 correct operation of the security services provided by the TOE for the Security IC Embedded
        Software
     SC4 continuous availability of random numbers
SC4 is an additional security service provided by this TOE which is the availability of random numbers. These
random numbers are generated either by a true random number or a deterministic random number generator or

by both, when a true random number is used as seed for the deterministic random number generator. Note that
the generation of random numbers is a requirement of the PP [9].
To be able to protect the listed assets the TOE shall protect its security functionality as well. Therefore critical
information about the TOE shall be protected. Critical information includes:
      logical design data, physical design data, IC Dedicated Software, and configuration data
      Initialization Data and Pre-personalization Data, specific development aids, test and characterization
        related data, material for software development support, and reticles.
The information and material produced and/or processed by the TOE Manufacturer in the TOE development and
production environment (Phases 2 up to TOE Delivery) can be grouped as follows:
      logical design data,
      physical design data,
      IC Dedicated Software, Security IC Embedded Software, Initialization Data and Pre-personalization
        Data,
      specific development aids,
      test and characterization related data,
      material for software development support, and
      reticles and products in any form
as long as they are generated, stored, or processed by the TOE Manufacturer.
For details see PP [9] section 3.1.


4.2            Organizational Security Policies
The TOE has to be protected during the first phases of their lifecycle (phases 2 up to TOE delivery which can be
after phase 3 or phase 4). Later on each variant of the TOE has to protect itself. The organizational security policy
according to PP [9] covers this aspect.

 P.Process-TOE              Identification during TOE Development and Production
                            An accurate identification must be established for the TOE. This requires that each
                            instantiation of the TOE carries this unique identification.

Due to the augmentations of PP [9] and the chosen packages additional policies are introduced and described in
the next chapter.

4.2.1          Augmented Organizational Security Policy
Due to the augmentations of the PP [9] and the chosen packages additional policies are introduced.
The TOE provides specific security functionality, which can be used by the Smartcard Embedded Software. In the
following specific security functionality is listed which is not derived from threats identified for the TOE’s
environment because it can only be decided in the context of the smartcard application, against which threats
the Smartcard Embedded Software will use the specific security functionality.
The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the policy “Additional Specific Security Functionality
(P.Add-Functions)” as specified below.

P.Add-Functions                   Additional Specific Security Functionality
                                  The TOE shall provide the following specific security functionality to the
                                  Smartcard Embedded Software:
                                      Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA)
                                      Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC)
                                      CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CCL)
                                      Cipher based Message Authentication Code (CMAC by the SCL-1)

Note 2:
The cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL, and the Toolbox library as stated in chapter 1.1 are delivery
options. Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations of or even without these libraries. In the case of
coming without one or any combination of the cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL, the TOE does not
provide the Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or Elliptic
Curve Cryptography (EC) and/or CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library and/or Cipher based Message Authentication
Code (CMAC by SCL-1).
The Toolbox Library is no cryptographic library, provides no additional specific security functionality and thus the
Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
End of note.

The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the organizational security policy “Cryptographic services of the
TOE (P.Crypto-Service)” as specified below:

 P.Crypto-Service              Cryptographic services of the TOE
                               The TOE provides secure hardware based cryptographic services for the IC
                               Embedded Software.
                                   Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES)
                                   Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

Note 3:
This TOE can come with both cryptographic coprocessors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked
Crypto2304T, or with both crypto co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior
to the production of the hardware. In case the SCP is blocked, no AES and DES respectively CMAC computation
supported by hardware or SCL is possible. In case the Crypto2304T is blocked, no RSA and EC computation – of
any version as stated in chapter 1.1 - supported by hardware is possible. No accessibility of the deselected
cryptographic co-processors is without impact on any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to
the situation where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic co-processors.
End of note.

The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the organizational security policy “Limiting and Blocking the Loader
Functionality (P.Lim_Block_Loader)” as specified below:

 P.Lim_Block_Loader             Limiting and Blocking the Loader Functionality
                                The composite manufacturer uses the Loader for loading of Security IC
                                Embedded Software, user data of the Composite Product or IC Dedicated
                                Support Software in charge of the IC Manufacturer. He limits the capability
                                and blocks the availability of the Loader in order to protect stored data from
                                disclosure and manipulation.
 P.Ctrl_Loader                  Controlled usage to Loader Functionality
                                Authorized user controls the usage of the Loader functionality in order to
                                protect stored and loaded user data from disclosure and manipulation.



4.3           Assumptions
The TOE assumptions on the operational environment are defined and described in PP [9] section 3.4.
The assumptions concern the phases where the TOE has left the chip manufacturer.
The support of cipher schemas requires an additional assumption.

 A.Process-Sec-IC                Protection during Packaging, Finishing and Personalization
                                 It is assumed that security procedures are used after delivery of the TOE by
                                 the TOE Manufacturer up to delivery to the end-consumer to maintain
                                 confidentiality and integrity of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test
                                 data (to prevent any possible copy, modification, retention, theft or
                                 unauthorized use).
 A.Resp-Appl                     Treatment of User data of the Composite TOE
                                 All User data of the Composite TOE are owned by Security IC Embedded
                                 Software. Therefore, it must be assumed that security relevant User data of
                                 the Composite TOE (especially cryptographic keys) are treated by the
                                 Security IC Embedded Software as defined for its specific application context.


4.3.1         Augmented Assumptions
The developer of the Smartcard Embedded Software must ensure the appropriate “Usage of Key-dependent
Functions (A.Key-Function)” while developing this software in Phase 1 as specified below.

 A.Key-Function               Usage of Key-dependent Functions
                              Key-dependent functions (if any) shall be implemented in the Smartcard
                              Embedded Software in a way that they are not susceptible to leakage attacks
                              (as described under T.Leak-Inherent and T.Leak-Forced).

Note that here the routines which may compromise keys when being executed are part of the Smartcard
Embedded Software. In contrast to this the threats T.Leak-Inherent and T.Leak-Forced address (i) the
cryptographic routines which are part of the TOE. For details please refer to PP [9] section 3.4.

4.3.2          Note regarding CIPURSE™ CL
The CIPURSE™ CL as cryptographic functionality establishes a cryptographic secured communication channel
between two identified entities. Depending on the implementation and usage, the CIPURSE™ CL can act either
in the PICC or in the PCD role. In any case the secrets applied for establishing and usage of the secured channel
must be treated in an appropriate way by both entities PICC and PCD.
This means that it is essential on user side that the critical data for establishing this cryptographic secured
communication channel is generated and stored in an appropriate way and that integrity and confidentiality is
maintained.
These preconditions are treated in the PP [9] section 3.1 claims 67 and 68, and are the reason for not placing an
assumption here.

case of coming without one or any combination of the cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL the TOE does
not provide the Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC) and/or CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library and/or Cipher based Message
Authentication Code (CMAC by the SCL-1).
The Toolbox Library is no cryptographic library, provides no additional specific security functionality and thus the
Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
End of note.

Note 6:
This TOE can come with both crypto co-processors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked
Crypto2304T, or with both crypto co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior
to the production of the hardware. In case the SCP is blocked, no AES and DES computation supported by
hardware is possible. In case the Crypto2304T is blocked, no RSA and EC computation – in any of the version
stated in chapter 1.1 – supported by hardware is possible. No accessibility of the deselected cryptographic co-
processors is without impact on any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the situation
where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic co-processors.
End of note.

Note 7:
In case the SCP is blocked, no AES, no DES and no Cipher based Message Authentication Code (CMAC by SCL)
computation supported by hardware is possible and thus the CIPURSE™ CL and SCL usage is not possible. This is
regardless of the library version chosen.
End of note.

The TOE shall provide “Area based Memory Access Control (O.Mem-Access)” as specified below.

 O.Mem Access                Area based Memory Access Control
                             The TOE must provide the Smartcard Embedded Software with the capability to
                             define restricted access memory areas. The TOE must then enforce the
                             partitioning of such memory areas so that access of software to memory areas and
                             privilege levels is controlled as required, for example, in a multi-application
                             environment.

The additional functionality of a Loader as defined in the PP [9], section 7.3 requires to address the following
objective, as defined in the document “PP0084: Interpretation” [9.1].
The TOE shall provide “Protection of the confidentiality of the TSF (O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality)” as specified
below:

O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality Protection of the confidentiality of the TSF
                           The TOE must provide protection against disclosure of confidential operations of

 O.Prot_Integrity             Integrity protection
                              The CIPURSE™ CL must implement integrity protection functionality for the user

 O.Prot_Confidentiality Confidentiality protection
                        The CIPURSE™ CL must protect the confidentiality of the user data to be

5.2            Security Objectives from PP for development and environment
The security objectives for the security IC embedded software development environment and the operational
environment are defined in PP [9] section 4.2, 4.3, 7.2.1and 7.3.

For secure use of the CIPURSE™ CL it is essential that on user side the common secret is generated and stored in
an appropriate way and that integrity and confidentiality of this user secret is maintained. These preconditions
are treated in the PP [9] section 3.1 claims 67 and 68.

The operational environment of the TOE shall provide “Limitation of capability and blocking the Loader
“OE.Lim_Block_Loader”, “External entities authentication of the TOE “OE.TOE_Auth" and “Secure
communication and usage of the Loader “OE.Loader¬Usage” as specified below:

 OE.Lim_Block_Loader            Limitation of capability and blocking the Loader
                                The Composite Product Manufacturer will protect the Loader functionality
                                against misuse, limit the capability of the Loader and terminate irreversibly
                                the Loader after intended usage of the Loader.
 OE.TOE_Auth                    Authentication to external entities
                                The operational environment shall support the authentication verification
                                mechanism and know authentication reference data of the TOE.
 OE.Loader_Usage                Secure communication and usage of the Loader
                                The authorized user must support the trusted communication with the TOE by
                                confidentiality protection and authenticity proof of the data to be loaded and
                                fulfilling the access conditions required by the Loader.
 OE.Process-Sec-IC              Protection during composite product manufacturing
                                The protection during packaging, finishing and personalization includes also
                                the personalization process (Flash Loader) and the personalization data (TOE
                                software components) during Phase 4, Phase 5 and Phase 6.

Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


Note 8:
The objectives OE.Lim_Block_Loader, OE.TOE_Auth, OE.Loader_Usage and OE.Process-Sec-IC for the
development and operation environment apply only at TOE products coming with activated Flash Loader
enabled for user data download. In other cases the Flash Loader is not available anymore and the user data
download is completed. Depending on the capabilities of the user software this objective may then reoccur as
subject of the composite TOE.
End of note.


5.3            Security Objectives for the Environment
Since the CIPURSE™ CL requires the presence of a common secret on both communication entities an additional
objective for the environment is generated:
Following objectives are defined here.

 OE.Resp-Appl                  Treatment of User data of the Composite TOE
                               Please refer to chapter 5.3.1 for clarification

Note 9:
The CIPURSE™ CL is a delivery option. In case the user has ordered the CIPURSE™ CL, the user is responsible to
implement the CIPURSE™ CL into his user software. In addition, the user has to generate and treat the common
secret in an appropriate way. The objective common secret is therefore similar to the OE.Resp-Appl. Anyhow,
processes and treatment is exclusively subject of the user and his logistic processes.
End of note.

Note 10:
If the user decides to use the integrity protection mode of the CIPURSE™ CL then the confidentiality of the user
data to be transferred is solely subject of the user.
End of note.

Note 11:
The CIPURSE™ CL as cryptographic functionality establishes a cryptographic secured communication channel
between two identified entities. Depending on the implementation and usage, the CIPURSE™ CL can act either
in the PICC or in the PCD role. In any case the secrets applied for establishing and usage of the secured channel
must be treated in an appropriate way by both entities PICC and PCD.
This means that it is essential on user side that the critical data for establishing this cryptographic secured
communication channel is generated and stored in an appropriate way and that integrity and confidentiality is
maintained.
These preconditions are treated in the PP [9] section 3.1 claims 67 and 68, and are the reason for not placing an
objective for the environment here.
End of note.

(1) These objectives are only valid if the TOE is delivered with active Flash Loader.


5.3.1          Clarification of “Treatment of User Data (OE.Resp-Appl)”
Regarding the cryptographic services this objective of the environment has to be clarified.
By definition cipher or plain text data and cryptographic keys are user data of the Composite TOE. The
Smartcard Embedded Software shall treat these data appropriately, use only proper secret keys (chosen from a
large key space) as input for the cryptographic function of the TOE and use keys and functions appropriately in
order to ensure the strength of cryptographic operation.
This means that keys are treated as confidential as soon as they are generated. The keys must be unique with a
very high probability, as well as cryptographically strong. For example, it must be ensured that it is beyond
practicality to derive the private key from a public key if asymmetric algorithms are used. If keys are imported
into the TOE and/or derived from other keys, quality and confidentiality must be maintained. This implies that
appropriate key management has to be realized in the environment.
Regarding the memory, software and firmware protection and the SFR and peripheral access rights handling
these objectives of the environment has to be clarified. The treatment of user data of the Composite TOE is also
required when a multi-application operating system is implemented as part of the Smartcard Embedded
Software on the TOE. In this case the multi-application operating system should not disclose security relevant
user data of one application to another application when it is processed or stored on the TOE.


5.3.2     Clarification of “Protection during Composite product Manufacturing
(OE.Process-Sec-IC)”
The protection during packaging, finishing and personalization includes also the personalization process (Flash
Loader) and the personalization data (TOE software components) during Phase 4, Phase 5 and Phase 6.

Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


 5.5           P.Add-Functions
The justification related to the security objective “Additional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions)”
is as follows: Since O.Add-Functions requires the TOE to implement exactly the same specific security
functionality as required by P.Add-Functions; the organizational security policy is covered by the objective.

Nevertheless the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing, O.Malfunction, O.Phys-Manipulation and
O.Leak-Forced define how to implement the specific security functionality required by P.Add-Functions. (Note
that these objectives support that the specific security functionality is provided in a secure way as expected from
P.Add-Functions.) Especially O.Leak-Inherent and O.Leak-Forced refer to the protection of confidential data
(User data of the Composite TOE or TSF data) in general. User data of the Composite TOE are also processed by
the specific security functionality required by P.Add-Functions.

The policy P.Add functions includes the function CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CCL). This functionality
implements the objectives O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL, O.Prot_Integrity and O.Prot_Confidentiality. The CIPURSE™
Cryptographic Library (CCL) first prepares and establishes a secure communication channel between two
authenticated entities. The mutual authentication means covers the objective O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL. The
implemented means of session key generation and integrity protection prepares for the confidential and
integrity protected exchange of user data between the two authenticated entities. Thus the objectives
O.Prot_Integrity and O.Prot_Confidentiality are covered too.

The policy P.Add functions includes the function Cipher base Message authentication code (CMAC). This
functionality is implemented by the optional software SCL and implements the option to protect the integrity of
a user data block with a message authentication code. The computing of the CMAC requires the use of either
AES or TDES, as outlined in the chapter P.Crypto-Service 5.9 and also implemented by the optional software
SCL.


 5.6           A.Key-Function
Compared to the PP [9] a further clarification has been made for the security objective “Treatment of user data
of the Composite TOE (OE.Resp-Appl)”: By definition cipher or plain text data and cryptographic keys are user
data of the Composite TOE. So, the Smartcard Embedded Software will protect such data if required and use
keys and functions appropriately in order to ensure the strength of cryptographic operation. Quality and
confidentiality must be maintained for keys that are imported and/or derived from other keys. This implies that
appropriate key management has to be realized in the environment. That is expressed by the assumption
A.Key—Function which is covered from OE.Resp–Appl. These measures make sure that the assumption
A.Resp-Appl is still covered by the security objective OE.Resp-Appl although additional functions are being
supported according to P.Add-Functions.

 5.7           T.Mem-Access
Compared to the PP [9] an enhancement regarding memory area protection has been established. The clear
definition of privilege levels for operated software establishes the clear separation of different restricted memory
areas for running the firmware – regardless of the version in use -, downloading and/or running the operating
system and to establish a clear separation between different applications. Nevertheless, it is also possible to
define a shared memory section where separated applications may exchange defined data. The privilege levels
clearly define by using a hierarchical model the access right from one level to the other. These measures ensure
that the threat T.Mem-Access is clearly covered by the security objective O.Mem-Access.


 5.8           P.Ctrl_Loader, P.Lim_Block_Loader, T.Masquerade_TOE and
               T.Open_Samples_Diffusion
The PP [9] section 7.3 considers the life cycle phases of the TOE also with the organizational policy
P.Lim_Block_Loader and P.Ctlr_Loader as the TOE must be protected against unauthorized usage and control
and against download of malicious software before, during and after the user downloads his software. This is
formalized with the objectives O.Cap_Avail_Loader, O.Authentication and O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader requiring
authentication of the TOE to external entities and a trusted communication channel. The O.Authentication
implements a mutual authentication and involves the environment therefore.
And the policies cover also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must be
regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.
The implemented mutual authentication requires first to authenticate the TOE to the external user. This requires
also knowledge by the user about the sequence of the protocol, interpretation of the transferred data and how to
start the authentication of the TOE. This authentication mean counters the threat T.Masquerade_TOE as only
the genuine TOE is able to identify itself correctly to the enabled user, which covers O.Authentication.
The second step of the mutual authentications mean implements the authentication of the user to the TOE. Only
the user enabled to present the correct authentication data and knowing about the sequence, data
interpretation and signaling of the authentication to the TOE is able to proceed further on.
This enforces OE.TOE_Auth, requiring the support of the verification mechanism and known authentication
reference data by the operational environment.

It is normal business that products enabled for software download by the user are either on their way to the user
or are already stored at user premises. At both situations it cannot be excluded that an attacker could manage to
steal such products enabled for software downloads. The ability to download software on a chip without
operating system and/or application is defined as open sample.
This situation generates the threat T.Open_Samples_Diffusion which is defined as follows:
The download of analysis software could enable an attacker to characterize the product and to construct an
attack path out of the gained information.
This threat is countered by the Flash Loader by following rational:
As long as the Flash Loader is active, controlled usage to the Flash Loader functionality (P.Ctrl_Loader) is
enforced which protects the TOE from achieving the status of being an open sample. And more, even the
attacker could observe, meaning in the sense of measurements during, or induce faults during an authorized
download, the Flash Loader protects the user data of the download by confidentiality and integrity protection
means. The Flash Loader functionalities of mutual authentication, establishing a dedicated trusted
communication channel, the encryption and integrity protection means cover the objectives
O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality, O.Leak-Inherent and O.Leak-Forced.
The policy P.Ctrl_Loader covers also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must
be regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.

Note regarding the Flash Loader:

Public Security Target
Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


The algorithm strength of the Flash Loader has not been cryptographic-analytically evaluated by the BSI, as
Infineon has implemented a proprietary extension.
End of note.

The objective O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader Access control and authenticity for the Loader is covered by following
rational:
The identification of the communication entities of the Flash Loader requires the presence of dedicated
identification data for passing successfully the mutual authentication. This enforces the policy P.Ctrl_Loader
comprising the aspect of the mutual authentication. After successful authentication the user is enabled to
change the keys used for authentication and downloading the user data. This first user is defined as the
administrator. The TOE can then further be operated for example by a service partner who is defined as being
the Download Operator. The equal protecting means as for the Administrator apply here again but due to the
key change different roles are established. The Download Operator downloads then the encrypted user data
with the Flash Loader into the defined and accessible SOLID FLASH™ NVM area. This area is access protected by
the MMU.
The policy O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader covers also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it
must be regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.

This objective O.Leak-Inherent is covered with following rational:
This false download threat is countered with the mutual authentication mean as only the correct identified user
is able to download the user intended software and data. Since it is not practical for an attacker to authenticate
correctly a threatening download of attack software is countered. By that possible confidential user data already
stored on the TOE remain protected from disclosure by this method.
If the user is the attacker, or does not follow the user guidance, or bad designed user software implements
weaknesses, the user data remain protected anyway, since even after passing the mutual authentication of the
loader the download is conducted encrypted only. And even more, a different encryption is applied to store the
data in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. Since also the number of Flash Loader trials is limited even comprehensive
side channel analysis would not leave sufficient information to conduct a successful attack.
The implemented authentication means cover also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user
premises, as it must be regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.

This objective O.Leak-Forced is covered with following rational:
Another method to gain information is to force information leakage of confidential data processed in the TOE.
Such forcing requires malfunction or physical manipulation. Inducing errors of any kind during data processing
will be discovered by the Integrity Guard with high probability which leads to a security reset. Failures induced
during the mutual authentication or encrypted download process of the Flash Loader will also be discovered as
the perturbation of the sequences leads to fail of the process with trial counter decrement or a fail of the integrity
check of the downloaded data will occur. It would anyway not be practical to induce targeted errors as any
process managing data is protected due to the permanent and differently data encryption and integrity
protection on the TOE.
Physical static manipulation requires the presence of a worthwhile target. This is on one hand hard to identify
and would require intensive reverse engineering due to the topological means such as synthesis of the TOE and
other means. But, on the other hand, if we assume than an attacker could identify such spot, and the physical
preparation was successful too and thus it was possible to probe the targeted signal, then, even assumed the
attacker could analyze the traffic on the signal, the results would be worthless, since the signal data is encrypted
or masked. Thus, the data remains confidentiality protected even outside the TOE, since the analyst neither has
neither the encryption algorithm nor the key.
The Integrity Guard concept and encryption of memory contents are always present and cover also the
environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must be regardless in which environment the
Flash Loader is operated.

Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


All requirements are fulfilled by the Flash Loader due the strong mutual authentication means enabling only the
authorized user for the download, due to the download of encrypted data only and due to the final locking
command to be applied by the user before delivery. As a consequence the operational environment objectives
OE.Lim_Block_Loader, OE.TOE_Auth and OE.Loader_Usage obligate the composite manufacturer to protect
the authentication data (e.g. keys) against misuse and limit the capability of the Loader.
In addition, the user guidance implements the obligation to permanent disable the Flash Loader prior delivery to
the end-user.

The package 1 defines the final locking of the Flash Loader prior delivery to the end-user and the usage in secure
environment. The package 2 defines that the Flash Loader can be used also in insecure environment. By claiming
both packages the user has the choice to apply the active Flash Loader either in insecure or in secure
environment and achieves by that a maximum of flexibility. Anyhow, the user is obligated to lock the Flash
Loader prior delivery to the end-user in both cases. This is an obligation implemented by the user guidance.
The Flash Loader provides the required functionality to be applied by the composite manufacturer for covering
these objectives.

The objectives O.Cap_Avail_Loader, O.Authentication, O.Loader_Usage and O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality and
the organizational policies P.Lim_Block_Loader and P.Ctlr_Loader as discussed in the PP [9] section 7.2 and 7.3
apply only at TOE products at the life cycle phase delivery, if these products come with activated Flash Loader
enabled for software or data download by the user. In other cases the Flash Loader is not available anymore and
the user software or data download is completed. Depending on the capabilities of the user software these
objectives may then reoccur as subject of the composite TOE.

 5.9          P.Crypto-Service
The PP [9] includes the organizational security policy P.Crypto-Service Cryptographic services of the TOE in a
different extend as it formalizes the objectives O.TDES and O.AES.
For the objective O.TDES a concrete standard reference (NIST) with operational modes is given the
implementation must follow and also the cryptographic key destruction is regulated. The implementation
complies to the given security functional requirements and the objective O.TDES is met.
For the objective O.AES a concrete standard reference (NIST) with a selection of key lengths is given the
implementation must follow and also the cryptographic key destruction is regulated. The implementation
complies to the given security functional requirements and the objective O.AES is met.
For the objective O.AES a concrete standard reference with an algorithm selection is given the implementation
must follow. The implementation complies to the given security functional requirements and the objective
O.AES is met.
The justification of the additional policy and the additional assumption show that they do not contradict to the
rationale already given in the Protection Profile for the assumptions, policy and threats defined there.

There are following extended components defined and described for the TOE:
     the family FCS_RNG at the class FCS Cryptographic Support
     the family FMT_LIM at the class FMT Security Management
     the family FAU_SAS at the class FAU Security Audit
     the component FDP_SDC.1 at the class FDP User Data Protection
     the component FPT_TST.2 at the class FPT Protection of the TSF
     the component FIA_API.1 at the class FIA Identification and Authentication
The extended components FCS_RNG, FMT_LIM, FAU_SAS, FDP_SDC and FIA_API are defined and described in
PP [9] section 5 and the extended component FIA_API is defined and described in PP [9] section 7.2.
The component FPT_TST.2 is defined in the following.


6.1           Component Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)
The security is strongly dependent on the correct operation of the security functions. Therefore, the TOE shall
support that particular security functions or mechanisms are tested in the operational phase (Phase 7). The tests
can be initiated by the Smartcard Embedded Software and/or by the TOE or is done automatically and
continuously.
Part 2 of the Common Criteria provides the security functional component “TSF testing (FPT_TST.1)”. The
component FPT_TST.1 provides the ability to test the TSF’s correct operation.
For the user it is important to know which security functions or mechanisms can be tested. The functional
component FPT_TST.1 does not mandate to explicitly specify the security functions being tested. In addition,
FPT_TST.1 requires verification of the integrity of TSF data and of the stored TSF executable code which might
violate the security policy. Therefore, the functional component ”Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)” of
the family TSF self-test has been newly created. This component allows that particular parts of the security
mechanisms and functions provided by the TOE are tested.

 6.1.1        Definition of FPT_TST.2
The functional component “Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)” has been newly created (Common Criteria
Part 2 extended). This component allows that particular parts of the security mechanisms and functions provided
by the TOE can be tested after TOE Delivery or are tested automatically and continuously during normal
operation transparent for the user.
This security functional component is used instead of the functional component FPT_TST.1 from Common
Criteria Part 2. For the user it is important to know which security functions or mechanisms can be tested. The
functional component FPT_TST.1 does not mandate to explicitly specify the security functions being tested. In
addition, FPT_TST.1 requires verifying the integrity of TSF data and stored TSF executable code which might
violate the security policy.
The functional component “Subset TOE testing (FPT_TST.2)” is specified as follows (Common Criteria Part 2
extended).

   (1) Applies in two alternative operation modes: one mode preserves integrity protected communication and
       the second preserves integrity and confidential communication. Choosing the mode is up to the user and
       his responsibility. For example, the integrity protected mode can be used at secure premises, i.e. where
       eavesdropping is no issue, and the second mode can be applied where the environment is out of control
       of the user.

Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)


All assignments and selections of the security functional requirements of the TOE are done in PP [9] and in the
following description.
Notes:
      The security functional requirements valid for the ACL in all alternative versions ACL-1 to ACL-3 are
         FCS_CKM.1/EC, FCS_CKM.1/RSA, FCS_COP.1/ECDH, FCS_COP.1/ECDSA and FCS_COP.1/RSA. These
         SFRs apply only if the corresponding asymmetric cryptographic library is on bard.
      The security functional requirements FMT_LIM.1/Loader, FMT_LIM.2/Loader, FIA_API.1, FTP_ITC.1,
         FDP_UCT.1, FDP_UIT.1, FDP_ACC.1/Loader and FDP_ACF.1/Loader applying only at TOE products
         coming with activated Flash Loader enabled for user data download. In other cases the Flash Loader is
         not available anymore and the user data download is completed. Depending on the capabilities of the
         user software these security functional requirements may then reoccur as subject of the composite TOE.
      The security functional requirements FCS_COP.1/CCL, FCS_CKM.1/CCL, FCS_CKM.4/CCL apply only if
         the CCL is on board and if the operation mode confidential communication is chosen.


7.1.1          Extended Components FCS_RNG.1 and FAU_SAS.1

7.1.1.1        FCS_RNG
To define the IT security functional requirements of the TOE an additional family (FCS_RNG) of the Class FCS
(cryptographic support) is defined in the PP [9]. This family describes the functional requirements for random
number generation used for cryptographic purposes.

Please note that the national regulation are outlined in PP [9] chapter 7.5.1 and in AIS31 [13]. These regulations
apply for this TOE.

Note 12:
The functional requirements FCS_RNG.1/TRNG, FCS_RNG.1/HPRG, FCS_RNG.1/DRNG, FCS_RNG.1/KSG, are
iterations of the FCS_RNG.1 defined in the PP [9] according to “Anwendungshinweise und Interpretationen zum
Schema (AIS)” respectively “A proposal for: Functionality classes for random number generators” [13].
End of note.

Note 13:
The Physical True Random Number Generator PTRNG implements total failure test of the random source and a
continuous RNG test according to:
National Institute of Standards and Technology, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, Federal
Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS) 140-2, 2002-03-12, chapter 4.9.2.
End of note.

Together with the guidelines in [6] the hybrid PTRNG of this TOE provides random numbers conformant to
several quality metrics as defined in [13]. Depending on the user configuration the TOE provide the according
random number quality. For each addressed quality metric of [13] the definitions are made in the following
chapters.

                        applied seed shall have at least 100 bits of entropy, the internal state of the RNG shall
                        have at least the size of 200 bit – in this case the size of the internal state amounts to
                        351 bit, has the work factor for breaking the algorithm of 2127 due to the restriction on
