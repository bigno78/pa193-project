1.3 TOE Overview
The Security Target (ST) defines the security objectives and requirements for a
contact or contactless based chip of machine readable travel documents (MRTD)
based on the requirements and recommendations of the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO), EU requirements for biometric European passport
(Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 and Commission Implementing Decision
6181) and Biometric European Resident Permit (REGULATION (EU) 2017/1954
and Commission Implementing Decision 6178). This product is intended to
enable verification of the authenticity of the travel document and to identify its
holder during a border control, using an inspection system. The verification
process is based on Extended Access Control with Password Authenticated
Connection Establishment (PACE) and optionally Active Authentication (AA).

The main features and their origin are the following:
ï· Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
   according to ICAO Technical Report âSupplemental Access Controlâ [ICAO-
   9303] part 11 and strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0068-V2 [PACE-PP] for
   protection of the communication between terminal and chip. The following
   PACE mapping modes are supported and covered by the TOE:
      o    Generic Mapping (PACE-GM)
      o    Integrated Mapping (PACE-IM)
      o    Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM), which combines PACE-GM
           with Chip Authentication into a single protocol.

    according to BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1], [TR-03110-3] and
    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    travel documentâs chip to the inspection system.
ï·   Terminal Authentication v1
    according to BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1], [TR-03110-3] and
    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    inspection system to travel documentâs chip and protects the confidentiality
    and integrity of the sensitive biometric reference data during their
    transmission from the TOE to the inspection system.

As a feature that can be optionally configured the TOE supports:
ï·   Active Authentication
    which according to [ICAO-9303] prevents copying the SOD and proves that it
    has been read from the authentic chip. It proves that the chip has not been
    substituted.


ï·   Polymorphic Authentication
    which according to [PCA-eMRTD] provides additional privacy by randomisation
    of returned Polymorphic Identities, Polymorphic Pseudonyms and
    Complementary Polymorphic ID attributes in combination with standard ICAO
    and EAC1 eMRTD protocols specified in ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] and BSI
    TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1] and [TR 03110-3].

The TOE may also be used as an ISO driving license, compliant to ISO/IEC 18013
or ISO/IEC TR 19446 supporting PACE, AA and CA, as both applications (MRTD
and IDL) share the same protocols and data structure organization. Therefore, in
the rest of the document, the word âMRTDâ MAY be understood either as a MRTD
in the sense of ICAO, or a driving license compliant to ISO/IEC 18013 or ISO/IEC
TR 19446 depending on the targeted usage envisioned by the issuer.

Application note
This TOE claims an assurance level EAL5 augmented with AVA_VAN.5 and
ALC_DVS.2. AVA_VAN.5 implies that the TOE is resistant to attacks performed by
an attacker possessing "High attack potential".
Not all key sizes specified in this security target have sufficient cryptographic
strength for satisfying the AVA_VAN.5 âhigh attack potentialâ. In order to be
protected against attackers with a "high attack potential", sufficiently large
cryptographic key sizes SHALL be configured for this TOE. References can be
found in national and international document standards. Further details have
been specified in the TOEâs guidance documentation [AGD_PRE].

[TR-03110] have also been refered to in ISO18013 for EU driving licences. The
BAP-1 protocol defined in ISO18013 is equal to Basic Access Protocol (BAC)
defined in [ICAO-9303]. As to the logical data structure, the ISO18013 uses the
same concept of Passive Authentication defined in [ICAO-9303], but specifies
different ISO7816-4 elementary file identifiers for storing the ICAO defined
content of DG3, DG4 and DG15.

Polymorphic eMRTD.


1.4.2.1 ICAO/EAC eMRTD and ISO Driving licence
This sub section explains the TOE security features for operational use of TOE
configured as ICAO/EAC eMRTD or as Driving Licence.

A State or Organisation issues travel documents to be used by the holder for
international travel. The traveller presents a travel document to the inspection
system to prove his or her identity. The travel document in context of this
Security Target contains:
  I.  visual (eye readable) biographical data and portrait of the holder,
 II.  a separate data summary (MRZ data) for visual and machine reading using
       OCR methods in the Machine readable zone (MRZ) and
III.  data elements on the travel documentâs chip according to LDS in case of
       contactless machine reading.

The authentication of the traveller is based on:
  I.  the possession of a valid travel document personalized for a holder with
      the claimed identity as given on the biographical data page and
 II.  biometrics using the reference data stored in the travel document.

                              eMRTD Configuration)


The issuing State or Organization ensures the authenticity of the data of genuine
travel documents. The receiving State trusts a genuine travel document of an
issuing State or Organization.

For this Security Target the travel document is viewed as unit of:
(i) the physical part of the travel document in form of paper and/or plastic
    and chip. It presents visual readable data including (but not limited to)
    personal data of the travel document holder
    (a) the biographical data on the biographical data page of the travel
         document surface,
    (b) the printed data in the Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) and
    (c) the printed portrait.

(ii) the logical travel document as data of the travel document holder stored
     according to the Logical Data Structure as defined in [ICAO-9303] as specified
     by ICAO on the contact based or contactless integrated circuit. It presents
     contact based / contactless readable data including(but not limited to)
     personal data of the travel document holder
     (a) the digital Machine Readable Zone Data (digital MRZ data, EF.DG1),
     (b) the digitized portraits (EF.DG2),
     (c) the biometric reference data of finger(s) (EF.DG3) or iris image(s)
          (EF.DG4) or both1,
     (d) the other data according to LDS (EF.DG5 to EF.DG16) and
     (e) the Document Security Object (SOD).


The issuing State or Organisation implements security features of the travel
document to maintain the authenticity and integrity of the travel document and
their data. The physical part of the travel document and the travel documentâs
chip are identified by the Document Number.

The physical part of the travel document is protected by physical security
measures (e.g. watermark, security printing), logical (e.g. authentication keys of
the travel documentâs chip) and organisational security measures (e.g. control of
materials, personalisation procedures) [ICAO-9303].These security measures can
include the binding of the travel documentâs chip to the travel document.

The logical travel document is protected in authenticity and integrity by a digital
signature created by the document signer acting for the issuing State or
Organisation and the security features of the travel documentâs chip.

The ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] defines the baseline security methods Passive
Authentication, advanced security access methods Basic Access Control (BAC)
and Password Authenticated Connection Establishment to the logical travel



These biometric reference data are optional according to [ICAO-9303]. This ST assumes that the issuing State or
1

Organisation uses this option and protects these data by means of extended access control.

document, Active Authentication of the travel documentâs chip, Extended Access
Control and the Data Encryption of sensitive biometrics as optional security
measure. The Passive Authentication Mechanism is performed completely and
independently of the TOE by the TOE environment.

The BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1] and [TR 03110-3] specify the
Extended Access Control protocols Chip Authentication version 1 (CAv1) and
Terminal Authentication (TAv1), which are required to get secured access to the
biometric data stored in data groups DG3 and DG4 in combination with PACE or
BAC.

This Security Target addresses the protection of the logical travel document:
   (i) in integrity by write-only-once access control and by physical means, and
   (ii) in confidentiality by the Extended Access Control Mechanism.

This Security Target addresses the Chip Authentication Version 1 described in
[TR-03110-1] and PACE-CAM described in [ICAO-9303] part 11 as an alternative
to the Active Authentication stated in [ICAO-9303].

For Basic Access Control (BAC) supported by the product, a separate evaluation
and certification is performed with ST [ST-BAC].

The confidentiality by Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
is a mandatory security feature of the TOE. The travel document shall strictly
conform to the âCommon Criteria Protection Profile Machine Readable Travel
Document using Standard Inspection Procedure with PACE [PACE-PP]. Note that
[PACE-PP] considers high attack potential.

For the PACE protocol according to [ICAO-9303] part 11, the following steps shall
be performed:
 (i) the travel document's chip encrypts a nonce with the shared password,
       derived from the MRZ resp. CAN data and transmits the encrypted nonce
       together with the domain parameters to the terminal.
 (ii) The terminal recovers the nonce using the shared password, by
       (physically) reading the MRZ or CAN data. This nonce shall be converted to
       a group generator using one of the following mapping algorithms, which
       maps a static generator to an ephemeral generator:
           a. Generic mapping (PACE-GM) or
           b. Integrated mapping PACE-IM)
 (iii) The travel document's chip and terminal computer perform a Diffie-
       Hellmann key agreement together with the ephemeral domain parameters
       to create a shared secret. Both parties derive the session keys KMAC and
       KENC from the shared secret.
 (iv) Each party generates an authentication token, sends it to the other party
       and verifies the received token.

In case of PACE with Chip Authenticated Mapping (PACE-CAM), in addition to the
steps above executed for the PACE-GM variant, the MRTD chip computes Chip
Authentication Data CAIC, encrypts them AIC = E(KSEnc, CAIC) and sends them

to the terminal. The terminal decrypts AIC and verifies the authenticity of the
chip using the recovered Chip Authentication Data CAIC.

After successful key negotiation, the terminal and the travel document's chip
provide private communication (secure messaging) [TR-03110-1], [ICAO-9303].

This Security Target requires the TOE to implement the Extended Access Control
as defined in [TR-03110-1]. The Extended Access Control consists of two parts:
  (i) the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1 and
  (ii) the Terminal Authentication Protocol Version 1 (v.1).

The Chip Authentication Protocol v.1
  (i) authenticates the travel documentâs chip to the inspection system and
  (ii) establishes secure messaging which is used by Terminal Authentication v.1
       to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the sensitive biometric
       reference data during their transmission from the TOE to the inspection
       system. Therefore Terminal Authentication v.1 can only be performed if
       Chip Authentication v.1has been successfully executed.

The Terminal Authentication Protocolv.1 consists of
  (i) the authentication of the inspection system as entity authorized by the
       receiving State or Organisation through the issuing State, and
  (ii) an access control by the TOE to allow reading the sensitive biometric
       reference data only to successfully authenticated authorized inspection
       systems.

The Active Authentication protocol may be optionally configured during
personalisation.

The issuing State or Organisation authorizes the receiving State by means of
certification the authentication public keys of Document Verifiers who create
Inspection System Certificates.


1.4.2.2 Polymorphic eMRTD

In addition to an ICAO/EAC eMRTD functionality, the TOE supports Polymorphic
eMRTD extensions that can be configured using the same applet during
personalisation. The TOEâs Polymorphic eMRTD extensions enable secure
authentication with enhanced privacy protection features. The Polymorphic
extensions provide the holder the possibility to authenticate towards a service
provider using an authentication service in a non-traceable and non-linkable
manner thanks to usage of Polymorphic ID attributes.

The Polymorphic extensions are used to configure a Polymorphic eMRTD as stand
alone application instance or next to an ICAO/EAC eMRTD/Driving application
licence instance having its own application identifier during personalisation.

                        eMRTD Configuration)

The Polymorphic eMRTD uses the same ICAO and EAC1 protocols like PACEv2,
Chip Authentication v1 (CAv1) and Terminal Authentication (v1) as defined in
[ICAO-9303], [TR-03110-1] and [TR-03110-3]. The TOEâs Polymorphic eMRTD
extensions provide the following features:

   ï·   Secure storage of the Polymorphic ID attributes during personalisation or
       the TOE.
   ï·   Polymorphic Authentication Protocol (PMA) for authenticated access with
       user consent, randomization and secure readout of the Polymorphic ID
       attributes, in combination with PACEv2 and EAC1 eMRTD protocols.
   ï·   PACEv2 protocol extended with PIN and PUK passwords, to enforce user
       authentication (document holder verification) in compliance with [TR-
       03101-3].

For Polymorphic eMRTD, the PACE protocol is configured with PIN, PUK and CAN
passwords in compliance with [TR-03110-3] during personalisation. Only PACE-
GM and PACE-IM are configurable for a Polymorphic eMRTD.

The Active Authentication protocol shall not be configured for a polymorphic
eMRTD.

The logical data structure consists only of EF.CVCA, DG14 and EF.SOD. In order
to assure a sufficient level of privacy during authentication the CAv1 private key
and EF.SOD are shared amoung a sufficient high number of personalised
Polymorphic eMRTDs, i.e. the logical data structure does not contain any unique
identifiable data.



1.4.3 TOE life cycle
The TOE life cycle is described in terms of its four life cycle phases. (With respect
to the [SIC-PP], the TOE life-cycle is additionally subdivided into 7 steps in the
ST. These steps are denoted too in the following although the sequence of the
steps differs for the TOE life cycle).

1.4.3.1 Phase 1 âDevelopmentâ
(Step1) The TOE is developed in phase 1. The IC developer develops the
integrated circuit, the IC Dedicated Software and the guidance documentation
associated with these TOE components.
The IC developer also acts as the developer of the embedded software (operating
system), which is the NXP JCOP 3 P60.

(Step2) The software developer uses the guidance documentation for the
integrated circuit and the guidance documentation for relevant parts of the NXP
JCOP 3 P60 and develops the ePassport application and the guidance
documentation associated with this TOE component.

The ePassport application (i.e. the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
(SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet run time code) may be
integrated either in ROM or in EEPROM of the chip. Depending on the intention:
      (a) the ePassport application is securely delivered directly from the
          software developer (IDEMIA development dept.) to the IC manufacturer
          (NXP). The applet code will be integrated into the ROM mask code or
          inEEPROM by the IC manufacturer, or
      (b) the ePassport application is securely delivered directly from the
          software developer (IDEMIA development dept.) to the travel document
          manufacturer (IDEMIA production dept.) .) for loading in EEPROM.

Notice that the guidance documentation of the ePassport application is always
securely delivered directly from the software developer (IDEMIA development
dept.) to the travel document manufacturer (IDEMIA production dept.).


1.4.3.2 Phase 2 âManufacturingâ
(Step3) In a first step the TOE integrated circuit is produced containing the travel
documentâs chip Dedicated Software, the parts of the travel documentâs chip
Embedded Software and in case of alternative a) the ePassport application in
ROM or in EEPROM.

The IC manufacturer writes the IC Identification Data onto the chip to control the
IC as travel document material during the IC manufacturing and the delivery
process to the travel document manufacturer. The IC is securely delivered from
the IC manufacturer to the travel document manufacturer.

If necessary the IC manufacturer adds the parts of the IC Embedded Software in
the non-volatile programmable memories (for instance EEPROM).

(Step4 optional) The travel document manufacturer combines the IC with
hardware for the contact based / contactless interface in the travel document
unless the travel document consist of the chip only.

(Step5) The travel document manufacturer
  i.  adds the IC Embedded Software or part of it in the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM) if necessary and in case
      of alternative (b), loads the ePassport application into the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM),
 ii.      creates the ePassport application and
iii.      equips travel documentâs chips with pre-personalization Data.

EAC PP Application Note 1: Creation of the application for this TOE implies
Applet instantiation.

For this Security Target the following name mappings to the protection profile
[EAC-PP-V2] apply:
   ï· IC Dedicated SW = Low level IC libraries
   ï· travel documentâs chip Embedded Software = NXP JCOP 3 P60 operating
       system.
   ï· ePassport application = IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
       (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet run time code or an
       instantiation of it.
   ï· Pre-personalization Data = Personalization Agent Key Set, Card Production
       Life Cycle (CPLC) data and buffer settings.

Both the underlying platform and IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
(SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet provide configuration and
life-cycle management functions required for TOE preparation. TOE preparation
steps are performed in manufacturing phase and consist of the following 2
activities:
    1. Platform initialisation
       2. Pre-personalisation

Platform initialisation
Platform initialisation consists of the configuration of the NXP JCOP 3 P60 in
accordance with requirements specified in the platform administrator guidance
[PLTF-PRE] by using the dedicated platform commands. Furthermore the Pre-
Personalisation Agent key set is installed and (a part of) the CPLC data is
updated. To prevent unattended tracing of the MRTD document, the NXP JCOP 3
P60 is configured such that unauthenticated access to any platform unique
idenfiable data is not possible.

      personalisation key set.
   b. [optional] In case the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
      (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet runtime code does
      not reside in ROM, it is loaded into EEPROM.
   c. Install the applet application instances depending on the desired TOE
      configuration specified in section 1.4.2, using IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with
      Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet.
   d. Set the ePassport (and if present) the Polymorphic eMRTD applet
      irreversibly in its PERSONALISATION life-cycle state by installation of the
      Personalisation Agent specific personalisation key set(s).

During step (c) the CPLC data with the IC Identifier as well as the other pre-
personalisation data is configured in the TOE. The last step (d) finalizes the TOE.
This is the moment the TOE starts to exist and is ready for delivery to the
Personalisation Agent. The guidance documentation for the Personalisation Agent
is [AGD_PRE].

The pre-personalised travel document together with the IC Identifier is securely
delivered from the travel document manufacturer to the Personalisation Agent.
The travel document manufacturer also provides the relevant parts of the
guidance documentation [AGD_PRE] and [AGD_OPE] and the Personalisation
Agent Key set to the Personalisation Agent. The following table describes the
physical delivery of the TOE components:

1.4.3.3 Phase 3 âPersonalisation of the travel documentâ
(Step 6) The personalisation of the travel document includes
  i.  the survey of the MRTD holderâs biographical data,
 ii.   the enrolment of the MRTD holder biometric reference data (i.e. the
       digitized portraits and the optional biometric reference data),
iii.   the printing of the visual readable data onto the physical MRTD,
iv.    the writing of the TOE User Data and TSF Data into the logical MRTD and
 v.    configuration of the TSF if necessary.

The step (iv) is performed by the Personalisation Agent and includes but is not
limited to the creation of:
  i.   the digital MRZ data (EF.DG1),
 ii.   the digitized portrait (EF.DG2), and
iii.   the Document security object.

The signing of the Document security object by the Document signer [ICAO-
9303] finalizes the personalisation of the genuine travel document for the travel
document holder. The personalised travel document (together with appropriate
guidance (AGD_OPE) for TOE usage if necessary) is handed over to the travel
document holder for operational use.

The personalisation of Polymorphic eMRTD application instance includes:

 i.    establishing the identity of the polymorphic eMRTD document holder,
 ii.   Requesting the required Polymorphic eMRTD ID attributes from the central
       Key Management authority,
iii.   writing Polymorphic ID attributes, Polymorphic LDS data as defined in
       [PCA-eMRTD],
iv.    writing the TSF data (PIN, PUK, CAv1 private key) as defined in [PCA-
       eMRTD],
 v.    signing the Document Security Object defined in
       [ICAO-9303] (in the role of DS).


The signing of the Document security object by the Document signer [ICAO-
9303] finalizes the personalisation of the genuine Polymorphic eMRTD document
for the travel document holder. The personalised Polymorphic eMRTD document
(together with appropriate guidance (AGD_OPE) for TOE usage if necessary) is
handed over to the Polymorphic eMRTD document holder for operational use.

Private Key.

EAC PP Application note 3: This ST distinguishes between the Personalisation
Agent as entity known to the TOE and the Document Signer as entity in the TOE
IT environment signing the Document security object as described in [ICAO-
9303]. This approach allows but does not enforce the separation of these roles.


1.4.3.4 Phase 4 âOperational Useâ
(Step 7) The TOE is used as a travel document's chip by the traveller and the
inspection systems in the âOperational Useâ phase. The user data can be read
according to the security policy of the issuing State or Organisation and can be
used according to the security policy of the issuing State but they can never be
modified.

EAC PP Application note 42: The intention of the ST is to consider at least the
phases 1 and parts of phase 2 (i.e. Step1 to Step3) as part of the evaluation and
therefore to define the TOE delivery according to CC after this phase. Since
specific production steps of phase 2 are of minor security relevance (e.g. booklet
manufacturing and antenna integration) these are not part of the CC evaluation
under ALC. Nevertheless the decision about this has to be taken by the
certification body resp. the national body of the issuing State or Organisation. In
this case the national body of the issuing State or Organisation is responsible for
these specific production steps.
Note that the personalisation process and its environment may depend on
specific security needs of an issuing State or Organisation. All production,
generation and installation procedures after TOE delivery up to the âOperational
Useâ (phase 4) have to be considered in the product evaluation process under
AGD assurance class. Therefore, the Security Target outlines the split up of
P.Manufact, P.Personalisation and the related security objectives into aspects
relevant before vs. after TOE delivery.


1.4.3.5 Non-TOE hardware/software/firmware required by the TOE
There is no explicit non-TOE hardware, software or firmware required by the TOE
to perform its claimed security features. The TOE is defined to comprise the chip
and the complete operating system and application. Note, the inlay holding the
chip as well as the antenna and the booklet (holding the printed MRZ) are
needed to represent a complete travel document. Nevertheless, these parts are
not inevitable for the secure operation of the TOE.




2
 For this ST all steps of both phase 1 and phase 2 are part of the evaluation and therefore define the TOE
delivery according to the CC evaluation after this phase.

2.3 Package Claim
This ST is conforming to assurance package EAL5 augmented with ALC_DVS.2
and AVA_VAN.5 defined in CC part 3 [CC-3].


2.4 PP Conformance Rationale
This ST claims strict conformance to [EAC-PP-V2]. According to hints in [EAC-PP-
V2] parts of the [PACE-PP] have been included into this ST. A detailed
justification is given in the following.


2.4.1 Main aspects
-   The TOE description (chapter 1.3) is based on the TOE definition and TOE
    usage of [EAC-PP, 1.1]. It was enhanced by product specific details.

-   All definitions of the security problem definition in [EAC-PP, 3] have been
    taken exactly from the protection profile in the same wording.

-   All security objectives have been taken exactly from [EAC-PP, 4] in the same
    wording, except for OT.Chip_Auth_Proof which is enhanced to support
    Active Authentication.

-   The part of extended components definition has been taken originally from
    [EAC-PP, 5].

-   All SFRs for the TOE have been taken originally from the [EAC-PP, 6.1] added
    by according iterations, selections and assignments.

-   The security assurance requirements (SARs) have been taken originally from
    the EAC-PP. The requirements are shifted to those of EAL 5+.


2.4.2 Overview of differences between the PP and the ST

The Active Authentication has been added to the TOE. For that:
- One assumption has been added to cover Active Authentication during
   personalization: A.Pers_Agent_AA
- Two security objectives for the environment have been added:
   OE.Auth_Key_MRTD and OE.AA_MRTD. These additions to the original
   objectives of the PP do not contradict with any other objective nor mitigate a
   threat (or part of a threat) meant to be addressed by security objectives for
   the TOE in the PP.
- Three security functional requirements have been added:
             ï· FCS_COP.1/SIG_GEN
             ï·   FIA_API.1/AA
             ï·   FMT_MTD.1/AAPK

                        eMRTD Configuration)

The additional functionality of Password Authenticated Connection Establishment
with Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM) has been added to the TOE. It
possesses the same security requirements as the PACE functionality, which
means that the same security problem definition is applicable for PACE-CAM.


The following additional SFRs have been defined for PACE-CAM:
             ï· FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM
             ï·   FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM
             ï·   FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM
             ï·   FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM
             ï·   FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM
             ï·   FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ
             ï·   FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_WRITE




The additional functionality of the Polymorphic eMRTD extensions has been
added to the TOE with: (i) additional security problem definition; (ii) additional
security objectives; (iii) additional SFRs. Notice that many SFRs are included
from the [EACv2-PP].

                           eneral support for cryptographic operations needed.

OT.Data_Authenticity The security objective OT.Data_Authenticity aims
  ensuring authenticity of the User- and TSF data (after the PACE
  Authentication) by enabling its verification at the terminal-side and by an
  active verification by the TOE itself. This objective is mainly achieved by
  FTP_ITC.1/PACE using FCS_COP.1/PACE_MAC. A prerequisite for establishing
  this trusted channel is a successful PACE or Chip and Terminal Authentication
  v.1       FIA_UID.1/PACE,       FIA_UAU.1/PACE        (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM,
  FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) using FCS_CKM.1/DH_PACE resp.
  FCS_CKM.1/CA and possessing the special properties FIA_UAU.5/PACE,
  FIA_UAU.6/PACE (FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM, FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM for PACE
  CAM) resp. FIA_UAU.6/EAC. FDP_RIP.1 requires erasing the values of session
  keys (here: for KMAC). FIA_UAU.4/PACE, FIA_UAU.5/PACE and FCS_CKM.4
  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM, FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM and FCS_CKM.4 for PACE
  CAM) represent some required specific properties of the protocols used. The
  SFR FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords, the
  Chip Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication Private Key. The
  SFR FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE
  passwords and the modular invert of the CA key. FMT_MTD.1/PA requires that
  SOD containing signature over the User Data stored on the TOE and used for
  the Passive Authentication is allowed to be written by the Personalisation
  Agent only and, hence, is to be considered as trustworthy. The SFR
  FCS_RND.1 represents a general support for cryptographic operations needed.
  The SFRs FMT_SMF.1 and FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles
  related.

OT.Data_Confidentiality The security objective OT.Data_Confidentiality aims
  that the TOE always ensures confidentiality of the User- and TSF-data stored
  and, after the PACE Authentication resp. Chip Authentication, of these data
  exchanged. This objective for the data stored is mainly achieved by

  (FDP_ACC.1/TRM, FDP_ACF.1/TRM). FIA_UAU.4/PACE, FIA_UAU.5/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM,        FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM      for   PACE    CAM)    and
  FCS_CKM.4 represent some required specific properties of the protocols used.
  This objective for the data exchanged is mainly achieved by FDP_UCT.1/TRM,
  FDP_UIT.1/TRM and FTP_ITC.1/PACE using FCS_COP.1/PACE_ENC resp.
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC. A prerequisite for establishing this trusted channel is a
  successful PACE or Chip and Terminal Authentication v.1 FIA_UID.1/PACE,
  FIA_UAU.1/PACE (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM, FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE
  CAM) using FCS_CKM.1/DH_PACE resp. FCS_CKM.1/CA and possessing the
  special properties FIA_UAU.5/PACE, FIA_UAU.6/PACE (FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM,
  FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) resp. FIA_UAU.6/EAC. FDP_RIP.1
  requires erasing the values of session keys (here: for Kenc). The SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords, the Chip
  Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication Private Key. The SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords
  and the modular invert of the CA key. FMT_MTD.1/PA requires that SOD
  containing signature over the User Data stored on the TOE and used for the
  Passive Authentication is allowed to be written by the Personalisation Agent
  only and, hence, is to be considered trustworthy. The SFR FCS_RND.1
  represents the general support for cryptographic operations needed. The SFRs
  FMT_SMF.1 and FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related.

OT.Tracing The security objective OT.Tracing aims that the TOE prevents
  gathering TOE tracing data by means of unambiguous identifying the travel
  document remotely through establishing or listening to a communication via
  the contactless/contact-based interface of the TOE without a priori knowledge
  of the correct values of shared passwords (CAN, MRZ, PIN, PUK). This
  objective is achieved as follows:
            1. While establishing PACE communication with CAN, MRZ or PUK
                (non-blocking      authentication /   authorization  data)   by
                FIA_AFL.1/PACE,
            2. while establishing PACE communication using the PIN (blocking
                authentication data) by FIA_AFL.1/Block_PIN,
            3. for listening to PACE communication and for establishing CAv1
                communication by FTP_ITC.1/PACE,
            4. and      for     listening     to  CAv1     communication     by
                FTP_ITC.1/Polymorphic. The trusted channel shall be established
                by performing the PACE, CAv1 and TAv1 protocols according to
                [TR03110TR-03110] and the Polymorphic Authentication protocol
                (PMA).

OT.Prot_Abuse-Func The security objective OT.Prot_Abuse-Func âProtection
  against Abuse of Functionalityâ is ensured by the SFRs FMT_LIM.1, FMT_LIM.2,
  FMT_LIM.1/POLY and FMT_LIM.2/POLY which prevent misuse of test
  functionality of the TOE or other features which may not be used after TOE
  Delivery.

OT.Prot_Inf_Leak The security objective OT.Prot_Inf_Leak âProtection against
  Information Leakageâ requires the TOE to protect confidential TSF data stored
  and/or processed in the travel documentâs chip against disclosure
      by measurement and analysis of the shape and amplitude of signals or the
        time between events found by measuring signals on the electromagnetic
        field, power consumption, clock, or I/O lines which is addressed by the
        SFR FPT_EMS.1,
      by forcing a malfunction of the TOE which is addressed by the SFR
        FPT_FLS.1 and FPT_TST.1, and/or
      by a physical manipulation of the TOE which is addressed by the SFR
        FPT_PHP.3.

OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper The security objective OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper âProtection
  against Physical Tamperingâ is covered by the SFR FPT_PHP.3.

OT.Prot_Malfunction The security objective OT.Prot_Malfunction âProtection
  against Malfunctionsâ is covered by (i) the SFR FPT_TST.1 which requires self-
  tests to demonstrate the correct operation and tests of authorized users to
  verify the integrity of TSF data and TSF code, and (ii) the SFRFPT_FLS.1 which
  requires a secure state in case of detected failure or operating conditions
  possibly causing a malfunction.

OT.Identification The security objective OT.Identification âIdentification of the
  TOEâ addresses the storage of Initialisation and Pre-Personalisation Data in its
  non-volatile memory, whereby they also include the IC Identification Data
  uniquely identifying the TOEâs chip. This will be ensured by TSF according to
  SFR FAU_SAS.1. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA allows only the Manufacturer
  to write Initialisation and Pre-personalisation Data (including the
  Personalisation Agent key set). The SFR FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS requires the
  Personalisation Agent to disable access to Initialisation and Pre-personalisation
  Data in the life cycle phase âoperational useâ. The SFRs FMT_SMF.1 and
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related.

OT.AC_Pers The       security   objective  OT.AC_Pers      âAccess   Control   for
  Personalisation of logical travel documentâ addresses the access control of the
  writing the logical travel document. The justification for the SFRs FAU_SAS.1,
  FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA and FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS arises from the justification for
  OT.Identification above with respect to the Pre-personalisation Data. The write
  access to the logical travel document data are defined by the SFR
  FIA_UID.1/PACE (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM), FIA_UAU.1/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM), FDP_ACC.1/TRM and FDP_ACF.1/TRM
  in the same way: only the successfully authenticated Personalisation Agent is
  allowed to write the data of the groups EF.DG1 to EF.DG16 of the logical travel
  document only once. FMT_MTD.1/PA covers the related property of
  OT.AC_Pers (writing SOD and, in generally, personalization data). The SFR
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE lists the roles (including Personalisation Agent) and the SFR
  FMT_SMF.1 lists the TSF management functions (including Personalisation).

  The SFRs FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ (FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ for
  PACE CAM protocol) and FPT_EMS.1 restrict the access to the Personalisation
  Agent Keys, the Chip Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication
  Private key. The authentication of the terminal as Personalisation Agent shall
  be performed by TSF according to SFRs FIA_UAU.4/PACE and FIA_UAU.5/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM and FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). If the
  Personalisation Terminal wants to authenticate itself to the TOE by means of
  the Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 (after Chip Authentication v.1) with
  the Personalisation Agent Keys, the TOE will use TSF according to the
  FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the challenge), FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the
  derivation of the new session keys after Chip Authentication v.1), and
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC (for the ENC_MAC_Mode secure
  messaging), FCS_COP.1/SIG_VER (as part of the Terminal Authentication
  Protocol v.1) and FIA_UAU.6/EAC (for the re-authentication). If the
  Personalisation Terminal wants to authenticate itself to the TOE by means of
  the Authentication Mechanism with the Personalisation Agent Key, the TOE will
  use TSF according to the FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the challenge) and
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC (to verify the authentication attempt). The session keys
  are destroyed according to FCS_CKM.4 after use.

OT.Sens_Data_Conf The            security     objective      OT.Sense_Data_Confâ
  Confidentiality of sensitive biometric reference dataâ is enforced by the Access
  Control SFP defined in FDP_ACC.1/TRM and FDP_ACF.1/TRM allowing the data
  of EF.DG3 and EF.DG4 only to be read by successfully authenticated Extended
  Inspection System being authorized by a valid certificate according
  FCS_COP.1/SIG_VER. The SFRs FIA_UID.1/PACE and FIA_UAU.1/PACE
  (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM and FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) require the
  identification and authentication of the inspection systems. The SFR
  FIA_UAU.5/PACE requires the successful Chip Authentication (CA) v.1 before
  any     authentication    attempt   as    Extended     Inspection  System    (or
  FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). During the protected communication
  following the CA v.1 the reuse of authentication data is prevented by
  FIA_UAU.4/PACE (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). The SFR
  FIA_UAU.6/EAC and FDP_UCT.1/TRM requires the confidentiality protection of
  the transmitted data after Chip Authentication v.1 by means of secure
  messaging implemented by the cryptographic functions according to
  FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the terminal authentication challenge),
  FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the generation of shared secret and for the derivation of
  the new session keys), and FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC for
  the ENC_MAC_Mode secure messaging. The session keys are destroyed
  according to FCS_CKM.4 after use. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/CAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ requires that the Chip Authentication Key cannot be
  written unauthorized or read afterwards. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/AAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ requires that the Active Authentication Key cannot be
  written       unauthorized       or      read      afterwards.      The     SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_WRITE and FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ

OT.Chip_Auth_Proof The security objective OT.Chip_Auth_Proof âProof of
  travel documentâs chip authenticityâ is ensured by the Chip Authentication
  Protocolv.1 provided by FIA_API.1/CA and by Active Authentication provided
  by FIA_API.1/AA proving the identity of the TOE. The Chip Authentication
  Protocolv.1 defined by FCS_CKM.1/CA is performed using a TOE internally
  stored confidential private key as required by FMT_MTD.1/CAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ. The Chip Authentication Protocolv.1 [TR-03110-1]
  requires additional TSF according to FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the derivation of the
  session keys), FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC (for the
  ENC_MAC_Mode        secure    messaging).    The   SFRs     FMT_SMF.1     and
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related. The Active
  Authentication defined by FCS_COP.1/SIG_GEN for the generation of the RSA
  Signature is performed using a TOE internally stored confidential private key
  as required by FMT_MTD.1/AAPK and FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ. According to
  FDP_ACF.1, only the successfully authenticated Inspection Systems are
  allowed to request active authentication (FDP_ACF.1.2, rule 2).

6.3.3.1.1 Rationale for the exclusion of Dependencies


The dependency FMT_MSA.3 of FDP_ACF.1/TRM is discarded. The access
  control TSF according to FDP_ACF.1/TRM uses security attributes which are
  defined during the personalisation and are fixed over the whole life time of the
  TOE. No management of these security attribute (i.e. SFR FMT_MSA.1 and
  FMT_MSA.3) is necessary here.

6.3.4 Rationale for the Security Assurance Requirements
The EAL5 was chosen to permits a developer to gain maximum assurance from
positive security engineering based upon rigorous commercial development
practices supported by moderate application of specialist security engineering
techniques. Such a TOE will probably be designed and developed with the intent
of achieving EAL5 assurance. It is likely that the additional costs attributable to
the EAL5 requirements, relative to rigorous development without the application
of specialised techniques, will not be large.

                       eMRTD Configuration)

7.1.2 SF.CF Cryptographic functions support
Cryptographic function support is provided by the underlying NXP JCOP 3 P60,
i.e. the TOE relies on the underlying platform for performing its required
cryptographic operations.

SF.CF Cryptographic functions include:
     ï·   SF.CF.1: 3DES and AES cipher operations for secure messaging
     ï·   SF.CF.2: Digest calculations (SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and
         SHA-512)
     ï·   SF.CF.3: Signature generation (ECDSA, RSA)
     ï·   SF.CF.4: Signature verification (ECDSA, RSA)
     ï·   SF.CF.5: Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement (ECDH and DH)
     ï·   SF.CF.6: Key Generation (PACE ECDH/DH ephemeral keys and secure
         messaging MAC and ENC session keys)

     ï·   SF.CF.8: True Random Number generation
     ï·   SF.CF.9: Randomization of PI/PP/CPI data as part of the Polymorphic
         Authentication protocol (PMA)




7.1.3 SF.ILTB Protection against interference, logical tampering
and bypass

SF.ILTB.1
  Protection against interference, logical tampering and bypass
  Security domains are supported by the Java Card platform used by the TOE
  underlying NXP JCOP 3 P60. The NXP JCOP 3 P60 provides protection against
  physical attack and performs self-tests as described in [PLTF-ST].
  The platform protects the TOE against malfunctions that are caused by
  exposure to operating conditions that may cause a malfunction. This includes
  hardware resets and operation outside the specified norms.
  The IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic
  eMRTD Configuration) Applet uses transient memory where a hardware reset
  always reverts the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
  (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet into an unauthenticated
  state.

7.1.4 SF.AC Access control / Storage and protection of logical
travel document data

SF.AC.1
  Access control / Storage and protection of logical travel document
  data
  The TOE provided access control, storage and protection of logical travel
  document data including access control to MRTD data. The TOE implements
  the subjects, objects, security attributes and rules according to the security
  attribute based access control. Access control is enforced by the APDU
  methods as specified in the interface defined in the functional specification.

7.1.5 SF.SM Secure Messaging

SF.SM.1
  Secure Messaging
  Secure messaging MAC and ENC operations are performed by the TOEâs
  platform.
  Secure messaging in ENC_MAC mode is established during PACE or re-
  established during Chip Authentication v1 and is based on SF.CF.1, 5, 6 and 8.

SF.SM.2
  Secure Messaging â Re-authentication
  The Retail MAC for 3DES and CMAC for AES are part of every APDU
  command/response when secure messaging is active after a successful PACE
  or Chip Authentication has been accomplished. Re-authentication after reset of
  the SM protocol is assured by accepting only valid (mandatory) MAC or CMAC
  cryptograms.

7.1.6 SF.LCM Security and life cycle management

SF.LCM.1
  Management of phases and roles
  For the TOE the following life-cycle phases have been identified:
      1. Manufacturing phase
      2. Personalisation phase
      3. Operational phase
      4. Termination phase
  Each life-cycle phase (or state) has its typical user acting as role holder.

                           Polymorphic eMRTD document holder
Terminated phase           None

  All role holders in Manufacturing, Pre-Personalisation and Personalisation
  phases are identified by cryptographic authentication keys. In Operational
  phase the PACE password is required to authenticate the Basic or Extended
  Inspection System in order to get access to the non-sensitive ICAO LDS
  datagroups.
  The IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic
  eMRTD Configuration) Applet maintains the internal life-cycle state the
  moment that the applet is installed. This state, together with the access
  control mechanisms force the Terminal into a specific role, for the pre-
  personalisation and subsequent, personalisation and operational phases. The
  phases (and corresponding life-cycle states) are controlled by APDU
  commands.



SF.LCM.2
  Life Cycle states of the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
  (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet
  The TOE supports the following life-cycle states:
      1. Not instantiated (applet resides in ROM or in EEPROM)
      2. PRE-PERSONALISATION state
      3. PERSONALISATION state
      4. OPERATIONAL state

6.3.3.1.1 Rationale for the exclusion of Dependencies


The dependency FMT_MSA.3 of FDP_ACF.1/TRM is discarded. The access
  control TSF according to FDP_ACF.1/TRM uses security attributes which are
  defined during the personalisation and are fixed over the whole life time of the
  TOE. No management of these security attribute (i.e. SFR FMT_MSA.1 and
  FMT_MSA.3) is necessary here.

6.3.4 Rationale for the Security Assurance Requirements
The EAL5 was chosen to permits a developer to gain maximum assurance from
positive security engineering based upon rigorous commercial development
practices supported by moderate application of specialist security engineering
techniques. Such a TOE will probably be designed and developed with the intent
of achieving EAL5 assurance. It is likely that the additional costs attributable to
the EAL5 requirements, relative to rigorous development without the application
of specialised techniques, will not be large.

                       eMRTD Configuration)

7.1.2 SF.CF Cryptographic functions support
Cryptographic function support is provided by the underlying NXP JCOP 3 P60,
i.e. the TOE relies on the underlying platform for performing its required
cryptographic operations.

SF.CF Cryptographic functions include:
     ï·   SF.CF.1: 3DES and AES cipher operations for secure messaging
     ï·   SF.CF.2: Digest calculations (SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and
         SHA-512)

7.1.3 SF.ILTB Protection against interference, logical tampering
and bypass

SF.ILTB.1
  Protection against interference, logical tampering and bypass
  Security domains are supported by the Java Card platform used by the TOE
  underlying NXP JCOP 3 P60. The NXP JCOP 3 P60 provides protection against
  physical attack and performs self-tests as described in [PLTF-ST].
  The platform protects the TOE against malfunctions that are caused by
  exposure to operating conditions that may cause a malfunction. This includes
  hardware resets and operation outside the specified norms.
  The IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic
  eMRTD Configuration) Applet uses transient memory where a hardware reset
  always reverts the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
  (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet into an unauthenticated
  state.

7.1.4 SF.AC Access control / Storage and protection of logical
travel document data

SF.AC.1
  Access control / Storage and protection of logical travel document
  data
  The TOE provided access control, storage and protection of logical travel
  document data including access control to MRTD data. The TOE implements
  the subjects, objects, security attributes and rules according to the security
  attribute based access control. Access control is enforced by the APDU
  methods as specified in the interface defined in the functional specification.

7.1.5 SF.SM Secure Messaging

SF.SM.1
  Secure Messaging
  Secure messaging MAC and ENC operations are performed by the TOEâs
  platform.
  Secure messaging in ENC_MAC mode is established during PACE or re-
  established during Chip Authentication v1 and is based on SF.CF.1, 5, 6 and 8.

SF.SM.2
  Secure Messaging â Re-authentication
  The Retail MAC for 3DES and CMAC for AES are part of every APDU
  command/response when secure messaging is active after a successful PACE
  or Chip Authentication has been accomplished. Re-authentication after reset of
  the SM protocol is assured by accepting only valid (mandatory) MAC or CMAC
  cryptograms.

7.1.6 SF.LCM Security and life cycle management

SF.LCM.1
  Management of phases and roles
  For the TOE the following life-cycle phases have been identified:
      1. Manufacturing phase
      2. Personalisation phase
      3. Operational phase
      4. Termination phase
  Each life-cycle phase (or state) has its typical user acting as role holder.

                           Polymorphic eMRTD document holder
Terminated phase           None

  All role holders in Manufacturing, Pre-Personalisation and Personalisation
  phases are identified by cryptographic authentication keys. In Operational
  phase the PACE password is required to authenticate the Basic or Extended
  Inspection System in order to get access to the non-sensitive ICAO LDS
  datagroups.
  The IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic
  eMRTD Configuration) Applet maintains the internal life-cycle state the
  moment that the applet is installed. This state, together with the access
  control mechanisms force the Terminal into a specific role, for the pre-
  personalisation and subsequent, personalisation and operational phases. The
  phases (and corresponding life-cycle states) are controlled by APDU
  commands.



SF.LCM.2
  Life Cycle states of the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
  (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet
  The TOE supports the following life-cycle states:
      1. Not instantiated (applet resides in ROM or in EEPROM)
      2. PRE-PERSONALISATION state
      3. PERSONALISATION state
      4. OPERATIONAL state
      5. TERMINATED state (irreversibly)
  Each life-cycle phase (or state) has its typical user acting as role holder.

     FIA_UID.1/PACE, Timing of identification. The TOE allows to carry out the
        PACE Protocol after successful user identification
     FIA_UAU.1/PACE, Timing of authentication. The TOE prevents reuse of
        authentication data related to the PACE protocol, i.e. according
        authentication mechanisms.
     FIA_UAU.4/PACE, Single-use authentication mechanisms - Single-use
        authentication of the Terminal by the TOE
     FIA_UAU.5/PACE, Multiple authentication mechanisms to support user
        authentication. The TOE provides multiple authentication mechanisms,
        PACE, symmetric key based authentication mechanism, etc.
     FIA_UAU.6/PACE, Re-authenticating of Terminal by the TOE. The TOE re-

Glossary

Term                Definition
Accurate Terminal A Terminal Certificate is accurate, if the issuing Document Verifier is
Certificate       trusted by the travel documentâs chip to produce Terminal
                  Certificates with the correct certificate effective date, see [TR-
                  03110-1].
Advanced            A specific order of authentication steps between a travel document
Inspection          and a terminal as required by [TR-03110-1], namely (i) PACE, (ii)
Procedure (with     Chip Authentication v.1, (iii) Passive Authentication with SOD and
PACE)               (iv) Terminal Authentication v.1. AIP can generally be used by EIS-
                    AIP-PACE.
Agreement           This term is used in the current ST in order to reflect an appropriate
                    relationship between the parties involved, but not as a legal notion.

Active              Security mechanism defined in [ICAO-9303]. Option by which means
Authentication      the MTRDâs chip proves and the inspection system verifies the
                    identity and authenticity of the MTRDâs chip as part of a genuine
                    MRTD issued by a known State of organization.

Application note    Optional informative part of the PP containing sensitive supporting
                    information that is considered relevant or useful for the construction,
                    evaluation, or use of the TOE (cf. CC part 1, section B.2.7).
Audit records       Write-only-once non-volatile memory area of the MRTDs chip to
                    store the Initialisation Data and Pre-personalization Data.

1.3 TOE Overview
The Security Target (ST) defines the security objectives and requirements for a
contact or contactless based chip of machine readable travel documents (MRTD)
based on the requirements and recommendations of the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO), EU requirements for biometric European passport
(Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 and Commission Implementing Decision
6181) and Biometric European Resident Permit (REGULATION (EU) 2017/1954
and Commission Implementing Decision 6178). This product is intended to
enable verification of the authenticity of the travel document and to identify its
holder during a border control, using an inspection system. The verification
process is based on Extended Access Control with Password Authenticated
Connection Establishment (PACE) and optionally Active Authentication (AA).

The main features and their origin are the following:
ï· Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
   according to ICAO Technical Report âSupplemental Access Controlâ [ICAO-
   9303] part 11 and strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0068-V2 [PACE-PP] for
   protection of the communication between terminal and chip. The following
   PACE mapping modes are supported and covered by the TOE:
      o    Generic Mapping (PACE-GM)
      o    Integrated Mapping (PACE-IM)
      o    Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM), which combines PACE-GM
           with Chip Authentication into a single protocol.

ï·   Chip Authentication v1
    according to BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1], [TR-03110-3] and
    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    travel documentâs chip to the inspection system.
ï·   Terminal Authentication v1
    according to BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1], [TR-03110-3] and
    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    inspection system to travel documentâs chip and protects the confidentiality
    and integrity of the sensitive biometric reference data during their
    transmission from the TOE to the inspection system.

As a feature that can be optionally configured the TOE supports:
ï·   Active Authentication
    which according to [ICAO-9303] prevents copying the SOD and proves that it
    has been read from the authentic chip. It proves that the chip has not been
    substituted.


ï·   Polymorphic Authentication
    which according to [PCA-eMRTD] provides additional privacy by randomisation
    of returned Polymorphic Identities, Polymorphic Pseudonyms and
    Complementary Polymorphic ID attributes in combination with standard ICAO
    and EAC1 eMRTD protocols specified in ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] and BSI
    TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1] and [TR 03110-3].

The TOE may also be used as an ISO driving license, compliant to ISO/IEC 18013
or ISO/IEC TR 19446 supporting PACE, AA and CA, as both applications (MRTD
and IDL) share the same protocols and data structure organization. Therefore, in
the rest of the document, the word âMRTDâ MAY be understood either as a MRTD
in the sense of ICAO, or a driving license compliant to ISO/IEC 18013 or ISO/IEC
TR 19446 depending on the targeted usage envisioned by the issuer.

Application note
This TOE claims an assurance level EAL5 augmented with AVA_VAN.5 and
ALC_DVS.2. AVA_VAN.5 implies that the TOE is resistant to attacks performed by
an attacker possessing "High attack potential".
Not all key sizes specified in this security target have sufficient cryptographic
strength for satisfying the AVA_VAN.5 âhigh attack potentialâ. In order to be
protected against attackers with a "high attack potential", sufficiently large
cryptographic key sizes SHALL be configured for this TOE. References can be
found in national and international document standards. Further details have
been specified in the TOEâs guidance documentation [AGD_PRE].

[TR-03110] have also been refered to in ISO18013 for EU driving licences. The
BAP-1 protocol defined in ISO18013 is equal to Basic Access Protocol (BAC)
defined in [ICAO-9303]. As to the logical data structure, the ISO18013 uses the
same concept of Passive Authentication defined in [ICAO-9303], but specifies
different ISO7816-4 elementary file identifiers for storing the ICAO defined
content of DG3, DG4 and DG15.

When an Issuing state is using the product as an ISO compliant Driving licence,
the following name mapping of roles, definitions, data groups and protocol is

use of TOE configured as respectively ICAO/EAC eMRTD/Driving licence and
Polymorphic eMRTD.


1.4.2.1 ICAO/EAC eMRTD and ISO Driving licence
This sub section explains the TOE security features for operational use of TOE
configured as ICAO/EAC eMRTD or as Driving Licence.

A State or Organisation issues travel documents to be used by the holder for
international travel. The traveller presents a travel document to the inspection
system to prove his or her identity. The travel document in context of this
Security Target contains:
  I.  visual (eye readable) biographical data and portrait of the holder,
 II.  a separate data summary (MRZ data) for visual and machine reading using
       OCR methods in the Machine readable zone (MRZ) and
III.  data elements on the travel documentâs chip according to LDS in case of
       contactless machine reading.

The authentication of the traveller is based on:
  I.  the possession of a valid travel document personalized for a holder with
      the claimed identity as given on the biographical data page and
 II.  biometrics using the reference data stored in the travel document.

                              eMRTD Configuration)


The issuing State or Organization ensures the authenticity of the data of genuine
travel documents. The receiving State trusts a genuine travel document of an
issuing State or Organization.

For this Security Target the travel document is viewed as unit of:
(i) the physical part of the travel document in form of paper and/or plastic
    and chip. It presents visual readable data including (but not limited to)
    personal data of the travel document holder
    (a) the biographical data on the biographical data page of the travel
         document surface,
    (b) the printed data in the Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) and
    (c) the printed portrait.

(ii) the logical travel document as data of the travel document holder stored
     according to the Logical Data Structure as defined in [ICAO-9303] as specified
     by ICAO on the contact based or contactless integrated circuit. It presents
     contact based / contactless readable data including(but not limited to)
     personal data of the travel document holder
     (a) the digital Machine Readable Zone Data (digital MRZ data, EF.DG1),
     (b) the digitized portraits (EF.DG2),
     (c) the biometric reference data of finger(s) (EF.DG3) or iris image(s)
          (EF.DG4) or both1,
     (d) the other data according to LDS (EF.DG5 to EF.DG16) and
     (e) the Document Security Object (SOD).


The issuing State or Organisation implements security features of the travel
document to maintain the authenticity and integrity of the travel document and
their data. The physical part of the travel document and the travel documentâs
chip are identified by the Document Number.

The physical part of the travel document is protected by physical security
measures (e.g. watermark, security printing), logical (e.g. authentication keys of
the travel documentâs chip) and organisational security measures (e.g. control of
materials, personalisation procedures) [ICAO-9303].These security measures can
include the binding of the travel documentâs chip to the travel document.

The logical travel document is protected in authenticity and integrity by a digital
signature created by the document signer acting for the issuing State or
Organisation and the security features of the travel documentâs chip.

The ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] defines the baseline security methods Passive
Authentication, advanced security access methods Basic Access Control (BAC)
and Password Authenticated Connection Establishment to the logical travel



These biometric reference data are optional according to [ICAO-9303]. This ST assumes that the issuing State or
1

Organisation uses this option and protects these data by means of extended access control.

document, Active Authentication of the travel documentâs chip, Extended Access
Control and the Data Encryption of sensitive biometrics as optional security
measure. The Passive Authentication Mechanism is performed completely and
independently of the TOE by the TOE environment.

The BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1] and [TR 03110-3] specify the
Extended Access Control protocols Chip Authentication version 1 (CAv1) and
Terminal Authentication (TAv1), which are required to get secured access to the
biometric data stored in data groups DG3 and DG4 in combination with PACE or
BAC.

This Security Target addresses the protection of the logical travel document:
   (i) in integrity by write-only-once access control and by physical means, and
   (ii) in confidentiality by the Extended Access Control Mechanism.

This Security Target addresses the Chip Authentication Version 1 described in
[TR-03110-1] and PACE-CAM described in [ICAO-9303] part 11 as an alternative
to the Active Authentication stated in [ICAO-9303].

For Basic Access Control (BAC) supported by the product, a separate evaluation
and certification is performed with ST [ST-BAC].

The confidentiality by Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
is a mandatory security feature of the TOE. The travel document shall strictly
conform to the âCommon Criteria Protection Profile Machine Readable Travel
Document using Standard Inspection Procedure with PACE [PACE-PP]. Note that
[PACE-PP] considers high attack potential.

For the PACE protocol according to [ICAO-9303] part 11, the following steps shall
be performed:
 (i) the travel document's chip encrypts a nonce with the shared password,
       derived from the MRZ resp. CAN data and transmits the encrypted nonce
       together with the domain parameters to the terminal.
 (ii) The terminal recovers the nonce using the shared password, by
       (physically) reading the MRZ or CAN data. This nonce shall be converted to
       a group generator using one of the following mapping algorithms, which
       maps a static generator to an ephemeral generator:
           a. Generic mapping (PACE-GM) or
           b. Integrated mapping PACE-IM)
 (iii) The travel document's chip and terminal computer perform a Diffie-
       Hellmann key agreement together with the ephemeral domain parameters
       to create a shared secret. Both parties derive the session keys KMAC and
       KENC from the shared secret.
 (iv) Each party generates an authentication token, sends it to the other party
       and verifies the received token.

In case of PACE with Chip Authenticated Mapping (PACE-CAM), in addition to the
steps above executed for the PACE-GM variant, the MRTD chip computes Chip
Authentication Data CAIC, encrypts them AIC = E(KSEnc, CAIC) and sends them

to the terminal. The terminal decrypts AIC and verifies the authenticity of the
chip using the recovered Chip Authentication Data CAIC.

After successful key negotiation, the terminal and the travel document's chip
provide private communication (secure messaging) [TR-03110-1], [ICAO-9303].

This Security Target requires the TOE to implement the Extended Access Control
as defined in [TR-03110-1]. The Extended Access Control consists of two parts:
  (i) the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1 and
  (ii) the Terminal Authentication Protocol Version 1 (v.1).

The Chip Authentication Protocol v.1
  (i) authenticates the travel documentâs chip to the inspection system and
  (ii) establishes secure messaging which is used by Terminal Authentication v.1
       to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the sensitive biometric
       reference data during their transmission from the TOE to the inspection
       system. Therefore Terminal Authentication v.1 can only be performed if
       Chip Authentication v.1has been successfully executed.

The Terminal Authentication Protocolv.1 consists of
  (i) the authentication of the inspection system as entity authorized by the
       receiving State or Organisation through the issuing State, and
  (ii) an access control by the TOE to allow reading the sensitive biometric
       reference data only to successfully authenticated authorized inspection
       systems.

The Active Authentication protocol may be optionally configured during
personalisation.

The issuing State or Organisation authorizes the receiving State by means of
certification the authentication public keys of Document Verifiers who create
Inspection System Certificates.


1.4.2.2 Polymorphic eMRTD

In addition to an ICAO/EAC eMRTD functionality, the TOE supports Polymorphic
eMRTD extensions that can be configured using the same applet during
personalisation. The TOEâs Polymorphic eMRTD extensions enable secure
authentication with enhanced privacy protection features. The Polymorphic
extensions provide the holder the possibility to authenticate towards a service
provider using an authentication service in a non-traceable and non-linkable
manner thanks to usage of Polymorphic ID attributes.

The Polymorphic extensions are used to configure a Polymorphic eMRTD as stand
alone application instance or next to an ICAO/EAC eMRTD/Driving application
licence instance having its own application identifier during personalisation.

                        eMRTD Configuration)

The Polymorphic eMRTD uses the same ICAO and EAC1 protocols like PACEv2,
Chip Authentication v1 (CAv1) and Terminal Authentication (v1) as defined in
[ICAO-9303], [TR-03110-1] and [TR-03110-3]. The TOEâs Polymorphic eMRTD
extensions provide the following features:

   ï·   Secure storage of the Polymorphic ID attributes during personalisation or
       the TOE.
   ï·   Polymorphic Authentication Protocol (PMA) for authenticated access with
       user consent, randomization and secure readout of the Polymorphic ID
       attributes, in combination with PACEv2 and EAC1 eMRTD protocols.
   ï·   PACEv2 protocol extended with PIN and PUK passwords, to enforce user
       authentication (document holder verification) in compliance with [TR-
       03101-3].

For Polymorphic eMRTD, the PACE protocol is configured with PIN, PUK and CAN
passwords in compliance with [TR-03110-3] during personalisation. Only PACE-
GM and PACE-IM are configurable for a Polymorphic eMRTD.

The Active Authentication protocol shall not be configured for a polymorphic
eMRTD.

The logical data structure consists only of EF.CVCA, DG14 and EF.SOD. In order
to assure a sufficient level of privacy during authentication the CAv1 private key
and EF.SOD are shared amoung a sufficient high number of personalised
Polymorphic eMRTDs, i.e. the logical data structure does not contain any unique
identifiable data.



1.4.3 TOE life cycle
The TOE life cycle is described in terms of its four life cycle phases. (With respect
to the [SIC-PP], the TOE life-cycle is additionally subdivided into 7 steps in the
ST. These steps are denoted too in the following although the sequence of the
steps differs for the TOE life cycle).

1.4.3.1 Phase 1 âDevelopmentâ
(Step1) The TOE is developed in phase 1. The IC developer develops the
integrated circuit, the IC Dedicated Software and the guidance documentation
associated with these TOE components.
The IC developer also acts as the developer of the embedded software (operating
system), which is the NXP JCOP 3 P60.

(Step2) The software developer uses the guidance documentation for the
integrated circuit and the guidance documentation for relevant parts of the NXP
JCOP 3 P60 and develops the ePassport application and the guidance
documentation associated with this TOE component.

The ePassport application (i.e. the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
(SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet run time code) may be
integrated either in ROM or in EEPROM of the chip. Depending on the intention:
      (a) the ePassport application is securely delivered directly from the
          software developer (IDEMIA development dept.) to the IC manufacturer
          (NXP). The applet code will be integrated into the ROM mask code or
          inEEPROM by the IC manufacturer, or
      (b) the ePassport application is securely delivered directly from the
          software developer (IDEMIA development dept.) to the travel document
          manufacturer (IDEMIA production dept.) .) for loading in EEPROM.

Notice that the guidance documentation of the ePassport application is always
securely delivered directly from the software developer (IDEMIA development
dept.) to the travel document manufacturer (IDEMIA production dept.).


1.4.3.2 Phase 2 âManufacturingâ
(Step3) In a first step the TOE integrated circuit is produced containing the travel
documentâs chip Dedicated Software, the parts of the travel documentâs chip
Embedded Software and in case of alternative a) the ePassport application in
ROM or in EEPROM.

The IC manufacturer writes the IC Identification Data onto the chip to control the
IC as travel document material during the IC manufacturing and the delivery
process to the travel document manufacturer. The IC is securely delivered from
the IC manufacturer to the travel document manufacturer.

                           eMRTD Configuration)

If necessary the IC manufacturer adds the parts of the IC Embedded Software in
the non-volatile programmable memories (for instance EEPROM).

(Step4 optional) The travel document manufacturer combines the IC with
hardware for the contact based / contactless interface in the travel document
unless the travel document consist of the chip only.

(Step5) The travel document manufacturer
  i.  adds the IC Embedded Software or part of it in the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM) if necessary and in case
      of alternative (b), loads the ePassport application into the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM),
 ii.      creates the ePassport application and
iii.      equips travel documentâs chips with pre-personalization Data.

EAC PP Application Note 1: Creation of the application for this TOE implies
Applet instantiation.

For this Security Target the following name mappings to the protection profile
[EAC-PP-V2] apply:
   ï· IC Dedicated SW = Low level IC libraries
   ï· travel documentâs chip Embedded Software = NXP JCOP 3 P60 operating
       system.
   ï· ePassport application = IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
       (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet run time code or an
       instantiation of it.
   ï· Pre-personalization Data = Personalization Agent Key Set, Card Production
       Life Cycle (CPLC) data and buffer settings.

Both the underlying platform and IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
(SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet provide configuration and
life-cycle management functions required for TOE preparation. TOE preparation
steps are performed in manufacturing phase and consist of the following 2
activities:
    1. Platform initialisation
       2. Pre-personalisation

Platform initialisation
Platform initialisation consists of the configuration of the NXP JCOP 3 P60 in
accordance with requirements specified in the platform administrator guidance
[PLTF-PRE] by using the dedicated platform commands. Furthermore the Pre-
Personalisation Agent key set is installed and (a part of) the CPLC data is
updated. To prevent unattended tracing of the MRTD document, the NXP JCOP 3
P60 is configured such that unauthenticated access to any platform unique
idenfiable data is not possible.

                              eMRTD Configuration)

Pre-personalisation
The pre-personalisation consists of the following steps:
   a. IC (chip) Authentication and getting chip access with the pre-
      personalisation key set.
   b. [optional] In case the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
      (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet runtime code does
      not reside in ROM, it is loaded into EEPROM.
   c. Install the applet application instances depending on the desired TOE
      configuration specified in section 1.4.2, using IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with
      Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet.
   d. Set the ePassport (and if present) the Polymorphic eMRTD applet
      irreversibly in its PERSONALISATION life-cycle state by installation of the
      Personalisation Agent specific personalisation key set(s).

During step (c) the CPLC data with the IC Identifier as well as the other pre-
personalisation data is configured in the TOE. The last step (d) finalizes the TOE.
This is the moment the TOE starts to exist and is ready for delivery to the
Personalisation Agent. The guidance documentation for the Personalisation Agent
is [AGD_PRE].

The pre-personalised travel document together with the IC Identifier is securely
delivered from the travel document manufacturer to the Personalisation Agent.
The travel document manufacturer also provides the relevant parts of the
guidance documentation [AGD_PRE] and [AGD_OPE] and the Personalisation
Agent Key set to the Personalisation Agent. The following table describes the
physical delivery of the TOE components:

1.4.3.3 Phase 3 âPersonalisation of the travel documentâ
(Step 6) The personalisation of the travel document includes
  i.  the survey of the MRTD holderâs biographical data,
 ii.   the enrolment of the MRTD holder biometric reference data (i.e. the
       digitized portraits and the optional biometric reference data),
iii.   the printing of the visual readable data onto the physical MRTD,
iv.    the writing of the TOE User Data and TSF Data into the logical MRTD and
 v.    configuration of the TSF if necessary.

The step (iv) is performed by the Personalisation Agent and includes but is not
limited to the creation of:
  i.   the digital MRZ data (EF.DG1),
 ii.   the digitized portrait (EF.DG2), and
iii.   the Document security object.

The signing of the Document security object by the Document signer [ICAO-
9303] finalizes the personalisation of the genuine travel document for the travel
document holder. The personalised travel document (together with appropriate
guidance (AGD_OPE) for TOE usage if necessary) is handed over to the travel
document holder for operational use.

The personalisation of Polymorphic eMRTD application instance includes:

 i.    establishing the identity of the polymorphic eMRTD document holder,
 ii.   Requesting the required Polymorphic eMRTD ID attributes from the central
       Key Management authority,
iii.   writing Polymorphic ID attributes, Polymorphic LDS data as defined in
       [PCA-eMRTD],
iv.    writing the TSF data (PIN, PUK, CAv1 private key) as defined in [PCA-
       eMRTD],
 v.    signing the Document Security Object defined in
       [ICAO-9303] (in the role of DS).


The signing of the Document security object by the Document signer [ICAO-
9303] finalizes the personalisation of the genuine Polymorphic eMRTD document
for the travel document holder. The personalised Polymorphic eMRTD document
(together with appropriate guidance (AGD_OPE) for TOE usage if necessary) is
handed over to the Polymorphic eMRTD document holder for operational use.

Authentication trust anchor, the effective date and the Chip Authentication
Private Key.

EAC PP Application note 3: This ST distinguishes between the Personalisation
Agent as entity known to the TOE and the Document Signer as entity in the TOE
IT environment signing the Document security object as described in [ICAO-
9303]. This approach allows but does not enforce the separation of these roles.


1.4.3.4 Phase 4 âOperational Useâ
(Step 7) The TOE is used as a travel document's chip by the traveller and the
inspection systems in the âOperational Useâ phase. The user data can be read
according to the security policy of the issuing State or Organisation and can be
used according to the security policy of the issuing State but they can never be
modified.

EAC PP Application note 42: The intention of the ST is to consider at least the
phases 1 and parts of phase 2 (i.e. Step1 to Step3) as part of the evaluation and
therefore to define the TOE delivery according to CC after this phase. Since
specific production steps of phase 2 are of minor security relevance (e.g. booklet
manufacturing and antenna integration) these are not part of the CC evaluation
under ALC. Nevertheless the decision about this has to be taken by the
certification body resp. the national body of the issuing State or Organisation. In
this case the national body of the issuing State or Organisation is responsible for
these specific production steps.
Note that the personalisation process and its environment may depend on
specific security needs of an issuing State or Organisation. All production,
generation and installation procedures after TOE delivery up to the âOperational
Useâ (phase 4) have to be considered in the product evaluation process under
AGD assurance class. Therefore, the Security Target outlines the split up of
P.Manufact, P.Personalisation and the related security objectives into aspects
relevant before vs. after TOE delivery.


1.4.3.5 Non-TOE hardware/software/firmware required by the TOE
There is no explicit non-TOE hardware, software or firmware required by the TOE
to perform its claimed security features. The TOE is defined to comprise the chip
and the complete operating system and application. Note, the inlay holding the
chip as well as the antenna and the booklet (holding the printed MRZ) are
needed to represent a complete travel document. Nevertheless, these parts are
not inevitable for the secure operation of the TOE.




2
 For this ST all steps of both phase 1 and phase 2 are part of the evaluation and therefore define the TOE
delivery according to the CC evaluation after this phase.

2.3 Package Claim
This ST is conforming to assurance package EAL5 augmented with ALC_DVS.2
and AVA_VAN.5 defined in CC part 3 [CC-3].


2.4 PP Conformance Rationale
This ST claims strict conformance to [EAC-PP-V2]. According to hints in [EAC-PP-
V2] parts of the [PACE-PP] have been included into this ST. A detailed
justification is given in the following.


2.4.1 Main aspects
-   The TOE description (chapter 1.3) is based on the TOE definition and TOE
    usage of [EAC-PP, 1.1]. It was enhanced by product specific details.

-   All definitions of the security problem definition in [EAC-PP, 3] have been
    taken exactly from the protection profile in the same wording.

-   All security objectives have been taken exactly from [EAC-PP, 4] in the same
    wording, except for OT.Chip_Auth_Proof which is enhanced to support
    Active Authentication.

-   The part of extended components definition has been taken originally from
    [EAC-PP, 5].

-   All SFRs for the TOE have been taken originally from the [EAC-PP, 6.1] added
    by according iterations, selections and assignments.

-   The security assurance requirements (SARs) have been taken originally from
    the EAC-PP. The requirements are shifted to those of EAL 5+.


2.4.2 Overview of differences between the PP and the ST

The Active Authentication has been added to the TOE. For that:
- One assumption has been added to cover Active Authentication during
   personalization: A.Pers_Agent_AA
- Two security objectives for the environment have been added:
   OE.Auth_Key_MRTD and OE.AA_MRTD. These additions to the original
   objectives of the PP do not contradict with any other objective nor mitigate a
   threat (or part of a threat) meant to be addressed by security objectives for
   the TOE in the PP.
- Three security functional requirements have been added:
             ï· FCS_COP.1/SIG_GEN
             ï·   FIA_API.1/AA
             ï·   FMT_MTD.1/AAPK

                  IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy
                                                                2018_2000036361

                        eMRTD Configuration)

The additional functionality of Password Authenticated Connection Establishment
with Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM) has been added to the TOE. It
possesses the same security requirements as the PACE functionality, which
means that the same security problem definition is applicable for PACE-CAM.


The following additional SFRs have been defined for PACE-CAM:
             ï· FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM
             ï·   FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM
             ï·   FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM
             ï·   FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM
             ï·   FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM
             ï·   FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ
             ï·   FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_WRITE




The additional functionality of the Polymorphic eMRTD extensions has been
added to the TOE with: (i) additional security problem definition; (ii) additional
security objectives; (iii) additional SFRs. Notice that many SFRs are included
from the [EACv2-PP].
                        Security Target Lite
                           eneral support for cryptographic operations needed.

OT.Data_Authenticity The security objective OT.Data_Authenticity aims
  ensuring authenticity of the User- and TSF data (after the PACE
  Authentication) by enabling its verification at the terminal-side and by an
  active verification by the TOE itself. This objective is mainly achieved by
  FTP_ITC.1/PACE using FCS_COP.1/PACE_MAC. A prerequisite for establishing
  this trusted channel is a successful PACE or Chip and Terminal Authentication
  v.1       FIA_UID.1/PACE,       FIA_UAU.1/PACE        (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM,
  FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) using FCS_CKM.1/DH_PACE resp.
  FCS_CKM.1/CA and possessing the special properties FIA_UAU.5/PACE,
  FIA_UAU.6/PACE (FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM, FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM for PACE
  CAM) resp. FIA_UAU.6/EAC. FDP_RIP.1 requires erasing the values of session
  keys (here: for KMAC). FIA_UAU.4/PACE, FIA_UAU.5/PACE and FCS_CKM.4
  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM, FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM and FCS_CKM.4 for PACE
  CAM) represent some required specific properties of the protocols used. The
  SFR FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords, the
  Chip Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication Private Key. The
  SFR FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE
  passwords and the modular invert of the CA key. FMT_MTD.1/PA requires that
  SOD containing signature over the User Data stored on the TOE and used for
  the Passive Authentication is allowed to be written by the Personalisation
  Agent only and, hence, is to be considered as trustworthy. The SFR
  FCS_RND.1 represents a general support for cryptographic operations needed.
  The SFRs FMT_SMF.1 and FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles
  related.

OT.Data_Confidentiality The security objective OT.Data_Confidentiality aims
  that the TOE always ensures confidentiality of the User- and TSF-data stored
  and, after the PACE Authentication resp. Chip Authentication, of these data
  exchanged. This objective for the data stored is mainly achieved by
                        Security Target Lite
                                                                   Ref.:

                       eMRTD Configuration)

  (FDP_ACC.1/TRM, FDP_ACF.1/TRM). FIA_UAU.4/PACE, FIA_UAU.5/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM,        FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM      for   PACE    CAM)    and
  FCS_CKM.4 represent some required specific properties of the protocols used.
  This objective for the data exchanged is mainly achieved by FDP_UCT.1/TRM,
  FDP_UIT.1/TRM and FTP_ITC.1/PACE using FCS_COP.1/PACE_ENC resp.
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC. A prerequisite for establishing this trusted channel is a
  successful PACE or Chip and Terminal Authentication v.1 FIA_UID.1/PACE,
  FIA_UAU.1/PACE (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM, FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE
  CAM) using FCS_CKM.1/DH_PACE resp. FCS_CKM.1/CA and possessing the
  special properties FIA_UAU.5/PACE, FIA_UAU.6/PACE (FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM,
  FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) resp. FIA_UAU.6/EAC. FDP_RIP.1
  requires erasing the values of session keys (here: for Kenc). The SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords, the Chip
  Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication Private Key. The SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords
  and the modular invert of the CA key. FMT_MTD.1/PA requires that SOD
  containing signature over the User Data stored on the TOE and used for the
  Passive Authentication is allowed to be written by the Personalisation Agent
  only and, hence, is to be considered trustworthy. The SFR FCS_RND.1
  represents the general support for cryptographic operations needed. The SFRs
  FMT_SMF.1 and FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related.

OT.Tracing The security objective OT.Tracing aims that the TOE prevents
  gathering TOE tracing data by means of unambiguous identifying the travel
  document remotely through establishing or listening to a communication via
  the contactless/contact-based interface of the TOE without a priori knowledge
  of the correct values of shared passwords (CAN, MRZ, PIN, PUK). This
  objective is achieved as follows:
            1. While establishing PACE communication with CAN, MRZ or PUK
                (non-blocking      authentication /   authorization  data)   by
                FIA_AFL.1/PACE,
            2. while establishing PACE communication using the PIN (blocking
                authentication data) by FIA_AFL.1/Block_PIN,
            3. for listening to PACE communication and for establishing CAv1
                communication by FTP_ITC.1/PACE,
            4. and      for     listening     to  CAv1     communication     by
                FTP_ITC.1/Polymorphic. The trusted channel shall be established
                by performing the PACE, CAv1 and TAv1 protocols according to
                [TR03110TR-03110] and the Polymorphic Authentication protocol
                (PMA).

OT.Prot_Abuse-Func The security objective OT.Prot_Abuse-Func âProtection
  against Abuse of Functionalityâ is ensured by the SFRs FMT_LIM.1, FMT_LIM.2,
  FMT_LIM.1/POLY and FMT_LIM.2/POLY which prevent misuse of test
  functionality of the TOE or other features which may not be used after TOE
  Delivery.

OT.Prot_Inf_Leak The security objective OT.Prot_Inf_Leak âProtection against
  Information Leakageâ requires the TOE to protect confidential TSF data stored
  and/or processed in the travel documentâs chip against disclosure
      by measurement and analysis of the shape and amplitude of signals or the
        time between events found by measuring signals on the electromagnetic
        field, power consumption, clock, or I/O lines which is addressed by the
        SFR FPT_EMS.1,
      by forcing a malfunction of the TOE which is addressed by the SFR
        FPT_FLS.1 and FPT_TST.1, and/or
      by a physical manipulation of the TOE which is addressed by the SFR
        FPT_PHP.3.

OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper The security objective OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper âProtection
  against Physical Tamperingâ is covered by the SFR FPT_PHP.3.

OT.Prot_Malfunction The security objective OT.Prot_Malfunction âProtection
  against Malfunctionsâ is covered by (i) the SFR FPT_TST.1 which requires self-
  tests to demonstrate the correct operation and tests of authorized users to
  verify the integrity of TSF data and TSF code, and (ii) the SFRFPT_FLS.1 which
  requires a secure state in case of detected failure or operating conditions
  possibly causing a malfunction.

OT.Identification The security objective OT.Identification âIdentification of the
  TOEâ addresses the storage of Initialisation and Pre-Personalisation Data in its
  non-volatile memory, whereby they also include the IC Identification Data
  uniquely identifying the TOEâs chip. This will be ensured by TSF according to
  SFR FAU_SAS.1. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA allows only the Manufacturer
  to write Initialisation and Pre-personalisation Data (including the
  Personalisation Agent key set). The SFR FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS requires the
  Personalisation Agent to disable access to Initialisation and Pre-personalisation
  Data in the life cycle phase âoperational useâ. The SFRs FMT_SMF.1 and
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related.

OT.AC_Pers The       security   objective  OT.AC_Pers      âAccess   Control   for
  Personalisation of logical travel documentâ addresses the access control of the
  writing the logical travel document. The justification for the SFRs FAU_SAS.1,
  FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA and FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS arises from the justification for
  OT.Identification above with respect to the Pre-personalisation Data. The write
  access to the logical travel document data are defined by the SFR
  FIA_UID.1/PACE (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM), FIA_UAU.1/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM), FDP_ACC.1/TRM and FDP_ACF.1/TRM
  in the same way: only the successfully authenticated Personalisation Agent is
  allowed to write the data of the groups EF.DG1 to EF.DG16 of the logical travel
  document only once. FMT_MTD.1/PA covers the related property of
  OT.AC_Pers (writing SOD and, in generally, personalization data). The SFR
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE lists the roles (including Personalisation Agent) and the SFR
  FMT_SMF.1 lists the TSF management functions (including Personalisation).

  The SFRs FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ (FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ for
  PACE CAM protocol) and FPT_EMS.1 restrict the access to the Personalisation
  Agent Keys, the Chip Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication
  Private key. The authentication of the terminal as Personalisation Agent shall
  be performed by TSF according to SFRs FIA_UAU.4/PACE and FIA_UAU.5/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM and FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). If the
  Personalisation Terminal wants to authenticate itself to the TOE by means of
  the Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 (after Chip Authentication v.1) with
  the Personalisation Agent Keys, the TOE will use TSF according to the
  FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the challenge), FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the
  derivation of the new session keys after Chip Authentication v.1), and
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC (for the ENC_MAC_Mode secure
  messaging), FCS_COP.1/SIG_VER (as part of the Terminal Authentication
  Protocol v.1) and FIA_UAU.6/EAC (for the re-authentication). If the
  Personalisation Terminal wants to authenticate itself to the TOE by means of
  the Authentication Mechanism with the Personalisation Agent Key, the TOE will
  use TSF according to the FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the challenge) and
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC (to verify the authentication attempt). The session keys
  are destroyed according to FCS_CKM.4 after use.

OT.Sens_Data_Conf The            security     objective      OT.Sense_Data_Confâ
  Confidentiality of sensitive biometric reference dataâ is enforced by the Access
  Control SFP defined in FDP_ACC.1/TRM and FDP_ACF.1/TRM allowing the data
  of EF.DG3 and EF.DG4 only to be read by successfully authenticated Extended
  Inspection System being authorized by a valid certificate according
  FCS_COP.1/SIG_VER. The SFRs FIA_UID.1/PACE and FIA_UAU.1/PACE
  (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM and FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) require the
  identification and authentication of the inspection systems. The SFR
  FIA_UAU.5/PACE requires the successful Chip Authentication (CA) v.1 before
  any     authentication    attempt   as    Extended     Inspection  System    (or
  FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). During the protected communication
  following the CA v.1 the reuse of authentication data is prevented by
  FIA_UAU.4/PACE (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). The SFR
  FIA_UAU.6/EAC and FDP_UCT.1/TRM requires the confidentiality protection of
  the transmitted data after Chip Authentication v.1 by means of secure
  messaging implemented by the cryptographic functions according to
  FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the terminal authentication challenge),
  FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the generation of shared secret and for the derivation of
  the new session keys), and FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC for
  the ENC_MAC_Mode secure messaging. The session keys are destroyed
  according to FCS_CKM.4 after use. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/CAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ requires that the Chip Authentication Key cannot be
  written unauthorized or read afterwards. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/AAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ requires that the Active Authentication Key cannot be
  written       unauthorized       or      read      afterwards.      The     SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_WRITE and FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ
  requires that the modular invert of the CA key cannot be written unauthorized
  or read afterwards. To allow a verification of the certificate chain as in

OT.Chip_Auth_Proof The security objective OT.Chip_Auth_Proof âProof of
  travel documentâs chip authenticityâ is ensured by the Chip Authentication
  Protocolv.1 provided by FIA_API.1/CA and by Active Authentication provided
  by FIA_API.1/AA proving the identity of the TOE. The Chip Authentication
  Protocolv.1 defined by FCS_CKM.1/CA is performed using a TOE internally
  stored confidential private key as required by FMT_MTD.1/CAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ. The Chip Authentication Protocolv.1 [TR-03110-1]
  requires additional TSF according to FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the derivation of the
  session keys), FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC (for the
  ENC_MAC_Mode        secure    messaging).    The   SFRs     FMT_SMF.1     and
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related. The Active
  Authentication defined by FCS_COP.1/SIG_GEN for the generation of the RSA
  Signature is performed using a TOE internally stored confidential private key
  as required by FMT_MTD.1/AAPK and FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ. According to
  FDP_ACF.1, only the successfully authenticated Inspection Systems are
  allowed to request active authentication (FDP_ACF.1.2, rule 2).

6.3.3.1.1 Rationale for the exclusion of Dependencies


The dependency FMT_MSA.3 of FDP_ACF.1/TRM is discarded. The access
  control TSF according to FDP_ACF.1/TRM uses security attributes which are
  defined during the personalisation and are fixed over the whole life time of the
  TOE. No management of these security attribute (i.e. SFR FMT_MSA.1 and
  FMT_MSA.3) is necessary here.

6.3.4 Rationale for the Security Assurance Requirements
The EAL5 was chosen to permits a developer to gain maximum assurance from
positive security engineering based upon rigorous commercial development
practices supported by moderate application of specialist security engineering
techniques. Such a TOE will probably be designed and developed with the intent
of achieving EAL5 assurance. It is likely that the additional costs attributable to
the EAL5 requirements, relative to rigorous development without the application
of specialised techniques, will not be large.

7.1.2 SF.CF Cryptographic functions support
Cryptographic function support is provided by the underlying NXP JCOP 3 P60,
i.e. the TOE relies on the underlying platform for performing its required
cryptographic operations.

SF.CF Cryptographic functions include:
     ï·   SF.CF.1: 3DES and AES cipher operations for secure messaging
     ï·   SF.CF.2: Digest calculations (SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and
         SHA-512)
     ï·   SF.CF.3: Signature generation (ECDSA, RSA)
     ï·   SF.CF.4: Signature verification (ECDSA, RSA)
     ï·   SF.CF.5: Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement (ECDH and DH)
     ï·   SF.CF.6: Key Generation (PACE ECDH/DH ephemeral keys and secure
         messaging MAC and ENC session keys)
     ï·   SF.CF.7: Key and secret authentication data Destruction
     ï·   SF.CF.8: True Random Number generation
     ï·   SF.CF.9: Randomization of PI/PP/CPI data as part of the Polymorphic
         Authentication protocol (PMA)




7.1.3 SF.ILTB Protection against interference, logical tampering
and bypass

SF.ILTB.1
  Protection against interference, logical tampering and bypass
  Security domains are supported by the Java Card platform used by the TOE
  underlying NXP JCOP 3 P60. The NXP JCOP 3 P60 provides protection against
  physical attack and performs self-tests as described in [PLTF-ST].
  The platform protects the TOE against malfunctions that are caused by
  exposure to operating conditions that may cause a malfunction. This includes
  hardware resets and operation outside the specified norms.
  The IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic
  eMRTD Configuration) Applet uses transient memory where a hardware reset
  always reverts the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
  (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet into an unauthenticated
  state.

7.1.4 SF.AC Access control / Storage and protection of logical
travel document data

SF.AC.1
  Access control / Storage and protection of logical travel document
  data
  The TOE provided access control, storage and protection of logical travel
  document data including access control to MRTD data. The TOE implements
  the subjects, objects, security attributes and rules according to the security
  attribute based access control. Access control is enforced by the APDU
  methods as specified in the interface defined in the functional specification.

7.1.5 SF.SM Secure Messaging

SF.SM.1
  Secure Messaging
  Secure messaging MAC and ENC operations are performed by the TOEâs
  platform.
  Secure messaging in ENC_MAC mode is established during PACE or re-
  established during Chip Authentication v1 and is based on SF.CF.1, 5, 6 and 8.

SF.SM.2
  Secure Messaging â Re-authentication
  The Retail MAC for 3DES and CMAC for AES are part of every APDU
  command/response when secure messaging is active after a successful PACE
  or Chip Authentication has been accomplished. Re-authentication after reset of
  the SM protocol is assured by accepting only valid (mandatory) MAC or CMAC
  cryptograms.

7.1.6 SF.LCM Security and life cycle management

SF.LCM.1
  Management of phases and roles
  For the TOE the following life-cycle phases have been identified:
      1. Manufacturing phase
      2. Personalisation phase
      3. Operational phase
      4. Termination phase
  Each life-cycle phase (or state) has its typical user acting as role holder.

                           Polymorphic eMRTD document holder
Terminated phase           None

  All role holders in Manufacturing, Pre-Personalisation and Personalisation
  phases are identified by cryptographic authentication keys. In Operational
  phase the PACE password is required to authenticate the Basic or Extended
  Inspection System in order to get access to the non-sensitive ICAO LDS
  datagroups.
  The IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic
  eMRTD Configuration) Applet maintains the internal life-cycle state the
  moment that the applet is installed. This state, together with the access
  control mechanisms force the Terminal into a specific role, for the pre-
  personalisation and subsequent, personalisation and operational phases. The
  phases (and corresponding life-cycle states) are controlled by APDU
  commands.



SF.LCM.2
  Life Cycle states of the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
  (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet
  The TOE supports the following life-cycle states:
      1. Not instantiated (applet resides in ROM or in EEPROM)
      2. PRE-PERSONALISATION state
      3. PERSONALISATION state
      4. OPERATIONAL state
      5. TERMINATED state (irreversibly)
  Each life-cycle phase (or state) has its typical user acting as role holder.

  It assumed that:
      o All authentication infrastructure keys used by the central Key
          Management       Authority     for   the    polymorphic    authentication
          infrastructure (generation and transformation of PP, PI and CPI) are
          generated, handled and stored securely.
      o The PP/PI/CPI are generated securely by the central Key Management
          Authority of the polymorphic authentication infrastructure and stored
          securely in the eMRTD polymorphic chip during the personalization
          phase.
      o The TOE communicates only with Trustworthy Authentication
          Service/Terminal during the Polymorphic Authentication.
      o The randomised PP, PI and CPI are securely received by Polymorphic
          Authentication Service/Terminal. The randomised PP, PI and CPI are
          transformed (âre-keyedâ) by the central Key Management Authority
          (i.e. ElGamal re-encryption of the randomized PP, PI and/or CPI using
          the public key of Servicez Provider, who has is authorized to read the
          plain value of identifying user attributes included in the PP, PI or CPI).
          Identification by the identifying user attributes contained inside the PP,
          PI and CPI takes place at the Service Provider.
  Application Note:
  This Assumption has been added to this ST for the polymorphic authentication
  infrastructure. This addition does not conflict with the strict conformance to
  PACE PP [PACE-PP] and EACv1 PP [EAC-PP-V2].

      o The issuing State or Organisation establishs the necessary public key
         infrastructure in order to limit the access to Polymorphic data of
         Polymorphic eMRTD document holders to authorized Organisations. The
         Country Verifying Certification Authority of the issuing State or
         Organisation generates card verifiable Document Verifier Certificates
         for the authorized Document Verifier only.
      o The issuing State or Organisation establishs the necessary public key
         infrastructure in order to (i) generate the Polymorphic eMRTD
         document's Chip Authentication Key Pair, (ii) sign and store the Chip
         Authentication Public Key in the Chip Authentication Public Key data
         and (iii) support Polymorphic Authentication Terminals/Services to
         verify the authenticity of the Polymorphic eMRTD document's chip
         according to [TR-03110] used for genuine Polymorphic eMRTD
         document by certification of the Chip Authentication Public Key by
         means of the Document Security Object.
      o The Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer establishes a public key
         infrastructure for the card verifiable certificates used for Terminal
         Authentication. For this aim, the Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer
         shall run a Country Verifying Certification Authority. The PKI shall fulfill
         the requirements and rules of the corresponding certificate policy. The
         Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer shall make the CVCA certificate
         available to the personalization agent or the manufacturer.
      o The polymorphic eMRTD document Issuer issues the polymorphic
         eMRTD document and approves it using the terminals and
         authentication services complying with all applicable laws and
         regulations.
  Application Note:
  This Assumption is an extension of the Assumption 'A.Auth_PKI' defined in
  [EAC-PP-V2]. For the EAC functionality of the TOE the assumption is necessary
  because it covers the pre-requisite for performing the Terminal Authentication
  Protocol Version 1.

A.Insp_Sys_Polymorphic

Polymorphic Inspection Systems and authentication services
     o Polymorphic    Inspection     Systems   (Polymorphic     Authentication
       Terminals/Services) ensure the confidentiality, Privacy, Authenticity
       and integrity of the polymorphic data read from the polymorphic
       eMRTD document (e.g. PACE PIN/PUK, integrity of PKI certificates,
       randomized PI, PP and optional CPI data, etc.), where it is necessary
       for a secure operation of the TOE.
     o Polymorphic Inspection Systems will prevent eavesdropping to their
       communication with the TOE before secure messaging is successfully
       established based on the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1.

   o   Polymorphic Inspection Systems examine the polymorphic eMRTD
       document presented by the polymorphic eMRTD document holder to
       verify its authenticity by means of the physical security measures and
       to detect any manipulation of the physical part of the polymorphic
       eMRTD document.
    o Polymorphic Inspection Systems include the Country Signing CA Public
       Key and implement the respective terminal part of the protocols
       required to execute PACE with PIN, Passive Authentication (PA), CAv1,
       TAv1 authentication according to [TR-03110-2] and Polymorphic
       Authentication (PMA). They are assumed to securely store static IS
       private keys and generate secure temporary session keys and nonces.
    o The Document Verifier authorizes Polymorphic Inspection Systems by
       creation of Inspection System Certificates for access to polymorphic
       user data stored the polymorphic eMRTD document. An Polymorphic
       Inspection Systems authenticates itselve to the polymorphic eMRTD
       document's chip for getting access to the polymorphic data with its
       private Terminal Authentication key and corresponding Inspection
       System Certificate.

4 Security Objectives

This chapter describes the security objectives for the TOE and the security
objectives for the TOE environment. The security objectives for the TOE
environment are separated into security objectives for the development and
production environment and security objectives for the operational environment.


4.1 Security Objectives for the TOE
This section describes the security objectives for the TOE addressing the aspects
of identified threats to be countered by the TOE and organizational security
policies to be met by the TOE.

4.1.1 Security Objectives listed in PP PACE

OT.Data_Integrity
  Integrity of Data
  The TOE must ensure integrity of the User Data and the TSF-data stored on it
  by protecting these data against unauthorised modification (physical
  manipulation and unauthorised modifying). The TOE must ensure integrity of
  the User Data and the TSF-data during their exchange between the TOE and
  the terminal connected (and represented by PACE authenticated BIS-PACE)
  after the PACE Authentication.

OT.Data_Authenticity
  Authenticity of Data
  The TOE must ensure authenticity of the User Data and the TSF-data stored
  on it by enabling verification of their authenticity at the terminal-side. The TOE
  must ensure authenticity of the User Data and the TSF-data during their
  exchange between the TOE and the terminal connected (and represented by
  PACE authenticated BIS-PACE)after the PACE Authentication. It shall happen
  by enabling such a verification at the terminal-side (at receiving by the
  terminal) and by an active verification by the TOE itself (at receiving by the
  TOE).

OT.Data_Confidentiality
  Confidentiality of Data
  The TOE must ensure confidentiality of the User Data and the TSF-data by
  granting read access only to the PACE authenticated BIS-PACE connected. The
  TOE must ensure confidentiality of the User Data and the TSF-data during
  their exchange between the TOE and the terminal connected (and represented
  by PACE authenticated BIS-PACE) after the PACE Authentication.

                       eMRTD Configuration)

OT.Tracing
  Tracing travel document
  The TOE must prevent gathering TOE tracing data by means of unambiguous
  identifying the travel document remotely through establishing or listening to a
  communication via the contactless/contact interface of the TOE without
  knowledge of the correct values of shared passwords (PACE passwords) in
  advance.

OT.Prot_Abuse-Func
  Protection against Abuse of Functionality
  The TOE must prevent that functions of the TOE, which may not be used in
  TOE operational phase, can be abused in order (i) to manipulate or to disclose
  the User Data stored in the TOE, (ii) to manipulate or to disclose the TSF-data
  stored in the TOE, (iii) to manipulate (bypass, deactivate or modify) soft-
  coded security functionality of the TOE.

OT.Prot_Inf_Leak
  Potection against Information Leakage The TOE must provide protection
  against disclosure of confidential User Data or/and TSF-data stored and/or
  processed by the travel document
      by measurement and analysis of the shape and amplitude of signals or the
        time between events found by measuring signals on the electromagnetic
        field, power consumption, clock, or I/O lines,
      by forcing a malfunction of the TOE and/or
      by a physical manipulation of the TOE.

OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper
  Protection against Physical Tampering
  The TOE must provide protection the confidentiality and integrity of the User
  Data, the TSF Data, and the MRTDâs chip Embedded Software. This includes
  protection against attacks with high attack potential by means of
      measuring through galvanic contacts which is direct physical probing on
        the chips surface except on pads being bonded (using standard tools for
        measuring voltage and current) or
      measuring not using galvanic contacts but other types of physical
        interaction between charges (using tools used in solid-state physics
        research and IC failure analysis)
      manipulation of the hardware and its security features, as well as
      controlled manipulation of memory contents (User Data, TSF Data) with a
        prior
      reverse-engineering to understand the design and its properties and
        functions.

                        eMRTD Configuration)

OT.Prot_Malfunction
  Protection against Malfunctions
  The TOE must ensure its correct operation. The TOE must prevent its
  operation outside the normal operating conditions where reliability and secure
  operation have not been proven or tested. This is to prevent functional errors
  in the TOE. The environmental conditions may include external energy
  (especially electromagnetic) fields, voltage (on any contacts), clock frequency
  or temperature.

OT.Identification
  Identification and Authentication of the TOE
  The TOE must provide means to store Initialisation and Pre-Personalisation
  Data in its non-volatile memory. The Initialisation Data must provide a unique
  identification of the IC during the manufacturing and the card issuing life cycle
  phases of the travel document. The storage of the Pre-Personalisation data
  includes writing of the Personalisation Agent Key(s).

OT.AC_Pers
  Access Control for Personalisation of logical MRTD
  The TOE must ensure that the logical travel document data in EF.DG1 to
  EF.DG16, the Document Security Object according to LDS [ICAO-9303] and
  the TSF data can be written by authorized Personalisation Agents only. The
  logical travel document data in EF.DG1 to EF.DG16 and the TSF data may be
  written only during and cannot be changed after personalisation of the
  document.

4.1.2 Additional Security Objectives from PP EAC

OT.Sens_Data_Conf
  Confidentiality of sensitive biometric reference data
  The TOE must ensure the confidentiality of the sensitive biometric reference
  data (EF.DG3 and EF.DG4) by granting read access only to authorized
  Extended Inspection Systems. The authorization of the inspection system is
  drawn from the Inspection System Certificate used for the successful
  authentication and shall be a non-strict subset of the authorization defined in
  the Document Verifier Certificate in the certificate chain to the Country Verifier
  Certification Authority of the issuing State or Organisation. The TOE must
  ensure the confidentiality of the logical travel document data during their
  transmission to the Extended Inspection System. The confidentiality of the
  sensitive biometric reference data shall be protected against attacks with high
  attack potential.

                    between, and Country Verifying Certification Authority Certificates
                    are on the highest level. A certificate of a lower level is signed with
                    the private key corresponding to the public key in the certificate of
                    the next higher level.
Counterfeit         An unauthorized copy or reproduction of a genuine security
                    document made by whatever means.
Country Signing     Self-signed certificate of the Country Signing CA Public Key
CA Certificate      (KPu CSCA) issued by CSCA stored in the inspection system.
(CCSCA)
Country Signing     An organisation enforcing the policy of the travel document Issuer
Certification       with respect to confirming correctness of user and TSF data stored in
Authority (CSCA)    the travel document. The CSCA represents the country specific root
                    of the PKI for the travel documents and creates the Document
                    Signer Certificates within this PKI.

                    The CSCA also issues the self-signed CSCA Certificate (CCSCA)
                    having to be distributed by strictly secure diplomatic means, see.
                    [ICAO-9303], 5.5.1.

                    The Country Signing Certification Authority issuing certificates for
                    Document Signers (cf. [6]) and the domestic CVCA may be
                    integrated into a single entity, e.g. a Country Certification Authority.
                    However, even in this case, separate key pairs must be used for
                    different roles, see [TR-03110-1].
Country Verifying   An organisation enforcing the privacy policy of the travel document
Certification       Issuer with respect to protection of user data stored in the travel
Authority (CVCA)    document (at a trial of a terminal to get an access to these data).
                    The CVCA represents the country specific root of the PKI for the
                    terminals using it and creates the Document Verifier Certificates
                    within this PKI. Updates of the public key of the CVCA are distributed
                    in form of CVCA Link-Certificates, see [TR-03110-1].

                    Since the Standard Inspection Procedure does not imply any
                    certificate-based terminal authentication, the current TOE cannot
                    recognise a CVCS as a subject; hence, it merely represents an
                    organizational entity within this ST.

                    The Country Signing Certification Authority (CSCA) issuing
                    certificates for Document Signers (cf. [ICAO-9303]) and the
                    domestic CVCA may be integrated into a single entity, e.g. a Country
                    Certification Authority. However, even in this case, separate key
                    pairs must be used for different roles, see [TR-03110-1].

Document Details   Data printed on and electronically stored in the travel document
Data               representing the document details like document type, issuing state,
                   document number, date of issue, date of expiry, issuing authority.
                   The document details data are less-sensitive data.

Document Basic     Pair of symmetric Triple-DES keys used for secure messaging with
Access Keys        encryption (key KENC) and message authentication (key KMAC) of
                   data transmitted between the MRTDâs chip and the inspection
                   system [ICAO-9303]. It is drawn from the printed MRZ of the
                   passport book to authenticate an entity able to read the printed MRZ
                   of the passport book.
Document           A RFC3369 CMS Signed Data Structure, signed by the Document
Security Object    Signer (DS). Carries the hash values of the LDS Data Groups. It is
(SOD)              stored in the MRTDâs chip. It may carry the Document Signer
                   Certificate (CDS). [ICAO-9303]
Document Signer    An organisation enforcing the policy of the CSCA and signing the
(DS)               Document Security Object stored on the travel document for passive
                   authentication.

                   A Document Signer is authorised by the national CSCA issuing the
                   Document Signer Certificate (CDS), see [TR-03110-1] and [ICAO-
                   9303].

                   This role is usually delegated to a Personalisation Agent.
Document Verifier An organisation enforcing the policies of the CVCA and of a Service
(DV)              Provider (here: of a governmental organisation / inspection
                  authority) and managing terminals belonging together (e.g.
                  terminals operated by a Stateâs border police), by â inter alia â
                  issuing Terminal Certificates. A Document Verifier is therefore a
                  Certification Authority, authorised by at least the national CVCA to
                  issue certificates for national terminals, see [TR-03110-1].
