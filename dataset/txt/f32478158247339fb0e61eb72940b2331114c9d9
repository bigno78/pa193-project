  control mechanisms force the Terminal into a specific role, for the pre-
  personalisation and subsequent, personalisation and operational phases. The
  phases (and corresponding life-cycle states) are controlled by APDU
  commands.

  Life Cycle states of the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
  (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet
  The TOE supports the following life-cycle states:
      1. Not instantiated (applet resides in ROM or in EEPROM)
      2. PRE-PERSONALISATION state
      3. PERSONALISATION state
      4. OPERATIONAL state
      5. TERMINATED state (irreversibly)
  Each life-cycle phase (or state) has its typical user acting as role holder.

  Management of TSF-Data
  The TOE allows only in its PERSONALISATION life-cycle state TSF data to be
  written onto the TOE.
  In OPERATIONAL life-cycle state the management of TSF-Data can only be
  performed:
    After successful Terminal Authentication. Updating the Country Verifier
      Certification Authority Public Key and Certificate is restricted to the
      Country Verifier Certification Authority. Modifying the Current Date is
      restricted to the Country Verifier Certification Authority, the Document
      Verifier and the domestic Extended Inspection System.
    After verification of the user PIN or PUK by issuing a dedicated PIN change
      command (RRC).



SF.LCM.4
  Protection of test features
  The IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic
  eMRTD Configuration) Applet does not have any dedicated test features
  implemented.
  The test features of the NXP JCOP 3 P60 are protected by ways described in
  [PLTF-ST] and guidance documentation.

  In all TOE life-cycle states the Personalization Agent Key set (MAC, ENC, KEK),
  the PACE passwords (derived from MRZ, CAN, PIN or PUK), the Chip
  Authentication Private Key, the Active Authentication Private Key are protected
  from disclosure. The IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
  (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet only stores keys in Java
  Card specified Key structures, which are protected by NXP JCOP 3 P60.

7.2.1.1 TOE Summary Specification

7.2.1.1.1 SF.IA Identification and Authentication


SF.IA.1 The implementation of PACE contributes to:
     FIA_AFL.1/PACE, Authentication failure handling PACE authentication using
        non-blocking authorisation data. The TOE increases the reaction time of
        the TOE after an unsuccessful authentication attempt with a wrong
        PACE passwords.
     FIA_UID.1/PACE, Timing of identification. The TOE allows to carry out the
        PACE Protocol after successful user identification
     FIA_UAU.1/PACE, Timing of authentication. The TOE prevents reuse of
        authentication data related to the PACE protocol, i.e. according
        authentication mechanisms.
     FIA_UAU.4/PACE, Single-use authentication mechanisms - Single-use
        authentication of the Terminal by the TOE
     FIA_UAU.5/PACE, Multiple authentication mechanisms to support user
        authentication. The TOE provides multiple authentication mechanisms,
        PACE, symmetric key based authentication mechanism, etc.
     FIA_UAU.6/PACE, Re-authenticating of Terminal by the TOE. The TOE re-
        authenticates the connected terminal, if a secure messaging error
        occurred.

                       The justification related to the policy “Additional Specific Security Components (P.Add-
                       Components)” is detailed below.
                       The justification related to the threat “Unauthorised Memory or Hardware Access
                       (T.Unauthorised-Access)” is as follows:
                       According to O.FM_FW, O.MEM_ACCESS and O.SFR_ACCESS the TOE must enforce
                       the partitioning of memory areas in Firmware Mode, System Mode and User Mode and
                       enforce the segmentation of the memory areas in User Mode so that access of software
                       to memory areas is controlled. Any restrictions have to be defined by the Security IC
                       Embedded Software. Thereby security violations caused by accidental or deliberate
                       access to restricted data (which may include code) can be prevented (refer to
                       T.Unauthorised-Access). The threat T.Unauthorised-Access is therefore covered by the
                       objective.
                       The clarification of “Usage of Hardware Platform (OE.Plat-Appl)” makes clear that it is up
                       to the Security IC Embedded Software to implement the memory management scheme by
                       appropriately administrating the TSF. This is also expressed both in T.Unauthorised-
                       Access and O.FM_FW, O.MEM_ACCESS and O.SFR_ACCESS. The TOE shall provide
                       access control functions to be used by the Security IC Embedded Software. This is further
                       emphasised by the clarification of “Treatment of User Data (OE.Resp-Appl)” which reminds
                       that the Security IC Embedded Software must not undermine the restrictions of the
                       hardware platform. Therefore, the clarifications contribute to the coverage of the threat
                       T.Unauthorised-Access.
                       The justification related to the security objectives O.HW_DES3, O.HW_AES,
                       O.CUST_RECONFIG and O.EEPROM_INTEGRITY is as follows: Since these objectives
                       require the TOE to implement exactly the same specific security functionality as required
                       by P.Add-Components, the organisational security policy is covered by the objectives.
                       Nevertheless the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing, O.Malfunction,
                       O.Phys-Manipulation and O.Leak-Forced define how to implement the specific security
                       functionality required by P.Add-Components. These security objectives are also valid for
                       the additional specific security functionality since they must avert the related threats also
                       for the components added related to the policy.
                       The requirements for a multi-application platform necessitate the separation of users.
                       Therefore it is volitional that most of the security functionality can not be influenced or used
                       in User Mode.
                       The justification related to the assumption A.Key-Function is as follows:
                           • Compared to [6] a clarification has been made for the security objective “Usage of
                             Hardware Platform (OE.Plat-Appl)”: If required the Security IC Embedded Software
                             shall use the cryptographic service of the TOE and its interface as specified. In
                             addition, the Security IC Embedded Software (i) must implement operations on keys
                             (if any) in such a manner that they do not disclose information about confidential data
                             and (ii) must configure the memory management in a way that different applications

                                                                                                                      Security Target Lite



                             are sufficiently separated. If the Security IC Embedded Software uses random
                             numbers provided by the security service SS.RNG these random numbers must be
                             tested as appropriate for the intended purpose. This addition ensures that the
                             assumption A.Key-Function is still covered by the objective OE.Plat-Appl although
                             additional functions are being supported according to P.Add-Components.
                           • Compared to [6] a clarification has been made for the security objective “Treatment of
                             User Data (OE.Resp-Appl)”: By definition cipher or plain text data and cryptographic
                             keys are User Data. So, the Security IC Embedded Software will protect such data if
                             required and use keys and functions appropriately in order to ensure the strength of
                             cryptographic operation. Quality and confidentiality must be maintained for keys that
                             are imported and/or derived from other keys. This implies that appropriate key
                             management has to be implemented in the environment. In addition, the treatment of
                             User Data comprises the implementation of a multi-application operating system that
                             does not disclose security relevant User Data of one application to another one. These
                             measures make sure that the assumption A.Key-Function is still covered by the
                             security objective OE.Resp-Appl although additional functions are being supported
                             according to P.Add-Components.
                       The justification related to the assumption "Check of initialisation data by the Security IC
                       Embedded Software (A.Check-Init)" is as follows:
                       Since OE.Check-Init requires the Security IC Embedded Software developer to implement
                       a function assumed in A.Check-Init, the assumption is covered by the objective.
                       The justification of the additional policy and the additional assumptions show that they do
                       not contradict to the rationale already given in the PP [6] for the assumptions, policy and
                       threats defined there.

5. Extended Components Definition
                       This Security Target does not define extended components.
                       Note that the PP “Security IC Protection Profile” [6] defines extended security functional
                       requirements in chapter 5, which are included in this Security Target.
                       The extended component definition used for Random Number Generator has been taken
                       from [8].

6. Security Requirements
                       This part of the Security Target defines the detailed security requirements that shall be
                       satisfied by the TOE. The statement of TOE security requirements shall define the
                       functional and assurance security requirements that the TOE needs to satisfy in order to
                       meet the security objectives for the TOE. This chapter consists of the sections “Security
                       Functional Requirements”, “Security Assurance Requirements” and “Security
                       Requirements Rationale”.
                       The CC allows several operations to be performed on security requirements (on the
                       component level); refinement, selection, assignment, and iteration are defined in
                       paragraph 8.1 of Part 1 of the CC [1]. These operations are used in the PP [6] and in this
                       Security Target, respectively.
                       The refinement operation is used to add details to requirements, and, thus, further
                       restricts a requirement. Refinements of security requirements are denoted in such a way
                       that added words are in bold text and changed words are crossed out.
                       The selection operation is used to select one or more options provided by the PP [6] or
                       CC in stating a requirement. Selections having been made are denoted as italic text.
                       The assignment operation is used to assign a specific value to an unspecified
                       parameter, such as the length of a password. Assignments having been made are
                       denoted by showing as italic text.
                       The iteration operation is used when a component is repeated with varying operations. It
                       is denoted by showing brackets “[iteration indicator]” and the iteration indicator within the
                       brackets.
                       For the sake of a better readability, the iteration operation may also be applied to some
                       single components (being not repeated) in order to indicate belonging of such SFRs to
                       same functional cluster. In such a case, the iteration operation is applied to only one
                       single component.
                       Whenever an element in the PP [6] contains an operation that the PP author left
                       uncompleted, the ST author has to complete that operation.

                 6.1 Security Functional Requirements
                       The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) of the TOE are presented in the following
                       sections to support a better understanding of the combination of PP “Security IC
                       Protection Profile” [6] and Security Target.
                  6.1.1 SFRs of the Protection Profile
                       Table 21 below shows all SFRs, which are specified in the PP [6] (in the order of definition
                       in the PP). Some of the SFRs are CC Part 2 extended and defined in the PP [6]. This is
                       shown in the third column of the table.

                       The operations for all SFR except for the SFR FAU_SAS.1 and FCS_RNG.1 are already
                       performed in the PP [6]. They are not changed compared to the Protection Profile. The
                       open assignments and selections for FAU_SAS.1 and FCS_RNG.1 are included in the
                       following.
                       For the SFR FAU_SAS.1 the PP [6] leaves the assignment operation open for the
                       non-volatile memory type in which initialisation data, pre-personalisation data and/or other
                       supplements for the Security IC Embedded Software are stored. This assignment

                       For FCS_RNG.1.1 the PP [6] partially fills in the assignment for the security capabilities of
                       the RNG by requiring a total failure test of the random source and adds an assignment
                       operation for additional security capabilities of the RNG.
                       In addition, for FCS_RNG.1.2 the PP [6] partially fills in the assignment operation for the
                       defined quality metric for the random numbers by replacing it by a selection and
                       assignment operation.
                       For the above operations the original operations defined in chapter 5 of the PP [6] have
                       been replaced by operations defined in chapter 3 of [8] and the open operations of the
                       partially filled in operations in the statement of the security requirements in section 4.4 of

                       The Access Control Policy has some implications, that can be drawn from the policy and
                       that are essential parts of the TOE security functionality.
                            • Code executed in Boot Mode or Test Mode is quite powerful and used to configure
                              and test the TOE.
                            • Code executed in Firmware Mode is separated from code executed in System Mode
                              or User Mode. The separation is enforced by the partition of the memories provided
                              by the Memory Management Unit. Only small memory areas are used for data
                              exchange between the Firmware Operating System and the Security IC Embedded
                              Software. Furthermore, the exchange area in RAM is fully controlled by code running
                              in System Mode. The EEPROM data integrity function executed in Firmware Mode has
                              access to the whole EEPROM area to guarantee data integrity for EEPROM write
                              operations. Other Firmware functions have only access to a separated dedicated area
                              in the EEPROM. Separation is realized by means of a Firmware Firewall.
                            • Code executed in the System Mode can administrate the configuration of Memory
                              Management Unit, because it has access to the respective Special Function Registers.
                              Configuration means that the code can change the address of the MMU Segment
                              Table and also modify the contents of it (as long as the table is located in write-able
                              memory).
                            • Code executed in the User Mode cannot administrate the configuration of the Memory
                              Management Unit, because it has no access to the Special Function Registers to
                              configure the MMU segmentation. Therefore, changing the pointer to the MMU

                        • OSP.SECURE-BOX
                        The Organizational Security Policy (OSP) OSP.PROCESS-TOE is introduced for the pre-
                        personalisation feature of the TOE and is an addition to the OSPs in PP [6]. This OSP is
                        copied from the Security IC PP [5].
                        The OSP OSP.KEY-CHANGE is introduced for the Security Domain (SD) feature of the
                        TOE and is an addition to the OSPs in PP [6].
                        The OSP OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS is introduced for the SD feature of the TOE and is
                        an addition to the OSPs in PP [6].
                        The OSP.SECURE-BOX is introduced to allow execution of third party native code and is
                        an addition to the OSPs in PP [6].

                 2.4.2.3 Assumptions

                        The SPD statement includes two of the three assumptions from the PP [6]. The
                        assumption A.Deletion is excluded. The Card Manager is part of the TOE and therefore
                        the assumption is no longer relevant. Leaving out the assumption, makes the SPD of this
                        ST more restrictive than the SPD in the PP [6]. As the Card Manager is part of the TOE,
                        it is ensuring that the deletion of applets through the Card Manager is secure, instead of
                        assuming that it is handled by the Card Manager in the environment of the TOE.
                        Besides the assumptions from the PP [6], following additional assumptions are added:
                        •   A.PROCESS-SEC-IC
                        •   A.USE_DIAG
                        •   A.USE_KEYS
                        •   A.APPS-PROVIDER
                        •   A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY
                        The assumption A.PROCESS-SEC-IC is taken from the underlying certified Micro
                        Controller [10], which is compliant to the Security IC PP [5].
                        The assumptions A.USE_DIAG and A.USE_KEYS are included because the Card
                        Manager is part of the TOE and no longer part of the environment.
                        The assumptions A.APPS-PROVIDER and A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY are added
                        because Security Domains from the GlobalPlatform Specification are introduced. All the
                        applets and packages are signed by the Application Provider Security Domain (APSD)
                        and the correctness is verified on the TOE by Verification Authority Security Domain
                        (VASD) before the package or applet is installed or loaded. A.APPS-PROVIDER and
                        A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY are additions to PP [6] for card content management
                        environment.

                  2.4.3 Security Objectives Statement
                        The statement of security objectives in the ST presented in Section 5 "Security
                        Objectives" includes all security objectives as presented in the PP [6], but also includes a
                        number of additional security objectives. These security objectives are:
                        • OT.IDENTIFICATION
                        • OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS
                        • OT.APPLI-AUTH

                      •   OT.SECURE_ACTIVATION_ADDITIONAL_CODE
                      •   OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION
                      The security objective OT.IDENTIFICATION is part of the security objectives of the
                      certified Micro Controller [10] (see also Section 1.3.1.1 "Micro Controller") and Crypto
                      Lib [10] (see also Section 1.3.1.2.2 "Crypto Library"), which are also components of this
                      composite certification. Therefore the security objective statement is equivalent to the PP
                      [6] for these two security objectives. OT.IDENTIFICATION is also included for the pre-
                      personalisation feature of the TOE, which is additional functionality the PP allows.
                      The security objectives OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS, OT.APPLI-AUTH, OT.COMM_AUTH,
                      OT.COMM_INTEGRITY, OT.COMM_CONFIDENTIALITY are objectives for the TOE as
                      the GlobalPlatform API and the definitions for Secure Channel, Security Domains and
                      Card Content Management are used from it.
                      The security objectives OT.CARD-CONFIGURATION, OT.SECURE_LOAD_ACODE,
                      OT.SECURE_ACTIVATION_ADDITIONAL_CODE, OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION are
                      related to the configuration of the TOE via the Configuration Module, which is additional
                      functionality the PP [6] allows.
                      The security objective OT.SEC_BOX_FW is related to the Secure Box, which is
                      additional functionality the PP allows.
                      The security objective OT.SID_MODULE is related to the Modular Design of the TOE,
                      which is additional functionality the PP [6] allows.
                      The security objective OT.RNG is related to the Random Number Generator, and is
                      taken from the Security IC PP [5].
                      The ST contains OE.APPLET, OE.VERIFICATION and OE.CODE-EVIDENCE from
                      Security Objectives for the Operational Environment from [6]. Additionally, some of the
                      Security Objectives for the Operational Environment from [6] are listed as TOE Security
                      Objectives in this ST:
                      •   OT.SCP.RECOVERY instead of OE.SCP.RECOVERY
                      •   OT.SCP.SUPPORT instead of OE.SCP.SUPPORT
                      •   OT.SCP.IC instead of OE.SCP.IC
                      •   OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT instead of OE.CARD-MANAGEMENT
                      OT.SCP.RECOVERY, OT.SCP.SUPPORT, and OT.SCP.IC are objectives for the
                      TOE as the Smart Card Platform belongs to the TOE for this evaluation. OT.CARD-
                      MANAGEMENT is an objective for the TOE as the Card Manager belongs to the TOE
                      for this evaluation. Moving objectives from the environment to the TOE adds objectives
                      to the TOE without changing the overall objectives. The statement of security objectives
                      is therefore equivalent to the security objectives in the PP [6] to which conformance is
                      claimed.

                       The security objectives O.INSTALL, O.LOAD, and O.DELETION from the PP [6] are not
                       included since these functionality and objectives are covered by the refined OT.CARD-
                       MANAGEMENT.
                       Note that the objective O.REMOTE is not included, since the TOE does not support Java
                       Card RMI. The Java Card Protection Profile makes the use of Java Card RMI optional.
                       A part of the security objectives for the environment defined in the PP [6] has been
                       included in this ST. The other part of security objectives for the environment, which is
                       present in the PP [6], is used as part of the security objectives for the TOE in this ST. The
                       ST also introduces following additional security objectives for the environment:
                       •   OE.PROCESS_SEC_IC
                       •   OE.USE_DIAG
                       •   OE.USE_KEYS
                       •   OE.APPS-PROVIDER
                       •   OE.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY
                       •   OE.KEY-CHANGE
                       •   OE.SECURITY-DOMAINS
                       The security objective for the environment OE.PROCESS_SEC_IC is from the hardware
                       platform (Micro Controller [10] see also Section 1.3.1.1 "Micro Controller") that is part of
                       this composite product evaluation. Therefore the statement of security objectives for the
                       environment is equivalent to the statement in the Security IC PP [5].
                       OE.USE_KEYS and OE.USE_DIAG are included because the Card Manager is part of
                       the TOE and not a security objective for the environment as in PP [6].
                       OE.APPS-PROVIDER and OE.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY cover trusted actors which
                       enable the creation, distribution and verification of secure applications.
                       OE.KEY-CHANGE covers the switch to trusted keys for the AP.
                       OE.SECURITY-DOMAINS covers the management of security domains in the context of
                       the GlobalPlatform Specification.
                       The statement of security objectives for the environment is therefore considered to be
                       equivalent to the security objectives in the PP [6] to which conformance is claimed.

                 2.4.4 Security Functional Requirements Statement
                       The statement of security functional requirements copies most SFRs as defined in the
                       PP [6], with the exception of a number of options. For the copied set of SFRs the ST is
                       considered equivalent to the statement of SFRs in the PP [6]. Moreover as requested
                       by the PP [6] the ST adds additional threats, objectives and SFRs to fully cover and
                       describe additional security functionality implemented in the TOE.
                       The TOE does not implement Java Card RMI, therefore this ST restricts remote access
                       from the CAD to the services implemented by the applets on the card to none. As a
                       result the SFRs concerning Java Card RMI (FDP_ACF.1/JCRMI, FDP_IFC.1/JCRMI,
                       FDP_IFF.1/JCRMI, FMT_MSA.1/EXPORT, FMT_MSA.1/REM_ REFS, FMT_MSA.3/
                       JCRMI, FMT_SMF.1/JCRMI, FMT_REV.1/JCRMI, and FMT_SMR.1/JCRMI) are not
                       included in the ST. In the PP [6] the use of the Java Card RMI is optional.
                       The SFR FDP_ITC.2/INSTALLER from the PP [6] is replaced by FDP_ITC.2[CCM] which
                       enforces the Security Domain access control policy and the Secure Channel Protocol
                       information flow policy and which are more restrictive than the PACKAGE LOADING
                       information flow control SFP from PP [6].

                      The set of SFRs that define the card content management mechanism CarG are partly
                      replaced or refined and are considered to be equivalent or more restrictive because of
                      the newly introduced SFPs:
                      1. Security Domain access control policy,
                      2. Secure Channel Protocol information flow policy

3       Security Aspects
                       This Chapter describes the main security issues of the Java Card System and its
                       environment addressed in this ST, called "security aspects", in a CC-independent way.
                       In addition to this, they also give a semi-formal framework to express the CC security
                       environment and objectives of the TOE. They can be instantiated as assumptions,
                       threats, objectives (for the TOE and the environment) or organizational security policies.
                       The description is based on [6].
                       This chapters described only the Security Aspects which have been added in comparison
                       to the PP [6].

                  3.1 Integrity

                 3.1.1 SA.INTEG-APPLI-DATA-PHYS: Integrity of Application Data (Sensitive
                       Result)
                       Integrity-sensitive application data must be protected against unauthorized modification
                       by physical attacks.

                  3.2 Configuration Module

                 3.2.1 SA.CONFIGURATION-MODULE: Configuration Module
                       The Configuration Module is a JCOP functionality which allows to read and modify
                       configuration items in the configuration area of the TOE.

                  3.3 Modular Design

                 3.3.1 SA.MODULAR-DESIGN: Modular Design
                       The TOE might contain one or more Modules implementing particular functionality. The
                       list of Modules present in the TOE must be retrievable. The Modules have an associated
                       AID which allows to identify them. The AID is equivalent to the Package AID of JavaCard
                       packages. Modules can only be deleted, re-loading of a previously deleted module or
                       replacing a present module must not be possible. Interfaces to a Module can be Public
                       or TOE internal. Public Interfaces can directly be accessed by any Applet or via an
                       APDU, TOE internal interfaces can only be accessed by the TOE itself, Applets use the
                       corresponding JavaCard API [14].

                 3.3.2 SA.MODULE-INVOCATION: Module Invocation
                       Invoking a module must be transparent to the user. If a Module has a TOE internal
                       interface, is not present and is invoked by the user, the TOE must preserve a secure
                       state by throwing an exception or returning an appropriate error status word to the CAD.

4       Security Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)
                       The Security Problem Definition is described within the following sections. Only additional
                       and refined items compared to the PP [6] are described.

                  4.1 Assets
                       Assets are security-relevant elements to be directly protected by the TOE. Confidentiality
                       of assets is always intended with respect to un-trusted people or software, as various
                       parties are involved during the first stages of the smart card product life-cycle. Details
                       concerning the threats are given in Section 4.2 "Threats" hereafter.
                       Assets have to be protected, some in terms of confidentiality and some in terms of
                       integrity or both integrity and confidentiality. These assets might get compromised by the
                       threats that the TOE is exposed to.
                       The assets to be protected by the TOE are listed below. They are grouped according to
                       whether it is data created by and for the user (User data) or data created by and for the
                       TOE (TSF data). This definition of grouping is taken from Section 5.1 of [6].

                                                          with the AP. These keys can be used to load and install applications
                                                          on the card if the Security Domain has the appropriate privileges. To

                 4.2.1.1 T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA[REFINED]: Integrity of Application Data

                        The attacker executes an application to alter (part of) another application’s data.
                        Directly threatened asset(s): D.APP_I_ DATA, D.PIN, D.APP_KEYS, D.ISD_KEYS,
                        D.VASD_KEYS and S.APSD_KEYS.
                        This threat is a refinement of the Threat T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA from [6].

                  4.2.2 Unauthorized Execution

                 4.2.2.1 T.MODULE_EXEC: Code Execution of Modules

                        The attacker bypasses the presence check of a Module which is not present with
                        TOE internal interface to execute arbitrary code. See SA.MODULAR-DESIGN and
                        SA.MODULE-INVOCATION for details. Directly threatened asset(s): D.MODULE_

                  4.2.3 Card Management

                 4.2.3.1 T.UNAUTHORIZED_CARD_MNGT: Unauthorized Card Management

                        The attacker performs unauthorized card management operations (for instance
                        impersonates one of the actor represented on the card) in order to take benefit of the
                        privileges or services granted to this actor on the card such as fraudulent:
                        •   load of a package file
                        •   installation of a package file
                        •   extradition of a package file or an applet
                        •   personalization of an applet or a Security Domain
                        •   deletion of a package file or an applet
                        •   privileges update of an applet or a Security Domain
                        Directly threatened asset(s): D.ISD_KEYS, D.APSD_KEYS, D.APP_C_DATA, D.APP_
                        I_DATA, D.APP_CODE, D.SEC_DATA, and D.CARD_MNGT_DATA (any other asset
                        may be jeopardized should this attack succeed, depending on the virulence of the
                        installed application).
                        This security objective is a refinement of the Threats T.INSTALL and T.DELETION from
                        [6].

                 4.2.3.2 T.COM_EXPLOIT: Communication Channel Remote Exploit

                        An attacker remotely exploits the communication channels established between a third
                        party and the TOE in order to modify or disclose confidential data.
                        All assets are threatened.

                 4.2.3.3 T.LIFE_CYCLE: Life Cycle

                        An attacker accesses to an application outside of its expected availability range thus
                        violating irreversible life cycle phases of the application (for instance, an attacker

                  4.2.4 Operating System

                 4.2.4.1 T.OS_OPERATE: Incorrect Operating System Behavior

                        Modification of the correct OS behavior by unauthorized use of TOE or use of incorrect
                        or unauthorized instructions or commands or sequence of commands, in order to obtain
                        an unauthorized execution of the TOE code. An attacker may cause a malfunction of TSF
                        or of the Smart Card embedded OS in order to (1) by-pass the security mechanisms (i.e.
                        authentication or access control mechanisms) or (2) obtain unexpected result from the
                        embedded OS behavior. Different kind of attack path may be used as:
                        1. Applying incorrect unexpected or unauthorized instructions, commands or command
                           sequences,
                        2. Provoking insecure state by insertion of interrupt (reset), premature termination of
                           transaction or communication between IC and the reading device.
                        Info: Any implementation flaw in the OS itself can be exploited with this attack path
                        to lead to an unsecured state of the state machine of the OS. The attacker uses the
                        available interfaces of the TOE. A user could have certain specified privileges that allow
                        loading of selected programs. Unauthorized programs, if allowed to be loaded, may
                        include either the execution of legitimate programs not intended for use during normal
                        operation (such as patches, filters, Trojan horses, etc.) or the unauthorized loading of
                        programs specifically targeted at penetration or modification of the security functions.
                        Attempts to generate a non-secure state in the Smart Card may also be made through
                        premature termination of transactions or communications between the IC and the card
                        reading device, by insertion of interrupts, or by selecting related applications that may
                        leave files open.

                  4.2.5 Random Numbers

                 4.2.5.1 T.RND: Deficiency of Random Numbers

                        An attacker may predict or obtain information about random numbers generated by
                        the TOE for instance because of a lack of entropy of the random numbers provided.
                        An attacker may gather information about the produced random numbers which might
                        be a problem because they may be used for instance to generate cryptographic keys.
                        Here the attacker is expected to take advantage of statistical properties of the random
                        numbers generated by the TOE without specific knowledge about the TOE’s generator.
                        Malfunctions or premature ageing are also considered which may assist in getting
                        information about random numbers.

                  4.2.6 Configuration Module

                 4.2.6.1 T.CONFIG: Unauthorized configuration

                        The attacker tries to change configuration items without authorization. Directly threatened
                        asset(s): D.CONFIG_ITEM.

                        An attacker may try to use malicious code placed in the Secure Box to modify the correct
                        behavior of the Operating System (OS). With the aim to
                        1. disclose the Java Card System code,
                        2. disclose or alter applet code, disclose or alter Java Card System data, or disclose or

                  4.2.8 Module replacement

                 4.2.8.1 T.MODULE_REPLACEMENT: Replacement of Module

                        An attacker loads a Module with functionality differing from a previously deleted Module
                        to bypass TOE Security Functions. See SA.MODULAR-DESIGN for details. Directly
                        threatened assets: D.JCS_DATA.

                   4.3 Organisational Security Policies

                  4.3.1 OSP.PROCESS-TOE: Identification of the TOE
                        An accurate identification must be established for the TOE. This requires that each
                        instantiation of the TOE carries this identification.

                  4.3.2 OSP.KEY-CHANGE: Security Domain Keys Change
                        The Application Provider (AP) shall change its initial security domain keys (APSD) before
                        any operation on its Security Domain.

                  4.3.3 OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS: Security Domains
                        Security domains can be dynamically created, deleted and blocked during usage phase
                        in post-issuance mode.

                  4.3.4 OSP.SECURE-BOX: Secure Box Border
                        Execution of untrusted native code shall be possible without any harm, manipulation, or
                        influence on other parts of the TOE.

                   4.4 Assumptions
                        Note that the assumption A.DELETION is excluded. The Card Manager is part of the
                        TOE and therefore the assumption is no longer relevant.

                  4.4.1 A.USE_DIAG: Usage of TOE’s Secure Communication Protocol by OE
                        It is assumed that the operational environment supports and uses the secure
                        communication protocols offered by the TOE.

                 4.4.2 A.USE_KEYS: Protected Storage of Keys Outside of TOE
                       It is assumed that the keys which are stored outside the TOE and which are used for
                       secure communication and authentication between Smart Card and terminals are
                       protected for confidentiality and integrity in their own storage environment. This is
                       especially true for D.APSD_KEYS, D.ISD_KEYS, and D.VASD_KEYS.
                       Info: This is to assume that the keys used in terminals or systems are correctly
                       protected for confidentiality and integrity in their own environment, as the disclosure of
                       such information which is shared with the TOE but is not under the TOE control, may
                       compromise the security of the TOE.

                 4.4.3 A.PROCESS-SEC-IC: Protection during Packaging, Finishing and
                       Personalisation
                       It is assumed that security procedures are used after delivery of the TOE by the TOE
                       Manufacturer up to delivery to the end consumer to maintain confidentiality and integrity
                       of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test data (to prevent any possible copy,
                       modification, retention, theft or unauthorised use). This means that the Phases after TOE
                       Delivery are assumed to be protected appropriately.
                       The assets to be protected are: The information and material produced and/or processed
                       by the Security IC Embedded Software Developer in Phase 1 and by the Composite
                       Product Manufacturer can be grouped as follows:
                       1. the Security IC Embedded Software including specifications, implementation and
                          related documentation,
                       2. pre-personalisation and personalisation data including specifications of formats and
                          memory areas, test related data,
                       3. the User Data and related documentation, and
                       4. material for software development support
                       as long as they are not under the control of the TOE Manufacturer.

                 4.4.4 A.APPS-PROVIDER: Application Provider
                       The AP is a trusted actor that provides basic or secure applications. He is responsible for
                       his security domain keys (APSD keys).
                       Info: An AP generally refers to the entity that issues the application. For instance it can
                       be a financial institution for a payment application such as EMV or a transport operator
                       for a transport application.

                 4.4.5 A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY: Verification Authority
                       The VA is a trusted actor who is able to guarantee and check the digital signature
                       attached to a basic or secure application.
                       Info: As a consequence, it guarantees the success of the application validation upon
                       loading.

5       Security Objectives
                        The Security Objectives for the TOE, for the operational environment and the security
                        objectives rationale are described within the following sections. Only additional and
                        refined items compared to the PP [6] are described.

                   5.1 Security Objectives for the TOE

                  5.1.1 Identification

                 5.1.1.1 OT.SID_MODULE: Subject Identification of Modules

                        The TOE shall uniquely identify every Module before granting it access to any service.

                  5.1.2 Execution

                 5.1.2.1 OT.SENSITIVE_RESULTS_INTEG: Sensitive Result

                        The TOE shall ensure that the sensitive results
                        (com.nxp.id.jcopx.security.SensitiveResultX) of sensitive operations executed by
                        applications through the Java Card API are protected in integrity specifically against
                        physical attacks.

                  5.1.3 Services

                 5.1.3.1 OT.RNG: Random Numbers Generation

                        The TOE shall ensure the cryptographic quality of random number generation. For
                        instance random numbers shall not be predictable and shall have sufficient entropy. The
                        TOE shall ensure that no information about the produced random numbers is available to
                        an attacker since they might be used for instance to generate cryptographic keys.

                  5.1.4 Applet Management

                 5.1.4.1 OT.APPLI-AUTH: Application Authentication

                        The card manager shall enforce the application security policies established by the card
                        issuer by requiring application authentication during application loading on the card. This
                        security objective is a refinement of the Security Objective O.LOAD from [6].
                        AppNote: Each application loaded onto the TOE has been signed by a VA. The VA
                        will guarantee that the security policies established by the card issuer on applications
                        are enforced. For example this authority (DAP) or a third party (Mandated DAP) can
                        be present on the TOE as a Security Domain whose role is to verify each signature at
                        application loading.

                 5.1.4.2 OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS: Domain Rights

                        The Card issuer shall not get access or change personalized AP Security Domain keys
                        which belong to the AP. Modification of a Security Domain keyset is restricted to the AP
                        who owns the security domain.

                        AppNote: APs have a set of keys that allows them to establish a secure channel between
                        them and the platform. These keys sets are not known by the TOE issuer. The security
                        domain initial keys are changed before any operation on the SD (OE.KEY-CHANGE).

                 5.1.4.3 OT.COMM_AUTH: Communication Mutual Authentication

                        The TOE shall authenticate the origin of the card management requests that the card
                        receives, and authenticate itself to the remote actor.

                 5.1.4.4 OT.COMM_INTEGRITY: Communication Request Integrity

                        The TOE shall verify the integrity of the card management requests that the card
                        receives.

                 5.1.4.5 OT.COMM_CONFIDENTIALITY: Communication Request Confidentiality

                        The TOE shall be able to process card management requests containing encrypted data.

                  5.1.5 Card Management

                 5.1.5.1 OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT: Card Management

                        The TOE shall provide card management functionalities (loading, installation, extradition,
                        deletion of applications and GP registry updates) in charge of the life cycle of the whole
                        device and installed applications (applets). The card manager, the application with
                        specific rights responsible for the administration of the smart card, shall control the
                        access to card management functions. It shall also implement the card issuer’s policy on
                        card management.
                        The Security Objective from [6] for the environment OE.CARD-MANAGEMENT is listed
                        as TOE Security Objective OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT for the TOE as the Card Manager
                        belongs to the TOE for this evaluation. This security objective is a refinement for the
                        Security Objectives O.INSTALL, O.LOAD, and O.DELETION from [6]. Thus, the following
                        objectives are also covered:
                        • The TOE shall ensure that the installation of an applet performs as expected (See
                          SA.INSTALL for details).
                        • The TOE shall ensure that the loading of a package into the card is secure.
                        • The TOE shall ensure that the deletion of a package from the TOE is secure.
                        AppNote: The card manager will be tightly connected in practice with the rest of the TOE,
                        which in return shall very likely rely on the card manager for the effective enforcement
                        of some of its security functions. The mechanism used to ensure authentication of
                        the TOE issuer, that manages the TOE, or of the Service Providers owning a Security
                        Domain with card management privileges is a secure channel. This channel will be
                        used afterwards to protect commands exchanged with the TOE in confidentiality and
                        integrity. The platform guarantees that only the ISD or the Service Providers owning a
                        Security Domain with the appropriate privilege (Delegated Management) can manage the
                        applications on the card associated with its Security Domain. This is done accordingly
                        with the card issuer’s policy on card management. The actor performing the operation
                        must beforehand authenticate with the Security Domain. In the case of Delegated
                        Management, the card management command will be associated with an electronic
                        signature (GlobalPlatform token) verified by the ISD before execution.
                        The Security Objective from [6] for the environment OE.CARD-MANAGEMENT is listed

                         belongs to the TOE for this evaluation. This security objective is a refinement for the
                         Security Objectives O.INSTALL, O.LOAD, and O.DELETION from [6]. Thus, the following
                         AppNote applicable to O.DELETION applies also:
                         • Usurpation of identity resulting from a malicious installation of an applet on the card
                           may also be the result of perturbing the communication channel linking the CAD and
                           the card. Even if the CAD is placed in a secure environment, the attacker may try to
                           capture, duplicate, permute or modify the packages sent to the card. He may also try to
                           send one of its own applications as if it came from the card issuer. Thus, this objective
                           is intended to ensure the integrity and authenticity of loaded CAP files.

                  5.1.6 Smart Card Platform

                 5.1.6.1 OT.SCP.IC IC: Physical Protection

                         The SCP shall provide all IC security features against physical attacks. This security
                         objective for the environment refers to the point (7) of the security aspect SA.SCP.
                         AppNote: The Security Objectives from [6] for the environment OE.SCP.RECOVERY,
                         OE.SCP.SUPPORT, and OE.SCP.IC are listed as TOE Security Objectives
                         (OT.SCP.RECOVERY, OT.SCP.SUPPORT, and OT.SCP.IC) for the TOE in this section
                         as the Smart Card Platform belongs to the TOE for this evaluation.

                 5.1.6.2 OT.SCP.RECOVERY: SCP Recovery

                         If there is a loss of power, or if the smart card is withdrawn from the CAD while an
                         operation is in progress, the SCP must allow the TOE to eventually complete the
                         interrupted operation successfully, or recover to a consistent and secure state. This
                         security objective for the environment refers to the security aspect SA.SCP.
                         AppNote: The Security Objectives from [6] for the environment OE.SCP.RECOVERY,
                         OE.SCP.SUPPORT, and OE.SCP.IC are listed as TOE Security Objectives

                 5.1.6.3 OT.SCP.SUPPORT: SCP Support

                         The SCP shall support the TSFs of the TOE. This security objective refers to the security
                         aspects 2, 3, 4 and 5 of SA.SCP.
                         AppNote: The Security Objectives from [6] for the environment OE.SCP.RECOVERY,

                 5.1.6.4 OT.IDENTIFICATION: TOE identification

                         The TOE must provide means to store Initialization Data and Pre-personalization Data
                         in its non-volatile memory. The Initialization Data (or parts of them) are used for TOE
                         identification.

                 5.1.7.1 OT.SEC_BOX_FW: SecureBox firewall

                        The TOE shall provide separation between the Secure Box native code and the Java
                        Card System. The separation shall comprise software execution and data access.

                  5.1.8 Configuration Module

                 5.1.8.1 OT.CARD-CONFIGURATION: Card Configuration

                        The TOE shall ensure that the customer can only configure customer configuration items
                        and that NXP can configure customer and NXP configuration items.

                 5.1.8.2 OT.SECURE_LOAD_ACODE: Secure loading of the Additional Code

                        This objective is taken over from [8].
                        The Loader of the Initial TOE shall check an evidence of authenticity and integrity of the
                        loaded Additional Code.
                        The Loader enforces that only the allowed version of the Additional Code can be loaded
                        on the Initial TOE. The Loader shall forbid the loading of an Additional Code not intended
                        to be assembled with the Initial TOE.
                        During the Load Phase of an Additional Code, the TOE shall remain secure.

                 5.1.8.3 OT.SECURE_ACTIVATION_ADDITIONAL_CODE: Secure activation of the
                         Additional Code

                        This objective is taken over from [8] (O.Secure_AC_Activation) with editorial modification.
                        Activation of the Additional Code and update of the Identification Data shall be performed
                        at the same time in an Atomic way.
                        All the operations needed for the code to be able to operate as in the Final TOE shall be
                        completed before activation.
                        If the Atomic Activation is successful, then the resulting product is the Final TOE,
                        otherwise (in case of interruption or incident which prevents the forming of the Final
                        TOE), the Initial TOE shall remain in its initial state or fail secure.

                 5.1.8.4 OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION: Secure identification of the TOE

                        This objective is taken over from [8] and further refined.
                        The Identification Data identifies the Initial TOE and Additional Code. The TOE provides
                        means to store Identification Data in its non-volatile memory and guarantees the integrity
                        of these data.
                        After Atomic Activation of the Additional Code, the Identification Data of the Final TOE
                        allows identifications of Initial TOE and Additional Code or the Final TOE. The user shall
                        be able to uniquely identify Initial TOE and Additional Code(s) or the final TOE which are
                        embedded in the Final TOE.

                  5.2 Security Objectives for the Operational Environment

                 5.2.1 OE.APPS-PROVIDER: Application Provider
                      The AP shall be a trusted actor that provides applications. The AP is responsible for its
                      security domain keys.

                 5.2.2 OE.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY: Verification Authority
                      The VA should be a trusted actor who is able to verify bytecode of an application loaded
                      on the card, guarantee and generate the digital signature attached to an application and
                      ensure that its public key for verifying the application signature is on the TOE.

                 5.2.3 OE.PROCESS_SEC_IC: Protection during composite product
                       manufacturing
                      Security procedures shall be used after TOE Delivery up to delivery to the end-consumer
                      to maintain confidentiality and integrity of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test
                      data (to prevent any possible copy, modification, retention, theft or unauthorised use).
                      This means that Phases after TOE Delivery up to the end of Phase 6 must be protected
                      appropriately.

                 5.2.4 OE.KEY-CHANGE: Security Domain Key Change
                      The AP must change its security domain initial keys before any operation on it.

                 5.2.5 OE.SECURITY-DOMAINS: Security Domains
                      Security domains can be dynamically created, deleted and blocked during usage phase
                      in post-issuance mode.

                 5.2.6 OE.USE_DIAG: Secure TOE communication protocols
                      Secure TOE communication protocols shall be supported and used by the environment.

                 5.2.7 OE.USE_KEYS: Protection of OPE keys
                      During the TOE usage, the terminal or system in interaction with the TOE shall ensure
                      the protection (integrity and confidentiality) of their own keys by operational means and/or
                      procedures.

                  5.3 Security Objectives Rationale
                      In this section it is proven that the security objectives described in Section 4 "Security
                      Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)" can be traced for all aspects identified in the TOE-
                      security environment and that they are suited to cover them. At least one security
                      objective results from each assumption, OSP, and each threat. At least one threat, one
                      OSP or assumption exists for each security objective.

                      The component FCS_RNG is taken over from the Java Card PP [6]. In addition following
                      components are defined for the TOE.

                      Platform Protection profile [5].
                      To define the security functional requirements of the TOE an additional family
                      (FAU_SAS) of the Class FAU (Security Audit) is defined here. This family describes the
                      functional requirements for the storage of audit data. It has a more general approach
                      than FAU_GEN, because it does not necessarily require the data to be generated by
                      the TOE itself and because it does not give specific details of the content of the audit
                      records.
                      The family “Audit data storage (FAU_SAS)” is specified as follows.

                      The TOE shall prevent attacks against the TOE and other secret data where the attack
                      is based on external observable physical phenomena of the TOE. Examples of such
                      attacks are evaluation of TOE’s electromagnetic radiation, simple power analysis (SPA),
                      differential power analysis (DPA), timing attacks, etc. This family describes the functional
                      requirements for the limitation of intelligible emanations which are not directly addressed
                      by any other component of CC part 2 [2].

                      [2]   Due to mathematical weakness only resistant against AVA_VAN.5 for temporary data (e.g. as used for generating session
                            keys), but not if repeatedly applied to the same input data.
                      [3]   Available only in the IOT Full variant of the TOE and not on the IOT Reduced variant. See Section 1.3.3 "TOE Reduced

                      For resistance against attackers with High Attack Potential the user should always
                      refer to the guidance given by the Certification Body in the jurisdiction. The website

                          Dependencies:                    No dependencies.

                          Refinement:                      The TSF will implement appropriate mechanisms to continuously
                                                           counter physical manipulation and physical probing. Due to the

                       The Access Control Policy has some implications, that can be drawn from the policy and
                       that are essential parts of the TOE security functionality.
                            • Code executed in Boot Mode or Test Mode is quite powerful and used to configure
                              and test the TOE.
                            • Code executed in Firmware Mode is separated from code executed in System Mode
                              or User Mode. The separation is enforced by the partition of the memories provided
                              by the Memory Management Unit. Only small memory areas are used for data
                              exchange between the Firmware Operating System and the Security IC Embedded
                              Software. Furthermore, the exchange area in RAM is fully controlled by code running
                              in System Mode. The EEPROM data integrity function executed in Firmware Mode has
                              access to the whole EEPROM area to guarantee data integrity for EEPROM write
                              operations. Other Firmware functions have only access to a separated dedicated area
                              in the EEPROM. Separation is realized by means of a Firmware Firewall.
                            • Code executed in the System Mode can administrate the configuration of Memory
                              Management Unit, because it has access to the respective Special Function Registers.
                              Configuration means that the code can change the address of the MMU Segment
                              Table and also modify the contents of it (as long as the table is located in write-able
                              memory).
                            • Code executed in the User Mode cannot administrate the configuration of the Memory
                              Management Unit, because it has no access to the Special Function Registers to
                              configure the MMU segmentation. Therefore, changing the pointer to the MMU
                              Segment Table is not possible.
                            • It may be possible for User Mode code to modify the MMU Segment Table contents if
                              the table itself is residing in a memory location that is part of a Memory Segment that
                              the code has write access to.
                       The TOE shall meet the requirement “Static attribute initialisation (FMT_MSA.3)” as

                          4. The TOE accepts the authentication attempt by means of the Terminal
                          Authentication Protocol v.1 only if the terminal uses the public key presented

                        The Organizational Security Policy (OSP) OSP.PROCESS-TOE is introduced for the pre-
                        personalisation feature of the TOE and is an addition to the OSPs in PP [6]. This OSP is
                        copied from the Security IC PP [5].
                        The OSP OSP.KEY-CHANGE is introduced for the Security Domain (SD) feature of the
                        TOE and is an addition to the OSPs in PP [6].
                        The OSP OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS is introduced for the SD feature of the TOE and is
                        an addition to the OSPs in PP [6].
                        The OSP.SECURE-BOX is introduced to allow execution of third party native code and is
                        an addition to the OSPs in PP [6].

                 2.4.2.3 Assumptions

                        The SPD statement includes two of the three assumptions from the PP [6]. The
                        assumption A.Deletion is excluded. The Card Manager is part of the TOE and therefore
                        the assumption is no longer relevant. Leaving out the assumption, makes the SPD of this
                        ST more restrictive than the SPD in the PP [6]. As the Card Manager is part of the TOE,
                        it is ensuring that the deletion of applets through the Card Manager is secure, instead of
                        assuming that it is handled by the Card Manager in the environment of the TOE.
                        Besides the assumptions from the PP [6], following additional assumptions are added:
                        •   A.PROCESS-SEC-IC
                        •   A.USE_DIAG
                        •   A.USE_KEYS
                        •   A.APPS-PROVIDER
                        •   A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY
                        The assumption A.PROCESS-SEC-IC is taken from the underlying certified Micro
                        Controller [10], which is compliant to the Security IC PP [5].
                        The assumptions A.USE_DIAG and A.USE_KEYS are included because the Card
                        Manager is part of the TOE and no longer part of the environment.
                        The assumptions A.APPS-PROVIDER and A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY are added
                        because Security Domains from the GlobalPlatform Specification are introduced. All the
                        applets and packages are signed by the Application Provider Security Domain (APSD)
                        and the correctness is verified on the TOE by Verification Authority Security Domain
                        (VASD) before the package or applet is installed or loaded. A.APPS-PROVIDER and
                        A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY are additions to PP [6] for card content management
                        environment.

                  2.4.3 Security Objectives Statement
                        The statement of security objectives in the ST presented in Section 5 "Security
                        Objectives" includes all security objectives as presented in the PP [6], but also includes a
                        number of additional security objectives. These security objectives are:
                        • OT.IDENTIFICATION

                      •   OT.SECURE_LOAD_ACODE
                      •   OT.SECURE_ACTIVATION_ADDITIONAL_CODE
                      •   OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION
                      The security objective OT.IDENTIFICATION is part of the security objectives of the
                      certified Micro Controller [10] (see also Section 1.3.1.1 "Micro Controller") and Crypto
                      Lib [10] (see also Section 1.3.1.2.2 "Crypto Library"), which are also components of this
                      composite certification. Therefore the security objective statement is equivalent to the PP
                      [6] for these two security objectives. OT.IDENTIFICATION is also included for the pre-
                      personalisation feature of the TOE, which is additional functionality the PP allows.
                      The security objectives OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS, OT.APPLI-AUTH, OT.COMM_AUTH,
                      OT.COMM_INTEGRITY, OT.COMM_CONFIDENTIALITY are objectives for the TOE as
                      the GlobalPlatform API and the definitions for Secure Channel, Security Domains and
                      Card Content Management are used from it.
                      The security objectives OT.CARD-CONFIGURATION, OT.SECURE_LOAD_ACODE,
                      OT.SECURE_ACTIVATION_ADDITIONAL_CODE, OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION are
                      related to the configuration of the TOE via the Configuration Module, which is additional
                      functionality the PP [6] allows.
                      The security objective OT.SEC_BOX_FW is related to the Secure Box, which is
                      additional functionality the PP allows.
                      The security objective OT.SID_MODULE is related to the Modular Design of the TOE,
                      which is additional functionality the PP [6] allows.
                      The security objective OT.RNG is related to the Random Number Generator, and is
                      taken from the Security IC PP [5].
                      The ST contains OE.APPLET, OE.VERIFICATION and OE.CODE-EVIDENCE from
                      Security Objectives for the Operational Environment from [6]. Additionally, some of the
                      Security Objectives for the Operational Environment from [6] are listed as TOE Security
                      Objectives in this ST:
                      •   OT.SCP.RECOVERY instead of OE.SCP.RECOVERY
                      •   OT.SCP.SUPPORT instead of OE.SCP.SUPPORT
                      •   OT.SCP.IC instead of OE.SCP.IC
                      •   OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT instead of OE.CARD-MANAGEMENT
                      OT.SCP.RECOVERY, OT.SCP.SUPPORT, and OT.SCP.IC are objectives for the
                      TOE as the Smart Card Platform belongs to the TOE for this evaluation. OT.CARD-
                      MANAGEMENT is an objective for the TOE as the Card Manager belongs to the TOE
                      for this evaluation. Moving objectives from the environment to the TOE adds objectives
                      to the TOE without changing the overall objectives. The statement of security objectives
                      is therefore equivalent to the security objectives in the PP [6] to which conformance is
                      claimed.

                       The security objectives O.INSTALL, O.LOAD, and O.DELETION from the PP [6] are not
                       included since these functionality and objectives are covered by the refined OT.CARD-
                       MANAGEMENT.
                       Note that the objective O.REMOTE is not included, since the TOE does not support Java
                       Card RMI. The Java Card Protection Profile makes the use of Java Card RMI optional.
                       A part of the security objectives for the environment defined in the PP [6] has been
                       included in this ST. The other part of security objectives for the environment, which is
                       present in the PP [6], is used as part of the security objectives for the TOE in this ST. The
                       ST also introduces following additional security objectives for the environment:
                       •   OE.PROCESS_SEC_IC
                       •   OE.USE_DIAG
                       •   OE.USE_KEYS
                       •   OE.APPS-PROVIDER
                       •   OE.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY
                       •   OE.KEY-CHANGE
                       •   OE.SECURITY-DOMAINS
                       The security objective for the environment OE.PROCESS_SEC_IC is from the hardware
                       platform (Micro Controller [10] see also Section 1.3.1.1 "Micro Controller") that is part of
                       this composite product evaluation. Therefore the statement of security objectives for the
                       environment is equivalent to the statement in the Security IC PP [5].
                       OE.USE_KEYS and OE.USE_DIAG are included because the Card Manager is part of
                       the TOE and not a security objective for the environment as in PP [6].
                       OE.APPS-PROVIDER and OE.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY cover trusted actors which
                       enable the creation, distribution and verification of secure applications.
                       OE.KEY-CHANGE covers the switch to trusted keys for the AP.
                       OE.SECURITY-DOMAINS covers the management of security domains in the context of
                       the GlobalPlatform Specification.
                       The statement of security objectives for the environment is therefore considered to be
                       equivalent to the security objectives in the PP [6] to which conformance is claimed.

                 2.4.4 Security Functional Requirements Statement
                       The statement of security functional requirements copies most SFRs as defined in the
                       PP [6], with the exception of a number of options. For the copied set of SFRs the ST is
                       considered equivalent to the statement of SFRs in the PP [6]. Moreover as requested
                       by the PP [6] the ST adds additional threats, objectives and SFRs to fully cover and
                       describe additional security functionality implemented in the TOE.
                       The TOE does not implement Java Card RMI, therefore this ST restricts remote access
                       from the CAD to the services implemented by the applets on the card to none. As a
                       result the SFRs concerning Java Card RMI (FDP_ACF.1/JCRMI, FDP_IFC.1/JCRMI,
                       FDP_IFF.1/JCRMI, FMT_MSA.1/EXPORT, FMT_MSA.1/REM_ REFS, FMT_MSA.3/
                       JCRMI, FMT_SMF.1/JCRMI, FMT_REV.1/JCRMI, and FMT_SMR.1/JCRMI) are not
                       included in the ST. In the PP [6] the use of the Java Card RMI is optional.
                       The SFR FDP_ITC.2/INSTALLER from the PP [6] is replaced by FDP_ITC.2[CCM] which
                       enforces the Security Domain access control policy and the Secure Channel Protocol
                       information flow policy and which are more restrictive than the PACKAGE LOADING
                       information flow control SFP from PP [6].

                      The set of SFRs that define the card content management mechanism CarG are partly
                      replaced or refined and are considered to be equivalent or more restrictive because of
                      the newly introduced SFPs:
                      1. Security Domain access control policy,
                      2. Secure Channel Protocol information flow policy
                      provide a concrete and more restrictive implementation of the PACKAGE LOADING
                      information flow control SFP from PP [6].

                 7.5.1 Rationale for Exclusion of Dependencies
                       The dependency FIA_UID.1 of FMT_SMR.1[INSTALLER] is unsupported. This ST
                       does not require the identification of the "Installer" since it can be considered as part of
                       the TSF.
                       The dependency FIA_UID.1 of FMT_SMR.1[ADEL] is unsupported. This ST does not
                       require the identification of the "applet deletion manager" since it can be considered as
                       part of the TSF.
                       The dependency FIA_UID.1 of FMT_SMR.1[MODULAR-DESIGN] is unsupported.
                       This ST does not require the identification of the "Module Invoker" since it can be
                       considered as part of the TSF.
                       The dependency FMT_SMF.1 of FMT_MSA.1[JCRE] is unsupported. The
                       dependency between FMT_MSA.1[JCRE] and FMT_SMF.1 is not satisfied because no
                       management functions are required for the Java Card RE.
                       The dependency FAU_SAA.1 of FAU_ARP.1 is unsupported. The dependency of
                       FAU_ARP.1 on FAU_SAA.1 assumes that a "potential security violation" generates
                       an audit event. On the contrary, the events listed in FAU_ARP.1 are self-contained
                       (arithmetic exception, ill-formed bytecodes, access failure) and ask for a straightforward
                       reaction of the TSFs on their occurrence at runtime. The JCVM or other components
                       of the TOE detect these events during their usual working order. Thus, there is no
                       mandatory audit recording in this ST.
                       The dependency FIA_UAU.1 of FIA_AFL.1[PIN] is unsupported. The TOE
                       implements the firewall access control SFP, based on which access to the object
                       Implementing FIA_AFL.1[PIN] is organized.
                       The dependencies FMT_SMR.1 of FMT_MSA.1[SecureBox] and
                       FMT_MSA.3[SecureBox] are unsupported. Only S.JCRE is allowed to modify security
                       attributes for the Secure Box before S.SBNativeCode is executed. Furthermore the TOE
                       does not allow to specify alternative initial values for the security attributes of the Secure
                       Box.

                      The selection of assurance components is based on the underlying PP [6]. The Security
                      Target uses the augmentations from the PP, chooses EAL6 and adds the components
                      ASE_TSS.2 and ALC_FLR.1.
                      The rationale for the augmentations is the same as in the PP.
                      The assurance level EAL6 is an elaborated pre-defined level of the CC, Part 3 [3]. The
                      assurance components in an EAL level are chosen in a way that they build a mutually
                      supportive and complete set of components.
                      The additional requirements chosen for augmentation do not add any dependencies,
                      which are not already fulfilled for the corresponding requirements contained in EAL6.
                      Therefore, the components ASE_TSS.2 and ALC_FLR.1 add additional assurance to
                      EAL6, but the mutual support of the requirements is still guaranteed.

                  8.1 Introduction
                       The Security Functions (SF) introduced in this section realize the SFRs of the TOE.
                       See Table 18 "Overview of Security Functions" for list of all Security Functions. Each
                       SF consists of components spread over several TOE components to provide a security
                       functionality and fulfill SFRs.

                       security attributes are initialized and assigned by the system itself which fulfills
                       FMT_MSA.2[FIREWALL-JCVM], FMT_MSA.3[FIREWALL] , and FMT_MSA.3[JCVM].
                       SF.JCVM ensures together with SF.PERS_MEM that the system is halted in case
                       non existing Java objects could be referenced after an aborted transaction to fulfill
                       FDP_RIP.1[ABORT].

                 8.2.2 SF.CONFIG: Configuration Management
                       SF.CONFIG provides means to store Initialization Data and Pre-personalization Data
                       before TOE delivery FAU_SAS.1[SCP].
                       SF.CONFIG provides means to change configuration items of the card. Some
                       configuration items can be changed by the customer and some can only be changed
                       by NXP (FDP_IFC.2[CFG], FDP_IFF.1[CFG] , FMT_MSA.3[CFG], FMT_MSA.1[CFG],
                       FMT_SMR.1[CFG], FMT_SMF.1[CFG], FIA_UID.1[CFG]). SF.CONFIG supports
                       FCS_COP.1 by configuring the behavior of cryptographic operations.

                 8.2.3 SF.OPEN: Card Content Management
                       SF.OPEN provides the card content management functionality according the
                       GlobalPlatform Specification [17]. This supports FCO_NRO.2[SC], FDP_ACC.1[SD],
                       FDP_ACF.1[SD], FDP_UIT.1[CCM], FDP_IFC.2[SC], FDP_IFF.1[SC], FDP_IFC.2[SC],
                       FIA_UID.1[SC], FIA_UID.2[AID], FIA_USB.1[AID], FMT_MSA.1[SC], FMT_MSA.1[SD],
                       FMT_MSA.3[SC], FMT_MSA.3[SD], FMT_SMF.1[ADEL] , FMT_SMR.1[SD],
                       FMT_SMF.1[SC], FMT_SMF.1[SD], FTP_ITC.1[SC], FMT_MSA.3[ADEL],
                       FMT_SMR.1[INSTALLER], FMT_SMR.1[ADEL], FDP_ITC.2[CCM], FDP_ROL.1[CCM],
                       FIA_UAU.1[SC], FIA_UAU.4[SC], and FTP_ITC.1[SC]. In addition to the GP
                       specification, the Java Card Runtime Environment specification [16] is followed to
                       support FDP_ACC.2[ADEL], FDP_ACF.1[ADEL], FMT_MSA.3[SC], FMT_MSA.3[SD],
                       FMT_MTD.1[JCRE], FMT_MTD.3[JCRE], FPT_FLS.1[INSTALLER], FDP_RIP.1[bArray],
                       FDP_RIP.1[ADEL], FPT_TDC.1, FPT_FLS.1[ADEL], and FPT_FLS.1[CCM] for
                       application loading, installation, and deletion.
                       AID management is provided by SF.OPEN according to the GlobalPlatform Specification
                       [17], the Java Card Runtime Environment Specification [16], and the Java Card API
                       Specification [14] to support FIA_ATD.1[AID].
                       SF.OPEN is part of the TOE runtime environment and thus separated from other
                       applications to fulfill FMT_MSA.1[ADEL]. It supports FAU_ARP.1 and FPT_FLS.1 by
                       responding with error messages according to the GlobalPlatform mapping guidelines
                       [20] and fulfills FPT_RCV.3[INSTALLER] by inherent memory cleanup in case of aborted
                       loading and installation.

                 8.2.4 SF.CRYPTO: Cryptographic Functionality
                       SF.CRYPTO provides key creation, key management, key deletion and cryptographic
                       functionality. It provides the API in accordance to the Java Card API Specification
                       [14] to fulfill FCS_CKM.1, FCS_CKM.2, FCS_CKM.3, FCS_CKMcess.
