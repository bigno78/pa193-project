                              1.3 TOE Overview


                           1.3.1 Introduction
                                    The Hardware Security Target [13] contains, in section 1.3 “TOE Overview”, an
                                    introduction about the N7021 hardware TOE that is considered in the evaluation. The
                                    Hardware Security Target includes IC Dedicated Software provided with the N7021
                                    hardware platform.
                                    The “Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA“ is a cryptographic library that can be used by
                                    the Security IC Embedded Software. The cryptographic library consists of several binary
                                    packages that are intended to be linked to the Security IC Embedded Software. The
                                    Security IC Embedded Software developer links the binary packages that he needs to his
                                    Embedded Software and the whole is subsequently implemented in arbitrary memory of
                                    the hardware platform.
                                    The NXP N7021 provides the computing platform and cryptographic support by means of
                                    co-processors for the Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA.
                                    The Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA provides the security functionality described
                                    below in addition to the functionality described in the Hardware Security Target [13] for
                                    the hardware platform:
                                    The Crypto Library provides RSA, RSA key generation, RSA public key computation,
                                    ECDSA (ECC over GF(p)) signature generation and verification, ECDSA (ECC over
                                    GF(p)) key generation, ECDH (ECC Diffie-Hellmann) key-exchange, standard security
                                    level SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512.

                           1.3.2 Life-Cycle
                                    The life cycle of the hardware platform as part of the TOE is described in section 1.4.4
                                    "Security During Development and Production" of the Hardware Security Target [13]. The
                                    delivery process or the hardware platform is independent from the Crypto Library Cobalt
                                    on N7021 VA.
                                    The Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA is delivered in Phase 1 (for a definition of the
                                    Phases refer to Section 1.2.3 'TOE life cycle’ of the Protection Profile [5]) as a software
                                    package (a set of binary files) to the developers of Security IC Embedded Software. The
                                    Security IC Embedded Software may comprise in this case an operating system and/or
                                    other smart card software (applications). The Software developer can incorporate the
                                    Crypto Library into their product.
                                    The subsequent use of the Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA by Security IC Embedded
                                    Software Developers is out of the control of the developer NXP Semiconductors; the
                                    integration of the Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA into Security IC Embedded
                                    Software is not part of this evaluation.
                                    Security during Development and Production
                                    The development process of the Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA is part of the
                                    evaluation. The access to the implementation documentation, test bench and the source
                                    code is restricted to the development team of the Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA.
                                    The security measures installed within NXP, including a secure delivery process, ensure
                                    the integrity and quality of the delivered Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA binary files.

                           1.3.3 Specific Issues of Hardware and the Common Criteria
                                    Regarding the Application Note 2 of the Protection Profile [5] the TOE provides additional
                                    functionality which is not covered in the Protection profile [5] and the Hardware Security
                                    Target [13]. This additional functionality is added using the policy “P.Add-CryptoLib-
                                    Func” (see Section 3.3 of this Security Target).

                              1.4 TOE Description
                                    The Target of Evaluation (TOE) consists of a hardware part and a software part:
                                    • The hardware part consists of the N7021 with IC Dedicated Software. The hardware
                                      part of the TOE includes dedicated guidance documentation.

                           1.4.1 Hardware Description
                                    The NXP N7021 hardware is described in section 1.4.3.1 “Hardware Description” of the
                                    Hardware Security Target [13]. The IC Dedicated Software delivered with the hardware
                                    platform is described in section 1.4.3.2 “Software Description” of the Hardware Security
                                    Target [13].
                                    As described in the Hardware Security Target [13], the N7021 hardware provides the
                                    customer with a configuration option to disable the PKCC coprocessor. When the PKCC
                                    is disabled using this option, it is no longer possible to make use of the packages 'RSA
                                    Encryption / Decryption', 'RSA Key Generation' and 'ECC over GF(p)' provided by this

                                    • The RSA algorithm can be used for encryption and decryption as well as for signature
                                      generation, signature verification, message encoding and signature encoding.
                                    • The RSA key generation can be used to generate RSA key pairs.
                                    • The RSA public key computation can be used to compute the public key that belongs to
                                      a given private CRT key.
                                    The TOE supports various key sizes for RSA up to a limit of 4096 bits.
                                    RSA functionality is not available in case the customer disabled the PKCC coprocessor
                                    as part of the hardware configuration. See the Hardware Security Target [13] for more
                                    information.
                                    ECDSA (ECC over GF(p))
                                    • The ECDSA (ECC over GF(p)) algorithm can be used for signature generation and
                                      signature verification.
                                    • The ECDSA (ECC over GF(p)) key generation algorithm can be used to generate ECC
                                      over GF(p) key pairs for ECDSA.
                                    • The ECDH (ECC Diffie-Hellman) key exchange algorithm can be used to establish
                                      cryptographic keys. It can be also used as secure point multiplication.
                                    The TOE supports various key sizes for ECC over GF(p) up to a limit of 640 bits for
                                    signature generation, key pair generation and key exchange. For signature verification
                                    the TOE supports key sizes up to a limit of 640 bits.

                                    information.
                                    SHA
                                    • The SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 algorithms can be used for

                                      creation or key derivation.
                                    Resistance of cryptographic algorithms against attacks
                                    The cryptographic algorithms are designed taking into account the attacks described in
                                    JIL-ATT-SC: Attack Methods for Smartcards and Similar Devices [19].
                                    Further security functionality
                                    • The TOE includes internal security measures for residual information protection.
                                    Note that the TOE does not restrict access to the functions provided by the hardware:
                                    these functions are still directly accessible to the Security IC Embedded Software.


                                      1 These crypto functions are supplied as a library rather than as a monolithic program, and hence a user of
                                          the library may include only those functions that are actually required – it is not necessary to include all
                                          cryptographic functions of the library in every Security IC Embedded Software. For example, it is possible
                                          to omit the RSA or the ECC components. However, some dependencies exist; details are described in
                                          the User Guidance [6].

                           1.4.5 Life Cycle and Delivery of the TOE
                                    The life cycle and delivery for the NXP N7021 hardware is described in section 1.4.4
                                    “Security during development and production” of the Hardware Security Target [13].
                                    The Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA is delivered as part of Phase 1 (for a definition
                                    of the Phases refer to section ‘1.2.3 TOE life cycle’ of the Protection Profile [5]) to the
                                    Security IC Embedded Software developer. The Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA
                                    may be delivered by e-mail or by Document Control (DocuControl or DocStore) or by
                                    delivering physical media such as compact disks by mail or courier. To protect the Crypto
                                    Library Cobalt on N7021 VA during the delivery process, the Crypto Library Cobalt
                                    on N7021 VA is encrypted and digitally signed. The Security IC Embedded Software
                                    developer then integrates the Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA in the Security IC
                                    Embedded Software.

                           1.4.6 TOE Intended Usage
                                    Regarding to Phase 7 (for a definition of the Phases refer to section ‘1.2.3 TOE life
                                    cycle’ of the Protection Profile [5]), the combination of the hardware and the Security
                                    IC Embedded Software is used by the end-user. The method of use of the product in
                                    this phase depends on the application. The TOE is intended to be used in an unsecured
                                    environment, that is, the TOE does not rely on the Phase 7 environment to counter any
                                    threat.
                                    For details on the usage of the hardware platform refer to section 1.4.5 “TOE Intended
                                    Usage” in the Hardware Security Target [13].

2         CC Conformance and Evaluation Assurance Level
                                    The evaluation is based upon:
                                    • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 1: Introduction
                                      and general model, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April 2017, CCMB-2017-04-001" [1]
                                    • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 2: Security
                                      functional components, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April 2017, CCMB-2017-04-002" [2]
                                    • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 3: Security
                                      assurance components, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April 2017, CCMB-2017-04-003" [3]
                                    For the evaluation the following methodology will be used:
                                    • "Common Methodology for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Evaluation
                                      Methodology, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April 2017, CCMB-2017-04-004" [4]
                                    The chosen level of assurance is EAL6 + augmented.
                                    The augmentations to EAL6 are ASE_TSS.2 and ALC_FLR.1.
                                    This Security Target claims the following CC conformances:
                                    • CC 3.1 Part 2 extended, Part 3 conformant, EAL6 augmented
                                    • Strict Conformance to the Protection Profile [5]
                                    The assurance level for evaluation and the functionality of the TOE are chosen in order to
                                    allow the confirmation that the TOE is suitable for use within devices compliant with the
                                    German Digital Signature Law.
                                    Note 1. The hardware platform is evaluated according to the assurance level EAL 6
                                    augmented. The evaluation of the hardware platform is appropriate for the composite
                                    evaluation since both the EAL level and the augmentations claimed in this Security
                                    Target are identical to those claimed for the hardware platform (refer to the Hardware
                                    Security Target [13]).

                              2.1 Conformance claim rationale
                                    According to chapter 2 this Security Target claims strict conformance to the Protection
                                    Profile [5]. As shown in 1.3 the composed TOE consists of hardware (Secure Controller
                                    IC) and software (IC Dedicated Software). This is identical to the TOE as defined in [5]
                                    and therefore the TOE type is consistent.

3         Security Problem Definition

                              3.1 Description of Assets
                                    Since this Security Target claims strict conformance to a PP [5], the assets defined in
                                    section 3.1 of the Protection Profile apply to this Security Target. User Data and TSF
                                    data are defined as part of assets in [13]. Since the data computed by the Crypto Library
                                    contains keys, plain text and cipher text that are considered as User Data and e.g.
                                    blinding vectors that are considered as TSF data the assets are considered as complete
                                    for this Security Target.

                              3.2 Threats
                                    Since this Security Target claims strict conformance to the PP [5], the threats defined in
                                    section 3.2 of the Protection Profile, and which are described in section 3.2 “Threats” of
                                    the Hardware Security Target [13] are valid for this Security Target. No additional threats
                                    are defined for this Security Target.

                              3.3 Organizational Security Policies

                                    the Crypto Library for use by the Security IC Embedded Software:
                                    P.Add-CryptoLib-Func: Additional Specific Security Functionality
                                    The TOE provides the following additional security functionality to the Security IC
                                    Embedded Software:
                                    • RSA encryption, decryption, signature generation, signature verification, message
                                      encoding and signature encoding.
                                    • RSA public key computation
                                    • RSA key generation,
                                    • ECDSA (ECC over GF(p)) signature generation and verification,
                                    • ECC over GF(p) key generation,
                                    • ECDH (ECC Diffie-Hellman) key exchange,

                                    In addition, the TOE shall provide resistance against attacks as described in Note 4 and
                                    in Security architectural information.
                                    Regarding the Application Note 5 of the Protection Profile [5] there are no other additional
                                    policies defined in this Security Target.

                              3.4 Assumptions
                                    The assumptions are described in the Hardware Security Target [13]. No additional
                                    assumptions are defined for this Security Target.

                              4.1 Security Objectives for the TOE
                                    The security objectives for the TOE defined in the Protection Profile [5] and the Hardware
                                    Security Target [13] are entirely applied to this Security Target.
                                    The following additional security objectives for the Crypto Library are defined by this ST,
                                    and are provided by the software part of the TOE:

                                    and Similar Devices [19], which include Side Channel Attacks, Perturbation attacks,
                                    Differential Fault Analysis (DFA) and timing attacks. The following exceptions apply:
                                    1. RSA Public Key computation and RSA Key generation do not contain protective
                                       measures against DPA
                                    2. ECDSA (ECC over GF(p)) Key Generation does not contain protective measures
                                       against DPA
                                    3. SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 do not contain protective
                                       measures against DPA, DFA and timing attacks. It provides countermeasures against
                                       template attacks targeting the input message and the output digest.
                                    This does not mean that the algorithm is insecure; rather at the time of this security
                                    target no promising attacks were found. More details about conditions and restrictions for
                                    resistance against attacks are given in the user documentation of the Crypto Library.

                              4.2 Security Objectives for the IC Embedded Software
                                    The security objectives for the Security IC Embedded Software defined in section 4.2 of
                                    the Protection Profile [5] and additional refinements in the Hardware Security Target [13]
                                    entirely apply to this Security Target.
                                    The TOE assumes that the Security IC Embedded Software abides by the provisions
                                    detailed in “Clarification of Treatment of user data of the Composite TOE (OE.Resp-
                                    Appl)” contained within section 4.2 “Security Objectives for the Security IC Embedded
                                    Software” of the Hardware Security Target [13].

                              4.3 Security Objectives for the Operational Environment
                                    The security objective for the “Security Objectives for the Operational environment”
                                    defined in the PP [5], and given in the Hardware Security Target [13] are entirely valid for
                                    this Security Target.

                              4.4 Security Objectives Rationale
                                    Section 4.4 of the Protection Profile [5] and Section 4.4 of the Hardware Security Target
                                    [13] provide a rationale how the threats, organisational security policies and assumptions
                                    are addressed by the objectives that are subject of the PP. They entirely apply to this
                                    Security Target. The justification for the additional security objectives for the Crypto
                                    Library on N7021 are listed in the table below:

                                                                                          O.RSA_PubExp
                                                                                          O.RSA_KeyGen
                                                                                          O.ECDSA
                                                                                          O.ECC_DHKE
                                                                                          O.ECC_KeyGen
                                                                                          O.SHA

                                    They are in line with the security objectives of the Protection Profile and supplement
                                    these according to the additional assumptions and organisational security policy.
                                    The rationale for all item defined in the Security Target is given below.
                                    Since the objectives O.RSA, O.RSA_PubExp, O.RSA_KeyGen, O.ECDSA,
                                    O.ECC_DHKE, O.ECC_KeyGen and O.SHA require the TOE to implement exactly
                                    the same specific security functionality as required by P.Add-CryptoLib-Func, the
                                    organizational security policy P.Add-CryptoLib-Func is covered by the security objectives.
                                    Additionally, the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing, O.Malfunction,
                                    O.Phys-Manipulation and O.Leak-Forced define how to implement the specific security
                                    functionality required by P.Add-CryptoLib-Func and therefore support P.Add-CryptoLib-
                                    Func. These security objectives are also valid for the additional specific security
                                    functionality since they must also avert the related threats for the components added to
                                    the organisational security policy.
                                    The justification of the additional policy and the additional assumptions show that they
                                    do not contradict with the rationale already given in the Protection Profile [5] for the
                                    assumptions, policy and threats defined there.

                                    To support a better understanding of the combination Protection Profile and Security
                                    Target of the hardware platform (N7021) vs. this Security Target (Crypto Library Cobalt
                                    on N7021 VA), the TOE SFRs are presented in the following sections.

                           6.1.1 SFRs from the Protection Profile and the Security Target of the platform
                                    The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) for this TOE (Crypto Library Cobalt on
                                    N7021 VA) are specified based on the Smart Card IC Platform Protection Profile [5], and
                                    are defined in the Common Criteria [2] or in the Protection Profile [5]. They entirely apply
                                    to this Security Target.
                                    Note 5. These requirements have already been stated in the Hardware Security Target
                                    [13] and are fulfilled by the chip hardware, if not indicated otherwise in this Section.
                                    The additional SFRs shown in this Section are defined in the Common Criteria, described
                                    in sections 6.1.3 “Security Functional Requirements added in this Security Target” of the
                                    Hardware Security Target [13]. They entirely apply to this Security Target.

                           6.1.2 Security Functional Requirements added in this Security Target
                                    The SFRs in Section 6.1.1 are further supplemented by the additional SFRs described in
                                    the following subsections of this Security Target.
                                    The SFRs described in Table 3 are added for the Crypto Library. The composite TOE,
                                    consisting of chip hardware N7021 and Crypto Library, fulfils all requirements from
                                    Section 6.1.1 and Table 3.

                                    Security Assurance Requirement ADV_SPM.1 requires the developer to provide a
                                    Security Policy Model for the Crypto Library. However, the N7021 hardware already
                                    provides a Security Policy Model (see [13] for details), which also applies unchanged
                                    to the composite product. As the SFRs introduced in this ST do not add a new Security
                                    Policy or change the rules of existing Security Policies of the hardware, there is no need
                                    for an additional Security Policy Model for the Crypto Library.

                           6.2.1 Refinements of the Security Assurance Requirements for EAL6+
                                    The Security Target claims strict conformance to the Protection Profile [5], and therefore
                                    it has to be conform to the refinements of the TOE security assurance requirements (see
                                    Application Note 23 of the PP [5]).
                                    The Hardware Security Target [13] for N7021 has chosen the evaluation assurance
                                    level EAL6+. The Security Target of the hardware platform with IC Dedicated Software
                                    including cryptographic library is based on the Protection Profile [5], which requires
                                    the lower level EAL4+. This implies that the refinements made in the Protection Profile
                                    [5], section 6.2.1 Refinements of the TOE Assurance Requirements, for EAL4+ had to
                                    be refined again in order to ensure EAL6+ in the Hardware Security Target (this was
                                    necessary for ALC_CMS.5, ALC_CMC.5, ADV_IMP.2, ATE_COV.3, and ADV_FSP.5).
                                    Since these refinements explain and interpret the CC for hardware, these refinements do
                                    not affect the additional software in this composite TOE. Therefore all refinements made
                                    in the PP [5] are valid without change for the composite TOE.

                              6.3 Security Requirements Rationale


                           6.3.1    Rationale for the Security Functional Requirements
                                    Section 6.3.1 of the PP [5] and Section 6.3.1 of the Hardware Security Target [13]
                                    provide the mapping between security functional requirements and security objectives of
                                    the TOE. This mapping entirely apply to this Security Target.
                                    This ST lists a number of security objectives and SFRs for Crypto Library, which are
                                    additional to both the PP and the Hardware ST. These are listed in the following table.

                                    • Each objective is directly implemented by a single SFR specifying the (cryptographic)
                                      service that the objective wishes to achieve (see the above table for the mapping).
                                    • The requirements and architectural measures that originally were taken from the
                                      Protection Profile [5] and thus were also part of the Security Target of the hardware
                                      (chip) evaluation support the security objectives:
                                      – FRU_FLT.2 and FPT_FLS.1 supports the objective by ensuring that the TOE works
                                        correctly (i.e., all of the TOE’s capabilities are ensured) within the specified operating
                                        conditions and maintains a secure state when the TOE is outside the specified

                                       are detected.

                                       User Data (plain text data, keys) or TSF Data is disclosed when they are transmitted
                                       between different functional units of the TOE (i.e., the different memories, the CPU,

                                       data secret.
                                     – FDP_IFC.1 also supports the aspects of confidentiality by ensuring that User
                                       Data and TSF Data are not accessible from the TOE except when the Security IC
                                       Embedded Software decides to communicate them via an external interface.
                                     – FDP_RIP.1[SW] and FCS_CKM.4 ensures that the TOE provides procedural
                                       measures to prevent disclosure of memory contents that was used by the TOE. The
                                       Crypto Library supports FDP_RIP.1[SW] and FCS_CKM.4 by making all memory
                                       contents used by the library no longer available. Note that the requirement for
                                       residual information protection applies to all functionality of the Crypto Library.

                           6.3.2 Extended requirements
                                    This Security Target does not define extended requirements.

                           6.3.3 Dependencies of security requirements
                                    SFRs [FDP_ITC.1, or FDP_ITC.2 or FCS_CKM.1] are not included in this Security Target
                                    for FCS_COP.1/SHA since the TOE only provides a pure engine for these algorithms
                                    without additional features like the handling of keys or importing data from outside the
                                    TOE. Therefore the Security IC Embedded Software must fulfil these requirements
                                    related to the needs of the realized application.

                           6.3.4 Rationale for the Assurance Requirements
                                    The selection of assurance components and augmentations of Crypto Library on N7021
                                    is generally based on EAL6, the underlying Protection Profile [5], and the Security Target
                                    of the hardware [13] of the N7021.
                                    EAL6 was chosen to provide an even stronger baseline of assurance than the EAL4 in
                                    the Protection Profile. The augmentations ALC_FLR.1 and ASE_TSS.2 were chosen to
                                    extend the level of assurance even further.

7         TOE Summary Specification
                                    This chapter describes the “IT Security Functionality”.

                              7.1 IT Security Functionality
                                    The evaluation of this cryptographic library is performed as a composite evaluation,
                                    where the TOE comprises both the underlying hardware and the embedded software
                                    (Crypto Library). The TOE of this composite evaluation therefore extends the security
                                    functionality already available in the chip platform (see section 7.1 “Portions of the TOE
                                    Security Functionality” of the Hardware Security [13]).
                                    The security functionality of N7021
                                    The security functionality of the hardware platform for the N7021 is described in the
                                    Hardware Security Target [13]. They entirely apply to this Security Target.
                                    Note 8. The security functionality SF.LOG is extended by the Crypto Library as described
                                    in Security Features of the TOE.


                                    The additional security functionality provided by the TOE is described in the following
                                    sub-sections.
                                    The IT security functionalities directly correspond to the TOE security functional
                                    requirements defined in Section 6.1. The definitions of the IT security functionalities refer
                                    to the corresponding security functional requirements.

                           7.1.1 Security Services of the TOE

                         7.1.1.1    SS.RSA

                                    The TOE provides functions that implement the RSA algorithm and the RSA-CRT
                                    algorithm for data encryption, decryption, signature and verification. All algorithms are
                                    defined in PKCS #1, v2.2 (RSAEP, RSADP, RSAP1, RSAVP1)
                                    This routine supports various key lengths from 512 bits to 4096 bits.
                                    The TOE contains modular exponentiation functions, which, together with other functions
                                    in the TOE, perform the operations required for RSA encryption or decryption. Two
                                    different RSA algorithms are supported by the TOE, namely the "Simple Straight Forward
                                    Method" (called RSA "straight forward", the key consists of the pair n and d) and RSA
                                    using the "Chinese Remainder Theorem" (RSA CRT, the key consists of the quintuple p,
                                    q, dp, dq, qInv).
                                    Attack resistance for this security functionality is discussed in Security architectural
                                    information.
                                    This security functionality covers:
                                    • FCS_COP.1/RSA

                         7.1.1.2    SS.RSA_Pad

                                    The TOE provides functions that implement the RSA algorithm and the RSA-CRT
                                    algorithm for message and signature encoding. This IT security functionality supports the
                                    EME-OAEP and EMSA-PSS signature scheme. All algorithms are defined in PKCS #1,
                                    v2.2 (EME-OAEP, EMSA-PSS)

6.1.5                  Memory access control
Usage of multiple applications in one Smartcard often requires code and data separation in order to prevent
that one application can access code and/or data of another application. For this reason the TOE provides Area
based Memory Access Control. The underlying Memory Protection Unit (MPU) is documented in Appendix B3.5
of the ARMv7 M architecture reference manual [ARMv7M].
In particular, the MPU provides full support for:
 Protection regions.
 Overlapping protection regions, with ascending region priority:
  − Region 7 = highest priority.
  − Region 0 = lowest priority.
 Access permissions.
   MPU mismatches and permission violations invoke the programmable-priority MemManage fault handler.

The MPU can be used to:
   Enforce privilege rules, preventing user applications from corrupting operating system data.
   Separate processes, blocking the active task from accessing other tasks’ data.
   Enforce access rules, allowing memory regions to be defined as read-only or detecting unexpected memory
    accesses.

The SFRs are provided by the Memory Access Control Policy (FDP_ACC.1 and dependencies).


6.1.5.1                Subjects, objects and operations of the Memory Access Control Policy
Subjects:
 MPU

Objects:
 memory/code addresses

Operations:
 Read a/o write a/o execute access


6.1.5.2                Security attributes of the Memory Access Control Policy
Security Attribute which define the roles for Subject MPU:
 Npriv flag defining privilege/non-privilege mode


Security Attribute which control the behavior of the Subject MPU:

Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)

 MPU enable/disable bit.
 8 regions with the following attributes
    − a unique priority
    − the enable bit
    − the xn (execute never) bit
    − the start address and size
    − an access matrix which defines if an Operation of the MPU (Subject) to a memory/code address (Object)
     lying in the region is allowed or denied
 A bit defining the acces behavior of the default region, i.e. memory/code addresses not covered by one of the
  8 MPU regions.


Security Attributes for objects:
There are no security attributes for objects.


6.1.5.3            Access control rules of the Memory Access Control Policy
The following generic rules shall apply in case the MPU is enabled. In case the MPU is disabled, a privileged and
unprivileged code has full read/write/execute rights to all addresses.
 If an address is contained in multiple enabled regions, then the region with the highest priority defines the
    access rights.
   If an address is contained in no region then the default region defines the access rights.
   The region defining the access rights checks if the Subject has access to the Object with respect to the desired
    Operation. In case the access is denied the MPU throws an access violation exception. The checks are done
    according to the access matrix inTable 21.
   overlapping regions, have access to other regions with ascending region priority:
    region 7 = highest priority, region 0 = lowest priority
   execution of code is bound to the read access of Table 21 and the xn bit. If the xn bit is cleared and read
    access is enabled then execution of code is defined by Table 21. If the xn bit is set then execution is never
    allowed.

The TOE provides a Flash Loader to download user data into the SOLID FLASHҹ NVM, either during production
of the TOE or at customer site. Depending on the configuration option EA the Flash Loader claims different sets
of SFRs. [PP0084] section 7.3.1 “Package 1: Loader dedicated for usage in secured environment only” is claimed
for both options. [PP0084] section 7.2 Package “Authentication of the Security IC” and [PP0084] section 7.3.2
“Package 2: Loader dedicated for usage by authorized users only” is only claimed in case TOE is ordered with
EA unavailable, however a subset of SFRs from loader package 2 is also claimed, if TOE is ordered with EA
available.

Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)

6.2.1.1              Implementation representation (ADV_IMP)
The refinement of [PP0084] requires the evaluator to check for completeness. In case of ADV_IMP.2 the entire
implementation representation has to be provided anyhow. A check for completeness is also applicable in case
the entire implementation representation is provided.

6.2.1.2              Life cycle support (ALC_CMS)
The refinement from [PP0084] can also be applied to the assurance level EAL 6 augmented with ALC_CMS.5.
The assurance package ALC_CMS.4 is extended to ALC_CMS.5 with aspects regarding the configuration control
system for the TOE. The refinement is still valid.

6.2.1.3              Configuration management capabilities (ALC_CMC)
The refinement from [PP0084] details, how configuration management has to be also applied to production.
This is also applicable for ALC_CMC.5. ALC_CMC.5 is not specifically focused on production.

6.2.1.4              Test Coverage (ATE_COV)
The refinement in [PP0084] clarifies, how to deal with testing of security mechanisms for physical protection. It
further requests the TOE to be tested under different operating conditions. These refinements are also
applicable for ATE_COV.3, which requires complete TSFI coverage.

6.2.1.5              Functional Specification (ADV_FSP)
The refinement from [PP0084] can also be applied to the assurance level EAL 6 augmented with ADV_FSP.5. The
assurance package ADV_FSP.4 is extended to ADV_FSP.5 with aspects regarding the level of description.
ADV_FSP.5 requires a semi-formal description in addition. The refinement is still valid.
For refinement details see [PP0084].

6.2.2                Security policy model details
EAL6 requires the development of a formal security policy model of the TSF, and establishing a correspondence
between the functional specification and this security policy model. Preserving internal consistency the
security policy model is expected to formally establish the security principles from its characteristics by means
of a mathematical proof.

The table above gives an overview how the security functional requirements are combined to meet the security
objectives. This table has to be read in addition to [PP0084] table 2 “Security Requirements versus Security
Objectives”. The detailed justification is given in the following:
The security functional component Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2) has been newly created (Common
Criteria Part 2 extended). This component allows that particular parts of the security mechanisms and
functions provided by the TOE can be tested after TOE Delivery. This security functional component is used
instead of the functional component FPT_TST.1 from Common Criteria Part 2. For the user it is important to
know which security functions or mechanisms can be tested. The functional component FPT_TST.1 does not
mandate to explicitly specify the security functions being tested. In addition, FPT_TST.1 requires verification of
the integrity of TSF data and stored TSF executable code which might violate the security policy.
The security functional requirement FPT_TST.2 detects attempts to conduce a physical manipulation on the
monitoring functions of the TOE. The objective of FPT_TST.2 is O.Phys-Manipulation.
The security functional requirement “Subset access control (FDP_ACC.1)” with the related Security Function
Policy (SFP) “Memory Access Control Policy” exactly require the implementation of an area based memory
access control as required by O.Mem-Access. The related TOE security functional requirements FDP_ACC.1,
FDP_ACF.1, FMT_MSA.3, FMT_MSA.1, FMT_SMF.1 and FMT_SMR.1 cover this security objective. The
implementation of these functional requirements is represented by the dedicated privilege level concept.
The additional SCL related SFRs support standard TDES and AES encryption and decryption. It also offers MAC
services based on these cryptographic primitives.
The additional cryptographic SFRs related to RSA and ECC are mapped to the respective RSA and ECC
objectives.
The additional loader SFRs describe the Flash Loader roles and the access rules. Therefore these additional
SFRs are mapped to O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader contributing to the aspect “access control for usage of the loader
functionality” as described in [PP0084]. In case EA is chosen, FTP_ITC.1 is not part of the TOE and therefore not

mapped to O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader. However due to the confidentiality and integrity protection of downloaded
user data andone-way authentication from user towards Flash Loader, the loader can still be controlled in an
effective way and prevent misuse of unauthorized usage.
The loader SFR FTP_ITC.1, FDP_ACC.1/Loader and FDP_ACF.1/Loader describe the requirement of a trusted
channel with role based access control in order to use the loader functionality. This prevents loading of
unauthorized software by unauthorized subjects and maps to O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality. In case EA is chosen,
the Flash Loader requests a one-way authentication instead of a mutual authentication. FTP_ITC.1 is not part
of the TOE. However the objective is still met, because the one-way authentication and role based access
control together with the environmental objective OE.Prevent_Masquerade prevent unauthorized and
manipulative usage.
The justification of the security objective and the additional requirements show that they do not contradict the
rationale already given in [PP0084] for the assumptions, policy and threats defined there.
Nevertheless, the developer of the Smartcard Embedded Software must ensure that the additional functions
are used as specified and that the User Data processed by these functions are protected as defined for the
application context. The TOE only provides the tool to implement the policy defined in the context of the
application.

6.3.1.1            Dependencies of Security Functional Requirements
The dependencies of security functional requirements are defined and described in [PP0084] section 6.3.2,
7.2.3, 7.3.1, 7.3.2, 7.4.1 and section 7.4.2 for the following security functional requirements: FDP_SDC.1,

Comment 1:
As the privileged mode and the non-privileged mode identified in FMT_SMR.1 are implicitly identified by the
MPU, the dependency to FIA_UID.1 is not applicable.
End of comment.
Comment 2:
The security functional requirement “Cryptographic operation (FCS_COP.1)” met by the TOE has the following
dependencies:
    [FDP_ITC.1 Import of user data without security attributes, or
    FDP_ITC.2 Import of user data with security attributes or
    FCS_CKM.1 Cryptographic key generation]
    FCS_CKM.4 Cryptographic key destruction.
These requirements all address the appropriate management of cryptographic keys used by the specified
cryptographic function. Most requirements concerning key management shall be fulfilled by the environment
since the Smartcard Embedded Software is designed for a specific application context and uses the
cryptographic functions provided by the TOE.
For the security functional requirement FCS_COP.1/SCP/<iteration> and FCS_COP.1/SCL/<iteration> the
respective dependency [FCS_CKM.1 or FDP_ITC.1 or FDP_ITC.2] has to be fulfilled by the environment.
For the security functional requirement FCS_COP.1/RSA/<iteration>, FCS_COP.1/ECC/<iteration> key
generation is also supported by the ACL, therefore the dependency [FCS_CKM.1 or FDP_ITC.1 or FDP_ITC.2] is
met.




The security functional requirement “Cryptographic key destruction (FCS_CKM.4)” met by the TOE has the
following dependencies:
    [FDP_ITC.1 Import of user data without security attributes, or
    FDP_ITC.2 Import of user data with security attributes or
    FCS_CKM.1 Cryptographic key generation]

Comment 3:
There are no security attributes defined for the loader. Access is purely role based.
End of comment.
Comment 4:
The user data to be downloaded are encrypted and integrity protected with the image provider key. Only an
authentic TOE knows this image provider key and is able to decrypt the encrypted user data. Therefore a
trusted channel is not necessary to keep user data confidential.

6.3.2              Rationale of the Assurance Requirements
The chosen assurance level EAL6 is augmented by ALC_FLR.1 in order to meet the assurance expectations
explained in the following paragraphs. In Table 23 the different assurance levels are shown as well as the
augmentations. The augmentations are in compliance with the Protection Profile.
An assurance level EAL6 with the augmentations ALC_FLR.1is required for this type of TOE since it is intended
to defend against highly sophisticated attacks without protective environment. This evaluation assurance
package was selected to permit a developer to gain maximum assurance from positive security engineering
based on good commercial practices. In order to provide a meaningful level of assurance that the TOE provides
an adequate level of defence against such attacks, the evaluators should have access to all information
regarding the TOE including the TSF internals, the low level design and source code including the testing of the
modular design. Additionally the mandatory technical document [JIL_ATT] shall be taken as a basis for the
vulnerability analysis of the TOE.

TOE Summary Specification (ASE_TSS)


7                  TOE Summary Specification (ASE_TSS)
The product overview is given in Section 1.3.1. The Security Features are described below and the relation to
the security functional requirements is shown.
The TOE is equipped with the following security features to meet the security functional requirements:

Table 26      TOE Security Features
 SF_DPM                               Device Phase Management
 SF_PS                                Protection against Snooping
 SF_PMA                               Protection against Modification Attacks
 SF_PLA                               Protection against Logical Attacks
 SF_CS                                Cryptographic Support

The following description of the security features is a complete representation of the TSF.

7.1                SF_DPM: Device Phase Management
The life cycle of the TOE is split up into several phases. . Different operation modes help to protect the TOE
during each phase of its lifecycle.



7.2                SF_PS: Protection against Snooping
The TOE uses various means to protect from snooping of memories and busses and prevents single stepping.

7.3                SF_PMA: Protection against Modifying Attacks
This TOE implements protection against modifying attacks of memories, alarm lines, sensors and instruction
execution order.

7.4                SF_PLA: Protection against Logical Attacks
Memory access of the TOE is controlled by a Memory Protection Unit (MPU), which implements different
priviledge levels. The MPU decides, whether access to a physical memory location is allowed based on access
rights.

7.5                SF_CS: Cryptographic Support
The TOE is equipped with an asymmetric and a symmetric hardware accelerator and also software modules to
support several symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic operations. It further provides random numbers to
meet FCS_RNG.1.



7.6                Assignment of Security Functional Requirements to TOE’s Security
                   Functionality
The justification and overview of the mapping between security functional requirements (SFR) and the TOE’s
security functionality (SF) is given in the sections above. The results are shown in Table 27. The security
functional requirements are addressed by at least one related security feature.

7.7               Security Requirements are internally consistent
For this chapter [PP0084] section 6.3.4 can be applied completely.
The functional requirement FPT_TST.2 requires further protection to prevent manipulation of test results,
while checking the security functions of the TOE. An attacker could aim to switch off or disturb certain sensors
or filters and prevent the detection of distortion by blocking the correct operation of FPT_TST.2. The security
functional requirements required to meet the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing,
O.Malfunction, O.Phys-Manipulation and O.Leak-Forced also protect the security functional requirement
FPT_TST.2. Therefore, the related security functional requirements support the secure implementation and
operation of FPT_TST.2.
The requirement FPT_TST.2 allows testing of some security mechanisms by the Smartcard Embedded Software
after delivery.
The implemented privilege level concept represents the area based memory access protection enforced by the
MPU. As an attacker could attempt to manipulate the level concept as defined and present in the TOE, the
functional requirement FDP_ACC.1 and the related other requirements have to be protected. The security
functional requirements necessary to meet the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing,
O.Malfunction, O.Phys-Manipulation and O.Leak-Forced also protect the area based memory access control
function implemented according to the security functional requirement described in the security functional
requirement FDP_ACC.1 with reference to the Memory Access Control Policy and details given in FDP_ACF.1.
Therefore, those security functional requirements support the secure implementation and operation of
FDP_ACF.1 with its dependent security functional requirements.
