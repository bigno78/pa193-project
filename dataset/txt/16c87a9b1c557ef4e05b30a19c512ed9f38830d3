Public Security Target
Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)


The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is the Infineon Security Controller with following optional available software
packages:
    The asymmetric cryptographic libraries (ACL) in following alternative versions:
       v2.08.007, v2.07.003 and v2.06.003.
            o All ACL libraries provide RSA1 2048/4096 cryptography.
                The library supports also smaller key lengths, but the certification follows the national regulation
                by the BSI2.
            o All ACL libraries provide elliptic curve cryptography EC3
    the Toolbox library in the versions v2.08.007, v2.07.003 and v2.06.003 provides basic mathematical
       functions for a simplified user interface to the Crypto@2304T. The Toolbox library is not part of the TOE
       Security Functionality (TSF).
    the symmetric cryptographic libraries (SCL) in the improved and enhanced version v2.04.002 and the
       version v2.02.010 provide simplified interfaces and utilize the full services of the SCP to the user
    the hardware support library (HSL) in the versions 01.22.4346 and 02.01.6634 provides a simplified
       interface and utilizes the full services of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM to the user
    the hardware support library (HSL) in the versions 03.11.8339 and 03.12.8812 provide equal to the above
       a simplified interface, utilizes the full services of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM to the user, and enables the
       use of an additional advanced reading respectively writing method
    the CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CIPURSE™ CL and CCL) in the version v02.00.0004 provides the
       user OSPT alliance CIPURSE™ V2 conformant communication functionality between a PICC and a PCD
    the NRG Software. The NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
and with further specific IC dedicated firmware in several alternative versions.

Please note that always the highest version number points to the most recent status of a library coming usually
with improvements and/or additional functionality.

Note that each of the versions of the ACL, SCL, HSL, CCL and the NRG are optional and alternatively. This means
that the TOE comes either with one of the alternative library types– depending on the user choice - or with none.
The library types can freely be combined but not two versions of the equal type. For examples ACL with SCL with
HSL with NRG is welcome but a combination of HSL in version 03.11.8339 and at the same time with HSL in
version 01.22.4346 would not work. The library types are entirely independent from each other.
The security relevant differences in the versions - if any - are detailed in chapter 8. The claims of this Security
Target take the corresponding versions into account and thus the wording in the following refers to the library
type which is cited or else the claim includes always all named versions.

The design step of this TOE is H13.

The Security Target is based on the Protection Profile PP-0084 Security IC Platform Protection Profile with
Augmentation Packages [9] as publicly available for download at https://www.bsi.bund.de and certified under
BSI-CC-PP-0084-2014.
The Security Target is built in compliance with Common Criteria v3.1 Revision 5.

The Security Target takes into account all relevant current final interpretations.

 Rivest-Shamir-Adleman asymmetric cryptographic algorithm

 BSI – Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik – Federal Office for Information Security: Following the national BSI
    recommendations, RSA key lengths below 1976 bits are not included in the certificate. Please note that the BSI expects this key length
    as appropriate until 2022 and recommends for longer usage times key lengths of 3000 bits or higher.
3 The Elliptic Curve Cryptography is abbreviated with EC only in the further, in order to avoid conflicts with the abbreviation for the Error
    Correction Code ECC.

User Guidance Documentation Set
Chapter describes briefly the contents of the individual documents of the User Guidance Documentation,
while the individual documents are versioned and entitled in chapter 9 literature and references. The in this
chapter listed set of user guidance documents belongs to the TOE.

This TOE is represented by a number of various products which are all based on the equal design sources. The
TOE hardware remains entirely equal throughout all derivatives, but the usage for example in form of available
memory sizes, availability of the various interfaces, or other functions varies by means of blocking and chip
configuration. The firmware identifier on board depends on the order.
All TOE derivatives are derived from the equal hardware design results.

The TOE can be identified with the Generic Chip Identification Mode (GCIM). The IFX_CCI_000003h with options
hardware platform is identified by defined bytes of the GCIM as detailed in the HRM [1].
The unique hexadecimal values as stated in the title are:
                         IFX_CCI_000003h
                             IFX_CCI_000005h
                             IFX_CCI_000008h
                             IFX_CCI_00000Ch
                             IFX_CCI_000013h
                             IFX_CCI_000014h
                             IFX_CCI_000015h
                             IFX_CCI_00001Ch
                             IFX_CCI_00001Dh
                             IFX_CCI_000021h
                          IFX_CCI_000022h
The user can easily identify from which production line a certain IC is coming. The corresponding identifier is
given in chapter 2.2.6

These bytes clearly identify the hardware platform, or, in other words, the therein possible values for
IFX_CCI_000003h with options (without prefix IFX_CCI_) represent the equal hardware pIFX_CCI_00002Dh, IFX_CCI_000039h,
IFX_CCI_00003Ah, IFX_CCI_000044h,
IFX_CCI_000045h, IFX_CCI_000046h,
IFX_CCI_000047h, IFX_CCI_000048h,
IFX_CCI_000049h, IFX_CCI_00004Ah,
IFX_CCI_00004Bh, IFX_CCI_00004Ch,

FMT_MTD.1.1/INI_ENA The TSF shall restrict the ability to write the Initialisation Data and Pre-personalisation
                    Data to the Manufacturer.
Application Note: The application note 42 of [PP_BAC] applies. This application note provides a definition, what
is meant by “Pre-personalization Data”. This definition is also applicable to FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA from
[PP_SAC]. Therefore FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be combined.

Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)

6.2.3              Class FPT Protection of the Security Functions
FPT_TST.1               TSF testing
Hierarchical to:        No other components.
Dependencies:           No dependencies.
FPT_TST.1.1             The TSF shall run a suite of self tests during initial start-up, to demonstrate the correct
                        operation of the TSF.
FPT_TST.1.2             The TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to verify the integrity of the
                        TSF data.
FPT_TST.1.3             The TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to verify the integrity of
                        stored TSF executable code.
Application Note: There is no contradiction between application note 46 of [PP_BAC] and application note 52 of
[PP_SAC]. In fact, although the wording is slightly different, the meaning of these application notes is identical.
Therefore either of these application notes applies and FPT_TST.1 from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be
combined.


FPT_PHP.3               Resistance to physical attack
Hierarchical to:        No other components.
Dependencies:           No dependencies.
FPT_PHP.3.1             The TSF shall resist physical manipulation and physical probing to the TSF by
                        responding automatically such that the SFRs are always enforced.
Application Note: Application note 47 of [PP_BAC] and 53 of [PP_SAC] are equivalent. Application note 48 of
[PP_BAC] is only informative to the reader in the sense, that it provides a context to an older CC standard, but
not relevant for the interpretation of FPT_PHP.3. Therefore either application note 47 of [PP_BAC] or
application note 53 of [PP_SAC] applies and FPT_PHP.3 from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be combined.


6.3                SFRs specifically from [PP_SAC]

6.3.1              Class FCS: Cryptographic Support
FCS_CKM.1/DH_PACE Cryptographic key generation – Diffie-Hellman for PACE session keys
Hierarchical to:        No other components.
Dependencies:           [FCS_CKM.2 Cryptographic key distribution or FCS_COP.1 Cryptographic operation]
                        Justification: A Diffie-Hellman key agreement is used in order to have no key
                        distribution, therefore FCS_CKM.2 makes no sense in this case. FCS_CKM.4
                        Cryptographic key destruction: fulfilled by FCS_CKM.4
FCS_CKM.1.1/DH_PACE       The TSF shall generate cryptographic keys in accordance with a specified
                   cryptographic key generation algorithm Diffie-Hellman-Protocol compliant to
                   [PKCS#3], ECDH compliant to [TR_ECC] and specified cryptographic key size Table 6

                      by means of sensors. There are multiple voltage and frequency sensors for the different
                      ISO/IEC 7816 voltage classes and the contactless operation mode. Light sensors are
                      distributed over the chip surface and used to detect light attacks. In addition to the light
                      sensors the EEPROM provides two functions to detect light attacks. The Security IC
                      Embedded Software can enable/disable the EEPROM double read function.
                      Specific functional units of the P6022y VB are equipped with further fault injection
                      detection. This comprises the Secure Fetch for the processing of code and data by the
                      CPU or special circuitry within a functional unit. The functional units are the Program
                      Counter, the stack pointer, the CPU control register, the MMU address cache and control
                      registers, the SBC interface for the Triple-DES and the AES coprocessors, the Fame2
                      coprocessor, Copy Machine control registers and hardware configuration as well as test
                      control registers. Furthermore the P6022y VB contains a watchdog timer which can be
                      enabled and configured by the Security IC Embedded Software to protect the program
                      execution.
                      If one of the monitored parameters is out of the specified range, either (i) a reset is forced
                      and the actually running program is aborted or (ii) an exception is raised which interrupts
                      the program flow and allows a reaction of the Security IC Embedded Software. In case
                      minor configuration option “Inverse EEPROM Error Correction” is enabled (see Section
                      1.4.2.2) the probability to detect fault injection attack detectors at the EEPROM memory
                      and interface increases and the error correction logic raises an exception when detecting
                      an error. The RAM memory is equipped with additional parity bits which are checked
                      when the corresponding data stored in RAM is read. Additionally a RAM parity watchdog
                      mechanism is supported which checks the parity bits of the complete RAM in random
                      order when the Security IC Embedded Software is not accessing the RAM. In case of
                      detected RAM parity attack detectors both mechanisms trigger a security reset. In case
                      the P6022y VB processes a reset all components of the P6022y VB are initialised with
                      their reset values and the P6022y VB provides a reset cause indicator to the Security IC
                      Embedded Software. In the case an exception is raised an indicator for the reason of the
                      exception is provided. The P6022y VB defends the sensors from being disabled by the
                      Security IC Embedded Software.
                      The P6022y VB controls the specified range of the stack pointer. The stack pointer and
                      the related control logic are implemented threefold for the User Mode, System Mode
                      and Super System Mode (comprising Boot Mode, Test Mode and Firmware Mode). An
                      exception is generated in case the specified limits are exceeded.
                      In addition, SF.OPC comprises a sensor, which checks the high voltage of the write
                      process to the EEPROM during each write sequence. The result of this sensor must
                      be read from a Special Function Register and does not force an automatic event (e.g.
                      exception).
                      SF.PHY: Protection against Physical Manipulation
                      SF.PHY protects the P6022y VB against manipulation of (i) the IC hardware, (ii) the
                      IC Dedicated Software in ROM, (iii) the Security IC Embedded Software in ROM and
                      EEPROM, (iv) the Application Data in EEPROM and RAM including TSF data in the
                      Security Rows. It also protects User Data and TSF data against disclosure by physical
                      probing when stored or while being processed by the P6022y VB.
                      The protection of the P6022y VB comprises several security mechanisms in design and
                      construction, which make reverse-engineering and tamper attacks more difficult. These
                      mechanisms comprise dedicated shielding techniques for the P6022y VB and specific
                      encryption- and check mechanisms for the memories and internal buses. SF.PHY
                      supports the efficiency of other portions of the security functionality.

                      SF.PHY also supports the integrity of the EEPROM, RAM and the ROM. The EEPROM
                      is able to correct a 1-bit error within each byte. The EEPROM corrects these attack
                      detectors automatically without user interaction. The RAM and the ROM provide a parity
                      check. In both cases a reset is forced based on a parity error.
                      The CRC coprocessor is used in Boot Mode by the IC dedicated Software for calculation
                      of a CRC checksum for integrity protection of TSF data.
                      SF.PUF: User Data Protection using PUF
                      SF.PUF implements a mechanism to seal/unseal the user data stored in shared
                      memory against unintended disclosure. SF.PUF encrypts/decrypts the user data with
                      a cryptographic key derived from the PUF data. SF.PUF calculates a MAC as a PUF
                      authentication value. SF.PUF provides this sealing/unsealing mechanism through the
                      specified interfaces FVEC2 (see Fig. 2) only.

                      SF.LOG implements security mechanisms to limit or eliminate the information in the
                      shape and amplitude of signals or in the time between events, which might be found by
                      measuring such signals. This comprises the power supply, signals on other pads, which
                      are not intentionally used for communication by the terminal or the Security IC Embedded
                      Software as well as emanation of the hardware platform. Thereby SF.LOG prevents from
                      disclosure of User Data and TSF data stored and/or processed in the Security IC through
                      measurement of power consumption or emanation and subsequent complex signal
                      analysis. This protection of the P6022y VB is enforced by several security mechanisms in
                      the design, which support these portions of security functionality.
                      The Triple-DES coprocessor includes specific security mechanisms to prevent SPA/
                      DPA analysis of shape and amplitude of the power consumption and emanation. The
                      implementation of the Triple-DES coprocessor further ensures that the calculation time is
                      independent from the chosen key value and plain/cipher text.
                      The AES coprocessor includes specific security mechanisms to prevent SPA/DPA
                      analysis of shape and amplitude of the power consumption and emanation. The
                      implementation of the AES coprocessor further ensures that the calculation time is
                      independent from the chosen key any plain/cipher text for a given key length.
                      The Fame2 coprocessor provides measures to prevent timing attacks on basic modular
                      function. The calculation time of an operation depends on the lengths of the operands,
                      but not on the value of the operands, with the following exceptions: multiplication with
                      reduction, modular inversion and modular division. These three operations have no
                      constant timing due to correction cycles that are needed based on the calculation
                      method. In addition, mechanisms are included, which provide limitations of the capability
                      for the analysis of shape and amplitude of the power consumption. Of course the Fame2
                      coprocessor does not realise an algorithm on its own and algorithm-specific leakage
                      countermeasures have to be added by the Security IC Embedded Software when using
                      the Fame2 coprocessor.
                      Additional security mechanisms can be configured by the Security IC Embedded
                      Software. This comprises the configuration of the clock that can be used to prevent the
                      synchronisation between internal operations and external clock or characteristics of the
                      power consumption that can be used as trigger signal to support leakage attacks (DPA or
                      timing attacks)
                      Some mechanisms described for SF.PHY (e.g. the encryption mechanisms) and for
                      SF.OPC (e.g. the filter mechanisms) support SF.LOG.

                                                                                                                   Security Target Lite


                      SF.COMP provides control of the CPU mode for (i) Boot Mode, (ii) Test Mode and
                      (iii) Firmware Mode. This includes protection of electronic fuses stored in a protected
                      memory area, the so-called Security Rows, and the possibility to store initialisation or
                      pre-personalisation data in the so-called FabKey Area.
                      Control of the CPU mode for Boot Mode, Test Mode and Firmware Mode prevents abuse
                      of test functions after TOE delivery. It also inhibits abuse of features, which are used
                      during start-up or reset to configure the P6022y VB.
                      The integrity control of electronic fuses ensures secure storage and setup of
                      configuration and calibration data, during the start-up in Boot Mode. The protection
                      of electronic fuses especially ensures that configuration options with regard to the
                      security functionality cannot be changed, abused or influenced in any way. The transfer
                      of the content of the electronic fuses into the related hardware configuration registers
                      is protected by a CRC checksum generated using the CRC coprocessor. SF.COMP
                      ensures that activation or deactivation of security mechanisms cannot be influenced by
                      the Security IC Embedded Software so that the TSF provides self-protection against
                      interference and tampering by untrusted Security IC Embedded Software.
                      SF.COMP protects CPU mode switches regarding Boot Mode, Test Mode and Firmware
                      Mode in the following way: Switching from Boot Mode to Test Mode or Firmware Mode is
                      allowed, switching from these modes back to Boot Mode is prevented. Switching to Test
                      Mode is prevented as well after TOE delivery, because Test Mode then is permanently
                      disabled. SF.COMP also ensures that Boot Mode is active only in the boot phase during
                      start-up or reset of the P6022y VB, and cannot be invoked afterwards. Therefore, once
                      the P6022y VB has left the test phase and each time the P6022y VB completed start-up
                      or reset, Firmware Mode is the only Super System Mode available.
                      The TSF controls access to the Security Rows, the top-most 512 Bytes of the EEPROM
                      memory, accessible at reserved addresses in the memory map. The available EEPROM
                      memory space for the Security IC Embedded Software is reduced by this area.
                      SF.COMP provides three memory areas in the Security Rows, which can be used by the
                      Security IC Embedded Software. These are
                      • the User Read Only Area
                      • the User Write Protected Area and
                      • the User Write Once Area.
                      The User Read Only Area contains 32 bytes, which are read-only for the Security IC
                      Embedded Software. The User Write Protected area contains 16 bytes, which can be
                      write-protected by the Security IC Embedded Software on demand. The User Write Once
                      Area contains 32 bytes of which each bit can separately be set to ‘1’ once only, and not
                      reset to ‘0’.
                      SF.COMP also provides a memory area in the Security Row where the current values
                      for the Post Delivery Configuration (see SS.RECONFIG). This area cannot be accessed
                      by the Security IC Embedded Software, but it can be accessed by the Resource
                      Configuration Firmware.
                      If minor configuration option “Card Disable” feature is used (refer to section 1.4.2.2)
                      SF.COMP inhibits any start-up of the Security IC Embedded Software once the Security
                      IC Embedded Software disables the card.
                      If minor configuration option “EEPROM application content erase” is used (see Section
                      1.4.2.2) SF.COMP erases the application data stored in the EEPROM once the Security
                      IC Embedded Software has activated this security feature.

                      SF.COMP also provides the FabKey Area where initialisation and identification data can
                      be stored. The FabKey area does not belong to the Security Rows and is not protected
                      by hardware mechanisms. The FabKey Area as well as the Security Rows can be used
                      by SF.COMP to store a unique identification for each die.
                      The complete EEPROM is initialized during wafer testing and pre-personalisation. The
                      values for the Security Row depend on the configuration options and choice of the
                      Security IC Embedded Software developer. The values for the application EEPROM
                      depend on the choice of the Security IC Embedded Software developer and are
                      included in the Order Entry Form. The User Write Protected Area and the User Write
                      Once Area are designed to store the identification of a (fully personalised) Security IC
                      (e.g. smartcard) or a sequence of events over the life-cycle, that can be coded by an
                      increasing number of bits set to "one" or protecting bytes, respectively.
                      SF.COMP limits the capabilities of the test functions and provides test personnel during
                      phase 3 with the capability to store identification and/or pre-personalisation data and/or
                      supplements of the Security IC Embedded Software in the EEPROM. SF.COMP provides
                      self-protection against interference and tampering by untrusted subjects both in the Test
                      Mode and in the other modes. It also enforces the separation of domains regarding the
                      IC Dedicated Software and the Security IC Embedded Software.
                      SF.MEM_ACC: Memory Access Control
                      SF.MEM_ACC controls access of any subject (program code comprising processor
                      instructions) to the memories of the P6022y VB through the Memory Management Unit.
                      Memory access is based on virtual addresses that are mapped to physical addresses.
                      The CPU always uses virtual addresses. The Memory Management Unit performs the
                      translation from virtual to physical addresses and the physical addresses are passed
                      from the Memory Management Unit to the memory interfaces to access the memories.
                      Access control is conducted in two ways:
                      • Memory partitioning: Each memory type ROM, RAM and EEPROM is partitioned into
                        two parts. In Boot Mode and Firmware Mode the CPU has access to the Firmware
                        EEPROM, Firmware RAM and Test-ROM. In System Mode and User Mode the CPU
                        has access to the Application EEPROM, Application RAM and Application ROM.
                        Access to both parts of each type is allowed in Test Mode for testing.
                      • Memory segmentation in User Mode: The three accessible parts of the memory in
                        ROM, RAM and EEPROM can be segmented into smaller memory areas. Access
                        rights (read/write or execute) can be defined for these segments. The operation read
                        and write are considered as one kind of operation, if one is allowed, so is the other.
                        However, in general the access to a segment can be denied.
                        In addition, access rights to Special Function Registers related to hardware
                        components can be defined for code executed in User Mode.
                      Memory partitioning is fixed and cannot be changed. It is determined during
                      production of the P6022y VB and is solely dependent on the major configuration (see
                      Section 1.4.2.1.1) and Post Delivery Configuration (see Section 1.4.2.3.1).
                      Memory segmentation can be defined in System Mode. The segmentation is active when
                      the CPU switches to User Mode. The segments, their access rights and the access
                      rights to Special Function Registers related to hardware components are defined in the
                      MMU Segment Table. The MMU Segment Table stores five values for each segment:
                      The memory access rights, the virtual start address of the segment, the virtual end
                      address of the segment, the address offset for the segment and the access rights to
                      Special Function Registers for code that is executed in the segment. The address offset
                      is used to relocate the segment anywhere in the memory map. The resulting address
                      computed by the Memory Management Unit can not overrule memory partitioning. Up

                      to 64 segments can be defined in the MMU Segment Table. Special configurations of
                      the memory access rights allow to specify less than 64 segments and to split the MMU
                      Segment Table into several parts being stored at different locations in memory.
                      Note that the MMU Segment Table itself is stored in the memory and therefore the table
                      itself can be placed in a segment accessible in User Mode.
                      In addition, SF.MEM_ACC permanently checks whether accessed addresses point to
                      physically implemented memory. Any access outside the boundaries of the physical
                      implemented memory in all CPU modes except the Test Mode and access to forbidden
                      memory addresses in User Mode are notified by raising an exception.
                      The Memory Management Unit also handles access rights to Special Function Registers
                      related to hardware components for code running in Firmware Mode. The configuration
                      of the access rights for User Mode and Firmware Mode are used by SF.SFR_ACC to
                      grant or block access to the related Special Function Registers. The access rights can
                      be defined for up to 16 groups of Special Function Registers, which are related to 16
                      hardware peripherals or memories described in [9], section 12.4. Thus, User Mode
                      and Firmware Mode can be restricted in their access to the Special Function Registers
                      related to hardware components on demand of the Security IC Embedded Software.
                      Note that SF.MEM_ACC only provides the access rights to SF.SFR_ACC, the access
                      control is enforced by SF.SFR_ACC.
                      SF.SFR_ACC: Special Function Register Access Control
                      SF.SFR_ACC controls access to the Special Function Registers and CPU mode
                      switches based on specific Special Function Register. SF.SFR_ACC implements access
                      control to the Special Function Registers as specified in the Access Control Policy and
                      the Security Functional Requirements FDP_ACC.1[SFR] and FDP_ACF.1[SFR].
                      The function of the Special Function Register and the CPU mode determine, whether
                      read and/or write access to a Special Function Register is allowed or not. Key registers
                      cannot be read since they are write-only to support the confidentiality of keys. Write
                      access is granted depending on the CPU mode. Similar for the output register of the
                      Random Number Generator, which is read-only based on its function, and read access is
                      granted based on the CPU mode.
                      SF.SFR_ACC controls accesses to Special Function Registers. If the access is not
                      allowed or the Special Function Register addressed by the code is not implemented an
                      exception is triggered. The Security IC Embedded Software can react on this exception.
                      Some Special Function Registers are implemented threefold, one for User Mode, a
                      second one for System Mode and a third one for Super System Mode meaning Boot
                      Mode, Test Mode and Firmware Mode. Hence, such Special Function Registers are
                      inherently separated and enforce the separation between the CPU modes.
                      SF.SFR_ACC relies on access rights to Special Function Registers related to hardware
                      components, which are provided by SF.MEM_ACC. Access rights to all other Special
                      Function Registers are pre-defined and cannot be configured by the code running on the
                      hardware platform.
                      This implies that code running in User Mode or Firmware Mode is not able to use
                      SS.RNG, SS.TDES, and SS.AES until access to the respective group of Special Function
                      Registers is explicitly granted by code running in System Mode. This holds for all 16
                      hardware components, which are controlled by the 16 groups of Special Function
                      Registers related to hardware components.
                      SF.SFR_ACC also implements transitions among CPU modes based on specific Special
                      Function Register.

                      The CPU mode changes by the following operations.
                      • Call of a system call vector (SVEC) address or a firmware vector (FVEC) address. A
                        call of a SVEC enables System Mode, a call of a FVEC sets enables Firmware Mode.
                        Calls of SVEC addresses are allowed in User Mode only, otherwise an exception is
                        raised.
                      • Execution of an exception or interrupt. Any event that leads to the execution of an
                        exception leads to a special status of the related CPU mode. Any further exception in
                        this special status forces a reset. Interrupts can be executed in User Mode or in System
                        Mode as well as in Firmware Mode. The Security IC Embedded Software running in
                        System Mode can configure this option at run time.
                      • Return from an exception/interrupt or vector call with a RETI instruction. This restores
                        the CPU mode before the event occurred. A RETI in User Mode is allowed only in case
                        interrupts are allowed to be executed in User Mode and an interrupt is actually active,
                        otherwise an exception is raised.
                      • Execution of an LCALL/ACALL/ECALL instruction to a specific address. A call of
                        address 0x800000 in System Mode enables User Mode and starts execution at this
                        (virtual) address. This is similar to a FVEC or SVEC call, but no return address is
                        pushed onto the stack.
                      • Direct modification of the specific Special Function Register. Hardware provided by
                        SF.SFR_ACC ensures that the bits can only be cleared. Therefore it is not possible
                        for code running in User Mode to enter System Mode, but System Mode can switch to
                        User Mode.
                      Two CPU modes are available to the Security IC Embedded Software, which are System
                      Mode and User Mode. System Mode is the more privileged CPU mode since it allows
                      access to all Special Function Registers related to hardware components and for system
                      management (i.e. configuration of Memory Management Unit, clock settings and some
                      mechanisms provided by SF.LOG). User Mode is the less privileged, but in regard to
                      hardware components it can be made as powerful as System Mode.
                      SF.SFR_ACC and SF.COMP together ensure that other CPU modes are not available
                      to the Security IC Embedded Software, but reserved for specific purposes fulfilled by the
                      IC Dedicated Software. As described above, SF.MEM_ACC provides the access control
                      information to Special Function Registers related to hardware components in Firmware
                      Mode and User Mode.
                      SF.FFW: Firmware Firewall
                      SF.FFW (Protected Firmware Mode) implements a mechanism to protect the application
                      data of the different firmware applications (NXP firmware functionality) running in
                      Firmware Mode by means of a firewall separating the application data between each
                      other. The firewall mechanism is based on the security features SF.MEM_ACC and
                      SF.SFR_ACC.
                      SF.FIRMWARE: Firmware Support
                      SF.FIRMWARE (Firmware Operating System) implements specific basic support
                      functionality for the Security IC Embedded Software. The basic support functionality is
                      implemented in a way that the protection and separation of the different type of User
                      Data is enforced. The security feature SF.FIRMWARE is based on the security features
                      SF.MEM_ACC, SF.SFR_ACC and SF.FFW.

                                    Additional SFR regarding cryptographic functionality
                                    The TSF provides cryptographic functionality to help satisfy several high-level security
                                    objectives. In order for a cryptographic operation to function correctly, the operation must
                                    be performed in accordance with a specified algorithm and with a cryptographic key of a
                                    specified size. The following Functional Requirements to the TOE can be derived from
                                    this CC component:

                                    Security Assurance Requirement ADV_SPM.1 requires the developer to provide a
                                    Security Policy Model for the Crypto Library. However, the N7021 hardware already
                                    provides a Security Policy Model (see [13] for details), which also applies unchanged
                                    to the composite product. As the SFRs introduced in this ST do not add a new Security
                                    Policy or change the rules of existing Security Policies of the hardware, there is no need
                                    for an additional Security Policy Model for the Crypto Library.

                           6.2.1 Refinements of the Security Assurance Requirements for EAL6+
                                    The Security Target claims strict conformance to the Protection Profile [5], and therefore
                                    it has to be conform to the refinements of the TOE security assurance requirements (see
                                    Application Note 23 of the PP [5]).
                                    The Hardware Security Target [13] for N7021 has chosen the evaluation assurance
                                    level EAL6+. The Security Target of the hardware platform with IC Dedicated Software
                                    including cryptographic library is based on the Protection Profile [5], which requires
                                    the lower level EAL4+. This implies that the refinements made in the Protection Profile
                                    [5], section 6.2.1 Refinements of the TOE Assurance Requirements, for EAL4+ had to
                                    be refined again in order to ensure EAL6+ in the Hardware Security Target (this was
                                    necessary for ALC_CMS.5, ALC_CMC.5, ADV_IMP.2, ATE_COV.3, and ADV_FSP.5).
                                    Since these refinements explain and interpret the CC for hardware, these refinements do
                                    not affect the additional software in this composite TOE. Therefore all refinements made
                                    in the PP [5] are valid without change for the composite TOE.

                              6.3 Security Requirements Rationale


                           6.3.1    Rationale for the Security Functional Requirements
                                    Section 6.3.1 of the PP [5] and Section 6.3.1 of the Hardware Security Target [13]
                                    provide the mapping between security functional requirements and security objectives of
                                    the TOE. This mapping entirely apply to this Security Target.
                                    This ST lists a number of security objectives and SFRs for Crypto Library, which are
                                    additional to both the PP and the Hardware ST. These are listed in the following table.

                                    • Each objective is directly implemented by a single SFR specifying the (cryptographic)
                                      service that the objective wishes to achieve (see the above table for the mapping).
                                    • The requirements and architectural measures that originally were taken from the
                                      Protection Profile [5] and thus were also part of the Security Target of the hardware
                                      (chip) evaluation support the security objectives:
                                      – FRU_FLT.2 and FPT_FLS.1 supports the objective by ensuring that the TOE works
                                        correctly (i.e., all of the TOE’s capabilities are ensured) within the specified operating

                                       are detected.
                                     – FDP_ITT.1[HW] (for User Data) and FPT_ITT.1[HW] (for TSF Data) ensure that no
                                       User Data (plain text data, keys) or TSF Data is disclosed when they are transmitted
                                       between different functional units of the TOE (i.e., the different memories, the CPU,
                                       cryptographic co-processors), thereby supporting the objective in keeping confidential
                                       data secret.
                                     – FDP_IFC.1 also supports the aspects of confidentiality by ensuring that User
                                       Data and TSF Data are not accessible from the TOE except when the Security IC
                                       Embedded Software decides to communicate them via an external interface.
                                     – FDP_RIP.1[SW] and FCS_CKM.4 ensures that the TOE provides procedural
                                       measures to prevent disclosure of memory contents that was used by the TOE. The
                                       Crypto Library supports FDP_RIP.1[SW] and FCS_CKM.4 by making all memory
                                       contents used by the library no longer available. Note that the requirement for
                                       residual information protection applies to all functionality of the Crypto Library.

                           6.3.2 Extended requirements
                                    This Security Target does not define extended requirements.

                           6.3.3 Dependencies of security requirements
                                    SFRs [FDP_ITC.1, or FDP_ITC.2 or FCS_CKM.1] are not included in this Security Target
                                    for FCS_COP.1/SHA since the TOE only provides a pure engine for these algorithms
                                    without additional features like the handling of keys or importing data from outside the
                                    TOE. Therefore the Security IC Embedded Software must fulfil these requirements
                                    related to the needs of the realized application.

                           6.3.4 Rationale for the Assurance Requirements
                                    The selection of assurance components and augmentations of Crypto Library on N7021
                                    is generally based on EAL6, the underlying Protection Profile [5], and the Security Target
                                    of the hardware [13] of the N7021.
                                    EAL6 was chosen to provide an even stronger baseline of assurance than the EAL4 in
                                    the Protection Profile. The augmentations ALC_FLR.1 and ASE_TSS.2 were chosen to
                                    extend the level of assurance even further.

7         TOE Summary Specification
                                    This chapter describes the “IT Security Functionality”.

                              7.1 IT Security Functionality
                                    The evaluation of this cryptographic library is performed as a composite evaluation,
                                    where the TOE comprises both the underlying hardware and the embedded software
                                    (Crypto Library). The TOE of this composite evaluation therefore extends the security
                                    functionality already available in the chip platform (see section 7.1 “Portions of the TOE
                                    Security Functionality” of the Hardware Security [13]).
                                    The security functionality of N7021
                                    The security functionality of the hardware platform for the N7021 is described in the
                                    Hardware Security Target [13]. They entirely apply to this Security Target.
                                    Note 8. The security functionality SF.LOG is extended by the Crypto Library as described
                                    in Security Features of the TOE.


                                    The additional security functionality provided by the TOE is described in the following
                                    sub-sections.
                                    The IT security functionalities directly correspond to the TOE security functional
                                    requirements defined in Section 6.1. The definitions of the IT security functionalities refer
                                    to the corresponding security functional requirements.

                           7.1.1 Security Services of the TOE

                         7.1.1.1    SS.RSA

                                    The TOE provides functions that implement the RSA algorithm and the RSA-CRT
                                    algorithm for data encryption, decryption, signature and verification. All algorithms are
                                    defined in PKCS #1, v2.2 (RSAEP, RSADP, RSAP1, RSAVP1)
                                    This routine supports various key lengths from 512 bits to 4096 bits.
                                    The TOE contains modular exponentiation functions, which, together with other functions
                                    in the TOE, perform the operations required for RSA encryption or decryption. Two
                                    different RSA algorithms are supported by the TOE, namely the "Simple Straight Forward
                                    Method" (called RSA "straight forward", the key consists of the pair n and d) and RSA
                                    using the "Chinese Remainder Theorem" (RSA CRT, the key consists of the quintuple p,
                                    q, dp, dq, qInv).
                                    Attack resistance for this security functionality is discussed in Security architectural
                                    information.
                                    This security functionality covers:
                                    • FCS_COP.1/RSA

                         7.1.1.2    SS.RSA_Pad

                                    The TOE provides functions that implement the RSA algorithm and the RSA-CRT
                                    algorithm for message and signature encoding. This IT security functionality supports the
                                    EME-OAEP and EMSA-PSS signature scheme. All algorithms are defined in PKCS #1,
                                    v2.2 (EME-OAEP, EMSA-PSS)

6.1.5                  Memory access control
Usage of multiple applications in one Smartcard often requires code and data separation in order to prevent
that one application can access code and/or data of another application. For this reason the TOE provides Area
based Memory Access Control. The underlying Memory Protection Unit (MPU) is documented in Appendix B3.5
of the ARMv7 M architecture reference manual [ARMv7M].
In particular, the MPU provides full support for:
 Protection regions.
 Overlapping protection regions, with ascending region priority:
  − Region 7 = highest priority.
  − Region 0 = lowest priority.
 Access permissions.
   MPU mismatches and permission violations invoke the programmable-priority MemManage fault handler.

The MPU can be used to:
   Enforce privilege rules, preventing user applications from corrupting operating system data.
   Separate processes, blocking the active task from accessing other tasks’ data.
   Enforce access rules, allowing memory regions to be defined as read-only or detecting unexpected memory
    accesses.

The SFRs are provided by the Memory Access Control Policy (FDP_ACC.1 and dependencies).

A.      Certification

1.      Preliminary Remarks
Under the BSIG1 Act, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) has the task of
issuing certificates for information technology products.
Certification of a product is carried out on the instigation of the vendor or a distributor,
hereinafter called the sponsor.
A part of the procedure is the technical examination (evaluation) of the product according
to the security criteria published by the BSI or generally recognised security criteria.
The evaluation is normally carried out by an evaluation facility recognised by the BSI or by
BSI itself.
The result of the certification procedure is the present Certification Report. This report
contains among others the certificate (summarised assessment) and the detailed
Certification Results.
The Certification Results contain the technical description of the security functionality of
the certified product, the details of the evaluation (strength and weaknesses) and
instructions for the user.

2.      Specifications of the Certification Procedure
The certification body conducts the procedure according to the criteria laid down in the
following:
●   Act on the Federal Office for Information Security 1
●   BSI Certification and Approval Ordinance2
●   BSI Schedule of Costs 3
●   Special decrees issued by the Bundesministerium des Innern (Federal Ministry of the
    Interior)
●   DIN EN ISO/IEC 17065 standard
●   BSI certification: Scheme documentation describing the certification process (CC-
    Produkte) [3]
●   BSI certification: Scheme documentation on requirements for the Evaluation Facility, its
    approval and licencing process (CC-Stellen) [3]
●   Common Criteria for IT Security Evaluation (CC), Version 3.1 4 [1] also published as
    ISO/IEC 15408.

3.      Recognition Agreements
In order to avoid multiple certification of the same product in different countries a mutual
recognition of IT security certificates - as far as such certificates are based on ITSEC or
CC - under certain conditions was agreed.

3.1.    European Recognition of CC – Certificates (SOGIS-MRA)
The SOGIS-Mutual Recognition Agreement (SOGIS-MRA) Version 3 became effective in
April 2010. It defines the recognition of certificates for IT-Products at a basic recognition
level and, in addition, at higher recognition levels for IT-Products related to certain SOGIS
Technical Domains only.
The basic recognition level includes Common Criteria (CC) Evaluation Assurance Levels
EAL 1 to EAL 4. For "Smartcards and similar devices" a SOGIS Technical Domain is in
place. For "HW Devices with Security Boxes" a SOGIS Technical Domains is in place, too.
In addition, certificates issued for Protection Profiles based on Common Criteria are part of
the recognition agreement.
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes, details on
recognition, and the history of the agreement can be seen on the website at
https://www.sogis.eu.
The SOGIS-MRA logo printed on the certificate indicates that it is recognised under the
terms of this agreement by the related bodies of the signatory nations. A disclaimer
beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of recognition.
This certificate is recognized under SOGIS-MRA for all assurance components selected.

3.2.    International Recognition of CC – Certificates (CCRA)
The international arrangement on the mutual recognition of certificates based on the CC
(Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement, CCRA-2014) has been ratified on 08
September 2014. It covers CC certificates based on collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP)
(exact use), CC certificates based on assurance components up to and including EAL 2 or
               can be used independently of each other:
                            ECC_ECDSAKeyGen

                          224, 233, 256, 283, 320, 384, 409, 512 or 521 bits that meet the following:
                          ECDSA Key Generation:
                          1. According to the appendix “A4.3 Elliptic Curve Key Pair Generation” in ANSI [23]:
                          The optional cofactor h is not supported.
                          2. According to section “6.4.2 Generation of signature key and verification key” in
                          ISO/IEC [27].
                          3. According to appendix “A.16.9 An algorithm for generating EC keys” in IEEE [29]

Note1 for FCS_CKM.1/EC-3:
For easy integration of EC functions into the user’s operating system and/or application, the library contains
single cryptographic functions respectively primitives which are compliant to the standard. The primitives are
referenced above. Therefore, the library supports the user to develop an application representing the standard if
required.

                            1. According to section “5.4.1 Standard Diffie-Hellman Primitive” in ANSI [24]
                            Unlike section 5.4.1(3) our implementation not only returns the x-coordinate of the
                            shared secret, but rather the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate.
                            2. According to “Appendix D.6 Key agreement of Diffie-Hellman” type in ISO/IEC [28]
                            The function enables the operations described in appendix D.6
                            3. According to section “7.2.1 ECSVHDP-DH” in IEEE [29]
                            Unlike section 7.2.1 our implementation not only returns the x-coordinate of the
                            shared secret, but rather the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate.

Note for FCS_COP.1/ECDH-3:
The security functional requirement covers the standard Brainpool [19] and NIST [26] Elliptic Curves with key
lengths of 224, 233, 256, 283, 320, 384, 409, 512 or 521 Bits, due to national AIS32 regulations by the BSI.
Furthermore, 160, 163, 192 bits are supported. Numerous other curve types, being also secure in terms of side
channel attacks on this TOE, exist, which the user optionally can add in the composition certification process.
End of note

Note 2 for FCS_COP.1/ECDH-3:
For easy integration of EC functions into the user’s operating system and/or application, the library contains
single cryptographic functions respectively primitives which are compliant to the standard. The primitives are
referenced above. Therefore, the library supports the user to develop an application representing the standard if
required.
End of note.

Note 3 for FCS_COP.1/ECDH-3:
The TOE can be delivered with or without the EC library. In the case the TOE comes without, it does not provide
the Additional Specific Security Functionality Elliptic Curve Cryptography realized with the security functional
requirements FCS_COP.1/ECSA, FCS_COP.1/ECDH and FCS_CKM.1/EC. In case of a blocked Crypto2304T, the
RSA and EC cryptographic library cannot be used. In case of a blocked Crypto2304T the optionally delivered
cryptographic RSA and EC, as well as the supporting Toolbox cannot be used in that TOE product.
End of note.

Note 4 for FCS_COP.1/ECDH-3:

7.1.6          Application Note to FPT_FLS.1 Failure with preservation of secure state
The SFR FPT_FLS.1 is defined in the PP [9] but with application note 14 it is required to describe the secure state:
Where ever FPT_FLS.1 is claimed it depends on the source or affected piece of data the failure was detected.
Induced failures on other than memory contents could in the worse lead to exploitable situations if not
discovered and treated properly. This includes i.e. internal transported keys and other TSF data. For that reasons
the integrity of the transport ways and also the modules the TSF and critical data are used is protected against
failure.
Depending on the criticality where the failure occurred and in most cases a security reset is triggered. Only in
case of a peripheral bus error or an address translation mismatch, a user software action is required as described
in the user guidance.
In case of a security reset, the user cannot take any action. The chip immediately stops operation and reboots.


7.2            Support by the Flash Loader

The TOE provides the Flash Loader to download user data into the SOLID FLASH™ NVM, either during
production of the TOE or at customer site. The Flash Loader is dedicated for usage by authorized users only in
secured and insecure environment during the production up to Phase 6 Security IC Personalisation.
The Flash Loader has to be permanently deactivated before entering Phase 7 Security IC end-usage.
For this reason the TOE shall meet the requirements as defined and described in the PP [9] section 7.3 Packages
for Loader and 7.2 Package Authentication of the Security IC:
     Limited capabilities (FMT_LIM.1/Loader),
     Limited availability – Loader (FMT_LIM.2/Loader),
     Authentication Proof of Identity (FIA_API.1),
     Inter-TSF trusted channel (FTP_ITC.1),
     Basic data exchange confidentiality (FDP_UCT.1),
     Data exchange integrity (FDP_UIT.1),
     Subset access control – Loader (FDP_ACC.1/Loader) and
     Security attribute based access control – Loader (FDP_ACF.1/Loader)
as defined in the PP [9], section 7.2 and 7.3.

The Flash Loader supports the following security function policy (SFP):
    Loader SFP:
        provides the mutual authentication between the TOE and the administrator user or download operator
        user and the download of the user data into the memory of the TOE.

The Flash Loader supports the following two subjects:
    Administrator user:
        is enabled performing mutual authentication with the keys Kc and Kd, to manage (set, exchange, delete)
        the keys Kc, Kd and Kfdi and to process the download of the user data into the memory of the TOE.
    Download operator user:
        is enabled performing mutual authentication with Kd, to exchange the key Kd and to perform the
        download of the user data into the memory of the TOE. He can also delete Kfdi.

 Vulnerability Assessment        AVA_VAN.5           Advanced methodical vulnerability testing      in PP [9]


7.3.1           Refinements
Some refinements are taken unchanged from the PP [9]. In some cases a clarification is necessary. In Table 17 an
overview is given where the refinement is done.
The refinements from the PP [9] have to be discussed here in the Security Target, as the assurance level is
increased. The refinements from the PP [9] are included in the chosen assurance level EAL 6 augmented with
ALC_FLR.1.
7.3.1.1         Development (ADV)
ADV_IMP Implementation Representation:
The refined assurance package ADV_IMP.1 implementation representation of the TSF requires the availability of
the entire implementation representation, a mapping of the design description to the implementation
representation with a level of detail that the TSF can be generated without further design decisions. In addition,
the correspondence of design description and implementation representation shall be demonstrated.
The covered higher assurance package ADV_IMP.2 requires a complete and not curtailed mapping of the
implementation representation of the TSF, and the mapping of the design description to the entire
implementation representation. In addition, the correspondence of design description and the implementation
representation shall be demonstrated. The ADV_IMP.1 aspect and refinement remains therefore valid. The
enhancement underlines the refinement in the PP [9] and by that the entirely complete design i.e. not curtailed
representation with according mapping was provided, demonstrated and reviewed.

ADV_FSP Functional Specification:
The ADV_FSP.4 package requires a functional description of the TSFIs and there assignment to SFR-enforcing,
SFR-supporting, SFR-non-interfering, including related error messages, the assurance package. The
enhancement of ADV_FSP.5 requires additionally a complete semi-formal functional specification with
additional error information. In addition the package includes a tracing from the functional specification to the
SFRs, as well as the TSFIs descriptions including error messages not resulting from an invocation of a TSFI.
These aspects from ADV_FSP.5 are independent from the ADV_FSP.4 refinements from the PP [9] but
constitute an enhancement of it. By that the aspects of ADV_FSP.4 and its refinement in the PP [9] apply also
here. The assurance and evidence was provided accordingly.

ADV_SPM Formal Security Policy Model
It is the objective of this family to provide additional assurance from the development of a formal security policy
model of the TSF, and establishing a correspondence between the functional specification and this security
policy model. Preserving internal consistency the security policy model is expected to formally establish the
security principles from its characteristics by means of a mathematical proof.

Note:
All HSL versions implement tearing save behavior for the SOLID Flash™ NVM. Its features are close to physical
SOLID Flash™ NVM behavior which is not part of the SPM. Therefore, the HSL functionality contributing to
FPT_FLS:1, FPT_PHP.3 and FDP_SDI.2 is excluded from the SPM even though it contributes to the named SFRs
which are listed and modelled in the ADV_SPM.1.1D definition.
End of note.

Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)


7.3.1.2        Life-cycle Support (ALC)
ALC_CMS Configuration Management Scope:
The refinement of ALC_CMS.4 in the PP [9] defines with some conditions the possibility that the Security IC
embedded firmware can be part of the delivered TOE. This is the case as the Security IC embedded firmware –
regardless of the version in use - and the optional software are part of TOE and delivered together with the TOE
as the firmware and optional software are stored in the ROM and/or SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The presence of the
optional parts belongs to the user order. Both, the firmware and software delivered with the TOE are controlled
entirely by Infineon Technologies.
In addition, the TOE offers the possibility that the user can download his software at his own premises. These
parts of the software are user controlled only and are not part of this TOE. The download of this solely user
controlled software into the SOLID FLASH™ NVM is protected by strong authentication means. In addition, the
download itself could also be encrypted.
The requirements by ALC_CMS.4 are fulfilled including the refinements from the PP [9].
The ALC_CMS.5 implements the additional requirement to include development tools and related information
into the configuration list. This add on has no influence on the refinement of ALC_CMS.4 in the PP [9] as the
delivery of Security IC embedded firmware is independent from the TOE development tools and related
information. The package ALC_CMS.5 is therefore an enhancement to ACL_CMS.4 and the package with its
refinement in the PP [9] remains valid. The assurance and evidence was provided accordingly.

ALC_CMC Configuration Management Capabilities:
The PP refinement from the assurance package ALC_CMC.4 Production support, acceptance procedures and
automation points out that the configuration items comprise all items defined under ALC_CMS to be tracked
under configuration management. In addition a production control system is required guaranteeing the
traceability and completeness of different charges and lots. Also the number of wafers, dies and chips must be
tracked by this system as well as procedures applied for managing wafers, dies or complete chips being removed
from the production process in order to verify and to control predefined quality standards and production
parameters. It has to be controlled that these wafers, dies or assembled devices are returned to the same
production stage from which they are taken or they have to be securely stored or destroyed otherwise.
The additionally covered extended package of ALC_CMC.5 Advance Support requires advanced support
considering the automatisms configuration management systems, acceptance and documentation procedures
of changes, role separation with regard to functional roles of personnel, automatisms for tracking and version
controlling in those systems, and includes also production control systems. The additional aspects of
ADV_CMC.5 constitute an enhancement of ACL_CMC.4 and therefore the aspects and ACL_CMC.4 refinements
in the PP [9] remain valid. The assurance and evidence was provided.

ALC_DVS Development Security:
The requirement ALC_DVS.2 is refined in the PP [9] requiring the development security documentation
comprising all the physical, procedural, personnel, and other security measures that are necessary to protect the
confidentiality and integrity of the TOE design and implementation in its development environment.
The documentation and evidence was given, reviewed, audited and thus the assurance and evidence was
provided accordingly.

Considering the GBIC requirements as outlined in section 10 this assurance class is refined with the confirmation
that the:
      keys are generated with sufficient entropy
      the keys are stored within a HSM as integral part of the vendor environment
      the keys are stored in the non-volatile memory of the chip
All these requirements were subject of an audit; assurance and evidence was provided.

ALC_DEL Delivery Procedure:
Considering the GBIC requirements as outlined in section 10 this assurance class is refined with the confirmation
that the delivery process of the Flash Loader keys - as referenced in the section 10 - is separated from the chip
delivery to the user.


7.3.1.3         Tests (ATE)
ATE_COV Test Coverage:
The PP refined assurance package ATE_COV.2 Analysis of coverage addresses the extent to which the TSF is
tested, and whether or not the testing is sufficiently extensive to demonstrate that the TSF operates as specified.
It includes the test documentation of the TSFIs in the functional specification. In particular the refinement
requires that The TOE must be tested under different operating conditions within the specified ranges. In
addition, the existence and effectiveness of mechanisms against physical attacks should be covered by evidence
that the TOE has the particular physical characteristics. This is furthermore detailed in the PP [9].
This assurance package ATE_COV.2 has been enhanced to ATE_COV.3 to cover the rigorous analysis of
coverage. This requires the presence of evidence that exhaustive testing on rigorous entirely all interfaces as
documented in the functional specification was conducted. By that ATE_COV.2 and refinements as given in the
PP [9] are enhanced by ATE_COV.3 and remain as well. The TSFIs were completely tested according to
ATE_COV.3 and the assurance and evidence was provided.


7.3.1.4         AVA_VAN Vulnerability Analysis
The assurance package AVA_VAN remains unchanged compared to the forerunner processes and requires
advanced methodical vulnerability analysis.

7.4           Security Requirements Rationale

7.4.1         Rationale for the Security Functional Requirements
The objectives O.Authentication and OE.TOE_Auth are discussed in the PP [9] chapter 7.2.1.
The objectives O.Cap_Avail_Loader and OE.Lim_Block_Loader and the covering security functional
requirements FMT_LIM.1/Loader and FMT_LIM.2/Loader are discussed in the PP [9] chapter 7.3.1.
The policy P.Ctrl_Loader and the objectives O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader and OE.Loader_usage are discussed in the PP
[9] chapter 7.3.2.

Additionally, the objective O.Add-Function includes the objectives implemented by the CIPURSE™
Cryptographic Library versions: O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL, O.Prot_Integrity and O.Prot_Confidentiality.
These extended objectives are discussed in this ST in chapter 5.5 P.Add functions.

The additional objectives O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality is defined in chapter 5.1 and 5.8 in this document.
PP [9] chapter 6.1 includes also the definition of FDP_SDI.2 „Stored data integrity monitoring and action“.
While the above mentioned security functional requirements rationale of the TOE are defined and described in
PP [9] section 6.3.1, the additional introduced SFRs are listed and discussed below:

Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)


For clarity please find following assignment to versions:
     ACL-1 covers version v2.08.007
     ACL-2 covers version v2.07.003
     ACL-3 covers version v2.06.003
     SCL-1 covers version v2.04.002
     SCL-2 covers version v2.02.010
     CCL covers version v02.00.0004


 7.4.1.1       Cryptographic Aspects
The justification related to the security objective “Additional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions)”
is as follows:
The security functional requirement(s) “Cryptographic operation (FCS_COP.1)” exactly require(s) those functions
to be implemented which are demanded by O.Add-Functions:
      The ACL library – regardless of the version chosen – implements the SFRs FCS_CKM.1/RSA, supporting
          the generation of RSA keys, and the FCS_CKM.1/EC, supporting the generation of EC keys, needed for
          these cryptographic operations.
          To sum up, the ACL versions implement the SFRs as follows:
              o FCS_COP.1/RSA-1, FCS_COP.1/ECDSA-1, FCS_COP.1/ECDH-1, FCS_CKM.1/RSA-1, and
                  FCS_CKM/EC-1 respectively
              o FCS_COP.1/RSA-2, FCS_COP.1/ECDSA-2, FCS_COP.1/ECDH-2, FCS_CKM.1/RSA-2, and
                  FCS_CKM/EC-2 respectively
              o FCS_COP.1/RSA-3, FCS_COP.1/ECDSA-3, FCS_COP.1/ECDH-3, FCS_CKM.1/RSA-3, and
                  FCS_CKM/EC-3
      The SCL library of version v2.04.002 implements the function of cipher based message authentication
          code CMAC, supporting the authenticity and integrity of data blocks for example used for messages.
      The CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library implements the SFRs FCS_COP.1/CCL Cryptographic Operation
          CCL Trusted Channel, establishing the trusted channel between two authenticated entities and
          FCS_CKM.1/CCL Cryptographic key generation, supporting the generation of the keys used for
          authentication and confidentiality. The CIPURSE™ CL operation requires the presence of the SCP.

The implementation covers the functional requirements and meets the objective O.Add-Functions.
The use of the supporting library Toolbox has no impact on any security functional requirement nor does the use
generate additional requirements. The Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

All these requirements have to be fulfilled to support OE.Resp-Appl for the SFRs implemented by the:
      SCP:
             o FCS_COP.1/TDES
             o FCS_COP.1/AES
      SCL for version v2.04.002:
             o FCS_COP.1/TDES-SCL-1
             o FCS_COP.1/AES-SCL-1
             o FCS_COP.1/CMAC-SCL-1
      SCL for version v2.02.010:
             o FCS_COP.1/TDES-SCL-2
             o FCS_COP.1/AES-SCL-2
      CCL for version v02.00.0004:

              o   FCS_CKM.4/CCL Cryptographic key destruction

Nevertheless, the developer of the Smartcard Embedded Software must ensure that the additional functions are
used as specified and that the User data of the Composite TOE processed by these functions are protected as
defined for the application context. These issues are addressed by the specific security functional requirements:
     [FDP_ITC.1 Import of user data of the Composite TOE without security attributes or
        FDP_ITC.2 Import of user data of the Composite TOE with security attributes or
        FCS_CKM.1 Cryptographic key generation],
     FCS_CKM.4 Cryptographic key destruction

The security functional requirements required to meet the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing,
    O.Malfunction, O.Phys-Manipulation and O.Leak-Forced define how to implement the specific security
functionality. However, key-dependent functions could be implemented in the Smartcard Embedded Software.

The usage of cryptographic algorithms requires the use of appropriate keys. Otherwise these cryptographic
functions do not provide security. The keys have to be unique with a very high probability, and must have a
certain cryptographic strength etc. In case of a key import into the TOE (which is usually after TOE delivery) it
has to be ensured that quality and confidentiality are maintained. Keys for DES and AES are provided by the
environment. Keys for RSA and EC algorithms can be provided either by the TOE or the environment.

The justification of the security objective and the additional requirements (both for the TOE and its environment)
show that they do not contradict to the rationale already given in the Protection Profile for the assumptions,
policy and threats defined there.

Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)


 7.4.1.2       Hardware related Aspects
The security functional component Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2) has been newly created (Common
Criteria Part 2 extended). This component allows that particular parts of the security mechanisms and functions
provided by the TOE can be tested after TOE Delivery. This security functional component is used instead of the
functional component FPT_TST.1 from Common Criteria Part 2. For the user it is important to know which
security functions or mechanisms can be tested. The functional component FPT_TST.1 does not mandate to
explicitly specify the security functions being tested. In addition, FPT_TST.1 requires verification of the integrity
of TSF data and stored TSF executable code which might violate the security policy.
The tested security enforcing functions are SF_DPM Device Phase Management, SF_CS Cryptographic Support
and SF_PMA Protection against modifying attacks.

The justification related to the security objective “Protection against Physical Manipulation (O.Phys-
Manipulation)” is as follows:
The security functional requirement FPT_TST.2 will detect attempts to conduce a physical manipulation on the
monitoring functions of the TOE. The objective of FPT_TST.2 is O.Phys-Manipulation. The physical manipulation
will be tried to overcome security enforcing functions.

The security functional requirement “Subset access control (FDP_ACC.1)” with the related Security Function
Policy (SFP) “Memory Access Control Policy” exactly require the implementation of an area based memory
access control as required by O.Mem-Access. The related TOE security functional requirements FDP_ACC.1,
FDP_ACF.1, FMT_MSA.3, FMT_MSA.1 and FMT_SMF.1 cover this security objective. The implementation of
these functional requirements is represented by the dedicated privilege level concept.

The justification of the security objective and the additional requirements show that they do not contradict to
the rationale already given in the Protection Profile for the assumptions, policy and threats defined there.
Moreover, these additional security functional requirements cover the requirements by the PP [9] user data of
the Composite TOE protection of chapter 1.2.5 claim 35 and 36 which are not refined by the PP [9].
Nevertheless, the developer of the Smartcard Embedded Software must ensure that the additional functions are
used as specified and that the User data of the Composite TOE processed by these functions are protected as
defined for the application context. The TOE only provides the tool to implement the policy defined in the
context of the application.

The justification related to the security objective Protection against Malfunction due to Environmental Stress
(O.Malfunction) is as follows:
The security functional requirement Stored data integrity monitoring and action (FDP_SDI.2) requires the
implementation of an integrity observation and correction which is implemented by the Error Detection (EDC)
and Error Correction (ECC) measures. The EDC is present throughout all memories of the TOE while the ECC is
realized in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. These measures detect and inform about one and more bit errors. In case
of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM 1 bit errors of the data are corrected automatically. The ECC mechanism protects
the TOE from the use of corrupt data. Therefore FDP_SDI.2 is suitable to meet the security objective
O.Malfunction.

The presence of true random numbers is the security goal 4 (SG4) which is formalized in the objective O.RND
Random Numbers. This objective must be covered by fulfillment of the security functional requirement
FCS_RNG. This is defined in the PP [9] chapter 5.1. The requirement implements a quality metric which is defined
by national regulations. The implemented random number generation fulfils the definitions of AIS 31 [13] in the
quality classes as outlined in chapter 7.1.1.1. Therefore the SFR FCS_RNG and the objective O.RND are covered.

For this certification procedure the sponsor and applicant is: Infineon Technologies AG.
The product was developed by: Infineon Technologies AG.
The certification is concluded with the comparability check and the production of this
Certification Report. This work was completed by the BSI.

5.      Validity of the Certification Result
This Certification Report applies only to the version of the product as indicated. The
confirmed assurance package is valid on the condition that
●   all stipulations regarding generation, configuration and operation, as given in the
    following report, are observed,
●   the product is operated in the environment described, as specified in the following report
    and in the Security Target.
For the meaning of the assurance components and assurance levels please refer to CC
itself. Detailed references are listed in part C of this report.
The Certificate issued confirms the assurance of the product claimed in the Security Target
at the date of certification. As attack methods evolve over time, the resistance of the
certified version of the product against new attack methods needs to be re-assessed.
Therefore, the sponsor should apply for the certified product being monitored within the
assurance continuity program of the BSI Certification Scheme (e.g. by a re-assessment or
re-certification). Specifically, if results of the certification are used in subsequent evaluation
and certification procedures, in a system integration process or if a user's risk
management needs regularly updated results, it is recommended to perform a re-
assessment on a regular e.g. annual basis.
In order to avoid an indefinite usage of the certificate when evolved attack methods would
require a re-assessment of the products resistance to state of the art attack methods, the
maximum validity of the certificate has been limited. The certificate issued on 12 February
2020 is valid until 11 February 2025. Validity can be re-newed by re-certification.

 7.4.1.3       Flash Loader related Aspects
The justification related to the Flash Loader security objectives are as follows. Note that the following objectives
and related rationales apply only at TOE products coming with activated Flash Loader enabled for software or
data download by the user. In other cases the Flash Loader is not available anymore and the user data download
is completed. Depending on the capabilities of the user software these security functional requirements may
then reoccur as subject of the composite TOE.
The Flash Loader related objectives are:

The objective O.Authentication requires the presence of an authentication mechanism proving the identity of a
given security IC to an external entity. This objective is covered by the functional requirement FIA_API
Authentication Proof of Identity. The Flash Loader implements this functionality and outputs identification data
to external requesting entity. The user guidance describes in more detail how this authentication request is
applied and conducted by the external entity. As the functional requirements are met by the Flash Loader the
objective is covered.

The objective O.Cap_Avail_Loader requires limited capabilities of the Loader functionality and irreversible
termination of the Loader. First, this is covered by the functional requirement FMT_LIM.1/Loader which
implements protection against data manipulation and disclosure by unauthorized users after permanent
deactivation of the Flash Loader. Second, the functional requirement FMT_LIM.2/Loader limits the Flash Loader
availability after the download has been finished by the user. The Flash Loader provides a final locking command
which irreversibly terminates the Flash Loader availability. This command execution must be applied after user
has finalized his download. As the functional requirements are met by the Flash Loader the objective is covered.

The objectives O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader and O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality require that a trusted communication
channel with an authorized user, a confidentiality protection during the download and authentication of the user
data and access control for the usage of the Loader functionality are provided by the Loader.
Without successfully passing the authentication functionality of the Flash Loader no usage of the Flash Loader is
possible. Passing the authentication successfully assigns also a user role to the current user.
The Flash Loader implements mutual authentication functionality and if successfully passing this mutual
authentication, the TOE and the external user are established as trusted entities. Furthermore, the Flash Loader
enforces the exchange of the download key by the user which provides clear separation from the hardware
vendor and preserves confidentiality of the user data download. In addition, the Flash Loader preserves the
integrity of the downloaded data against for example induced errors by hashing functionality.
As the functional requirements are met by the Flash Loader the objective is covered.

Note regarding the Flash Loader:
The algorithm strength of the Flash Loader has not been cryptographic-analytically evaluated by the BSI, as
Infineon has implemented a proprietary extension.

Comment 1:
The dependency FMT_SMR.1 introduced by the two components FMT_MSA.1 and FMT_MSA.3 is considered to
be satisfied because the access control specified for the intended TOE is not role-based but enforced for each
subject. Therefore, there is no need to identify roles in form of a security functional requirement FMT_SMR.1.
End of comment.

Comment 2:
These requirements all address the appropriate management of cryptographic keys used by the specified
cryptographic function and are not part of the PP [9]. Most requirements concerning key management shall be
fulfilled by the environment since the Smartcard Embedded Software is designed for a specific application
context and uses the cryptographic functions provided by the TOE.
For the security functional requirements:
         SCP:
              o FCS_COP.1/TDES and
              o FCS_COP.1/AES
      SCL-1:
              o FCS_COP.1/TDES-SCL-1
              o FCS_COP.1/AES-SCL-1
              o FCS_COP.1/CMAC-SCL-1
      SCL-2:
              o FCS_COP.1/TDES-SCL-2
              o FCS_COP.1/AES-SCL-2
the respective dependencies FCS_CKM.1, FDP_ITC.1 or FDP_ITC.2 have to be fulfilled by the environment,
because the TOE does not provide the accompanying functionality; i.e. generate and import keys.
That means that the environment shall meet the requirements FCS_CKM.1, FDP_ITC.1 or FDP_ITC.2 as defined
in Common Criteria Part 2 [11], section 10.1 and 11.7.
The cryptographic key destruction can be done by overwriting the key register interfaces or by software reset of
the SCP which provides immediate zeroing of all SCP key registers. Please refer also to the application notes 41
and 42 in the PP [9].

Publi and data to a privilege
level model. The MMU controls the address permissions of up to seven privileged levels and gives the software
the possibility to define different access rights for the user available privileged levels. The address permissions of
the privilege levels are controlled by the MMU. In case of an access violation the MMU will trigger a reset and
then a trap service routine can react on the access violation. The policy of setting up the MMU and specifying the
memory ranges for the privilege levels – with the exception of the IFX level – is defined from the user software
(OS). The privilege levels 0, 1 and 2 are reserved for TOE internal operations. The privilege levels 3 and 4 are
reserved for operation systems and the privilege levels 5, 6 and 7 are reserved for applications.
Therefore, the TOE provides support for secure separation of memory areas covering the security functional
requirements FPT_PHP.3 “Resistance to physical attack”, FDP_ACC.1 “Subset access control”, FDP_ACF.1
“Security attribute based access control”, FMT_MSA.1 “Management of security attributes”, FMT_MSA.3 “Static
attribute initialization” and FMT_SMF.1 “Specification of Management functions”.

The TOE provides the possibility to protect the property rights of user code and data by the encryption of the
SOLID FLASH™ NVM areas with a specific key defined by the user. Due to this key management FDP_ACF.1 is
fulfilled. In addition, each memory present on the TOE is encrypted using either mask specific or chip individual
or even session keys, assigned by a complex key management. Induced errors are recognized by the Integrity
Guard concept and lead to an alarm with high feasibility. In case of security critical errors a security alarm is
generated and the TOE ends up in a secure state. The covered security functional requirements are FPT_PHP.3

8.5            SF_CS: Cryptographic Support
The TOE is equipped with several hardware accelerators and software modules to support the standard
symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic operations. This security function is introduced to include the
cryptographic operation in the scope of the evaluation as the cryptographic function respectively mathematic
algorithm itself is not used from the TOE security policy. On the other hand these functions are of special interest
for the use of the hardware as platform for the software. The components are a cryptographic co-processor
supporting the DES and AES algorithms and a combination of a co-processor and software library modules to
support RSA cryptography, RSA key generation, ECDSA signature generation and verification, ECDH key
agreement and EC public key calculation and public key testing.
Note that the additional function of the EC library, ECC_ADD providing the primitive elliptic curve operations,
does not add specific security functionality and that the according user guidance abbreviates the Elliptic Curve
cryptographic functions with ECC.

Note 17:
The symmetric cryptographic library SCL in two alternative versions is a delivery option. Therefore the TOE may
come with or without one of the SCLs. In the case of coming without any of the alternative SCLs, the TOE does
not provide the related AES and TDES security functional requirements. The equal case applies if the symmetric
cryptographic coprocessor is blocked. Then neither the SCL versions nor the SCP implement the related AES and
TDES security functional requirements. The SCL requires the presence of the SCP.
End of note.

Note 18:
Not used. Kept for consistency.

Note 19:
The cryptographic libraries RSA, EC and the Toolbox library are delivery options, regardless of the version
chosen. Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations of or even without these libraries. In the case of
coming without one or any combination of the cryptographic libraries RSA and EC, the TOE does not provide the

Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or Elliptic Curve
Cryptography (EC). The Toolbox Library is no cryptographic library, provides no additional specific security
functionality and thus the Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
End of note.

Note 20:
This TOE can come with both crypto co-processors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked
Crypto2304T, or with both crypto co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior
to the production of the hardware. In case the SCP is blocked, no AES and DES computation supported by
hardware is possible. In case the Crypto2304T is blocked, no RSA and EC computation supported by hardware is
possible. No accessibility of the deselected cryptographic co-processors is without impact on any other security
policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the situation where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic
co-processors.
End of note.

Note 21:
The presence of the alternative cryptographic library CIPURSE™ CL is a delivery option.
Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations with the other libraries of or without these libraries.
In the case of coming without the CIPURSE™ CL the TOE does not provide the specific security functionality
implemented by this software.

1.     Executive Summary
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is an Infineon Security Controller M7893 B11 with optional
Software Library RSA2048/4096 v2.03.008, EC v2.03.008, SHA-2 v1.01, SCL v2.02.010
libraries, and Toolbox v2.03.008, as well as with specific IC dedicated software (firmware).
The TOE provides a real 16-bit CPU-architecture and is compatible to the 80251
microcontroller architecture. The major components of the core system are the two CPUs
(Central Processing Units), acting as one, the MMU (Memory Management Unit) and MED
(Memory Encryption/Decryption Unit). The dual interface controller is able to communicate
using either the contact based or the contactless interface.
The TOE consists of the hardware part, the firmware parts and the software parts.
The software parts are differentiated into the cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, and SHA-2,
symmetric cryptographic libraries and the supporting libraries Toolbox and Base. The Base
Library does not provide any specific security functionality on its own. However it is a
necessary perquisite in order to use the RSA, EC and Toolbox libraries.
This TOE is intended to be used in smart cards and other form factors for particularly
security-relevant applications and for its prevalent use as developing platform for smart
card operating systems. The term Smartcard Embedded Software is used in the following
for all operating systems and applications stored and executed on the TOE. The TOE is
the platform for the Smartcard Embedded Software.
The Security Target [6] is the basis for this certification. It is based on the certified
Protection Profile Security IC Platform Protection Profile, Version 1.0, 15 June 2007, BSI-
CC-PP-0035-2007 [8]. The TOE Security Functional Requirements are implemented by
the following TOE Security Functionality:

                                     The life cycle of the TOE is split up into several
                                     phases. Different operation modes help to protect
                                     the TOE during each phase of its lifecycle.

                                     The TOE uses various means to protect from
                                     snooping of memories and busses and prevents

                                     This TOE implements protection against
                                     modifying attacks of memories, alarm lines and
                                     sensors.
  SF_PLA                             Protection against Logical Attacks:
                                     The memory access control of the TOE uses a
                                     memory management unit (MMU) to control the
                                     access to the available physical memory by using
                                     virtual memory addresses and to segregate the
                                     code and data to a privilege level model. The
                                     MMU controls the address permissions of up
                                     seven privileged levels and gives the software the
                                     possibility to define different access rights. The
                                     address permissions of the privilege levels are

                                       violation the MMU will trigger a reset and then a

  SF_CS                                Cryptographic Support:
                                       The TOE is equipped with several hardware
                                       accelerators and software modules to support the
                                       standard      symmetric     and       asymmetric
                                       cryptographic operations. The components are a
                                       coprocessor supporting the DES and AES
                                       algorithms and a combination of a coprocessor
                                       and software modules to support RSA
                                       cryptography, RSA key generation, ECDSA
                                       signature generation and verification, ECDH key
                                       agreement and EC public key calculation and
                                       public key testing. Furthermore, the TOE is
                                       equipped with an optional SHA-2 library and
                                       HASH module as well as well as an AIS31
                                       conformant TRNG that meets the functionality
                                       class PTG.2. In addition the optional Symmetric
                                       library (SCL) provides a high-level interface to
                                       3DES and AES symmetric cryptographic
                                       operation implemented on the symmetric
                                       hardware coprocessor.

                                     Table 2: Deliverables of the TOE

The delivery documentation describes all procedures that are necessary to maintain
security when distributing versions of the TOE or parts of it to the user’s site including the
necessary intermediate delivery procedures.
Furthermore, the delivery documentation describes in a sufficient manner how the various
procedures and technical measures provide for the detection of modifications and any
discrepancies between the TOE respective parts of it send by the TOE Manufacturer and
the version received by the Composite Product Manufacturer.
Three different delivery procedures have to be taken into consideration:
    ●   Delivery of the IC dedicated software components (IC dedicated SW, guidance)
        from the TOE Manufacturer to the IC Embedded Software Developer.
    ●   Delivery of the IC Embedded Software (ROM / Flash data, initialisation and pre-
        personalisation data) from the IC Embedded Software Developer to the TOE
        Manufacturer.
    ●   Delivery of the final TOE from the TOE Manufacturer to the Composite Product
        Manufacturer. After phase 3 the TOE is delivered in form of wafers or sawn wafers,
        after phase 4 in form of modules (with or without inlay antenna).
Respective distribution centers are listed in Appendix B (see below).
The individual TOE hardware is uniquely identified by its identification data. The
identification data contains the lot number, the wafer number and the coordinates of the
chip on the wafer. Each individual TOE can therefore be traced unambiguously and thus
assigned to the entire development and production process.
The hardware part of the TOE is identified by M7893 B11. Another characteristic of the
TOE are the chip identification data. These chip identification data is accessible via the
Generic Chip Identification Mode (GCIM) see [16] chapter 7.10.3.
The firmware part of the TOE is also identified also via the GCIM for all of the firmware
parts.




                                                                                                    14 / 33
BSI-DSZ-CC-0879-V4-2020                                                       Certification Report




The SCL (optional), RSA (optional), EC (optional), SHA-2 (optional), Toolbox (optional),
and Base library (optional), as separate software parts of the TOE, are also identified by
their unique version numbers. The user can identify these versions by calculating the hash
signatures of the provided library files. The mapping of these hash signatures to the
version numbers is provided in the Security Target [6] and [9] section 10.
For further, detailed information regarding TOE identification see [9], section 1.2.
Please also note, that as the TOE is under control of the user software, the TOE
Manufacturer can only guarantee the integrity up to the delivery procedure. It is in the
responsibility of the Composite Product Manufacturer to include mechanisms in the
implemented software (developed by the IC Embedded Software Developer) which allows
detection of modifications after the delivery.

3.       Security Policy
The Security Policy is expressed by the set of Security Functional Requirements and
implemented by the TOE. It covers the following issues:
Symmetric cryptographic block cipher algorithms (Triple-DES and AES), to ensure the
confidentiality of plain text data by encryption and to support secure authentication
protocols and it will provide a random number generation of appropriate quality.
The RSA library is used to provide a high level interface to RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman)
cryptography implemented on the hardware component Crypto2304T and includes
countermeasures against SPA, DPA and DFA attacks. The EC library is used to provide a
high level interface to Elliptic Curve cryptography implemented on the hardware
component Crypto2304T and includes countermeasures against SPA, DPA and DFA
attacks. The SHA-library provides the calculation of a hash value of freely chosen data
input in the CPU.
As the TOE is a hardware security platform, the security policy of the TOE is also to
provide protection against leakage of information (e.g. to ensure the confidentiality of
cryptographic keys during AES, Triple-DES, RSA and EC cryptographic functions
performed by the TOE), against physical probing, against malfunctions, against physical
manipulations and against abuse of functionality.
Hence the TOE shall
     ●   maintain the integrity and the confidentiality of data stored in the memory of the
         TOE and
     ●   maintain the integrity, the correct operation and the confidentiality of security
         functionalities (security mechanisms and associated functions) provided by the
         TOE.

4.       Assumptions and Clarification of Scope
The Assumptions defined in the Security Target and some aspects of Threats and
Organisational Security Policies are not covered by the TOE itself. These aspects lead to
specific security objectives to be fulfilled by the TOE-Environment. The following topics are
of relevance: OE.Plat-Appl (Usage of Hardware Platform), OE.Resp-Appl (Treatment of
User Data) and OE.Process-Sec-IC (Protection during Composite product manufacturing).

5.       Architectural Information
The TOE is an integrated circuit (IC) providing a platform for an operating sytem and
application software used in smartcards but also in any other device or form factor
requiring a high level of resistance against attackers. A top level block diagram and a list of
subsystems can be found within the TOE description of the Security Target [6], chapter
2.1.
The TOE consists of a core system, memories, computing peripherals, system peripherals,
standard peripherals, an analogue module and the connecting busses. The major
components of the core system are the double CPU (Central Processing Units) including
the internal encryption leaving no plain data, the MMU (Memory Management Unit) and
MED (Memory Encryption/Decryption Unit). The Block diagram provides a simplified
overview upon the hardware subsystems in the Security Target [6] and [9], figure 1.
The symmetric co-processor (SCP) combines both AES and Triple-DES with dual-key or
triple-key hardware acceleration. The Asymmetric Crypto Co-processor is called
Crypto2304T and provides hardware support for asymmetric algorithms like RSA and EC.
The software part of the TOE consists of the cryptographic RSA-, EC-, SCL- and the SHA-
2 libraries and the supporting Toolbox and Base libraries. If RSA or EC or Toolbox or
combinations hereof are part of the shipment, automatically the Base Library of the same
version is included.

6.       Documentation
The evaluated documentation as outlined in table 2 is being provided with the product to
the customer. This documentation contains the required information for secure usage of
the TOE in accordance with the Security Target.
Additional obligations and notes for secure usage of the TOE as outlined in chapter 10 of
this report have to be followed.

7.       IT Product Testing
The developer performed five categories of tests:
     ●   Simulation Tests (design verification): The simulation tests are carried out in the
         course of the development of the TOE during the IC design phase. They verify that
         the designed circuits satisfy the specifications.
     ●   Qualification Tests: For each mask version a qualification test is performed. Via the
         results of these tests a qualification report is generated. The positive result of the
         qualification is one part of the necessary testing results documented with the
         qualification report. The qualification report is completed after the verification testing
         (see below) and the security evaluation (see below) are performed successfully.
         The tests performed and their results are listed in the qualification report. The
         results of the tests are the basis on which it is decided, whether the TOE is released
         to production.
     ●   Verification Tests: With these tests in user mode the functionality of the end user
         environment is checked.
     ●   Security Evaluation Tests: In the context of security evaluation testing the security
         mechanisms is tested again in the user mode only focusing on security. Here is not



                                                                                             16 / 33
BSI-DSZ-CC-0879-V4-2020                                                       Certification Report




         only verified that the security functionality is working as this was already tested on
         every single TOE during production, but also it is tested how well the security
         functionality is working and the effectiveness is calculated. This step is necessary
         as the mechanisms work together and that must be evaluated in the user mode.
     ●   Production Tests: Before delivery on every chip production tests are performed.
         These tests use the CRC checksums attained by the simulation tests. The aim of
         these tests is to check whether each chip is functioning correctly.
The developer tests cover all security functionalities and all security mechanisms as
identified in the functional specification.
The evaluators were able to repeat the tests of the developer either using the library of
programs, tools and prepared chip samples delivered to the evaluator or at the developers
site. They performed independent tests to supplement, augment and to verify the tests
performed by the developer. The tests of the developer were repeated by sampling, by
repetition of complete regression tests and by software routines developed by the
evaluators and computed on samples with an evaluation operating system. For the
developer tests repeated by the evaluators other test parameters were used and the test
equipment was varied. Security features of the TOE realised by specific design and layout
measures were checked by the evaluators during layout inspections both in design data
and on the final product.
The evaluation has shown that the actual version of the TOE provides the security
functionalities as specified by the developer. The test results confirm the correct
implementation of the TOE security functionalities.
For penetration testing the evaluators took all security functionalities into consideration.
Intensive penetration testing was planned based on the analysis results and performed for
the underlying mechanisms of security functionalities using bespoke equipment and expert
know how. The penetration tests considered both the physical tampering of the TOE and
attacks which do not modify the TOE physically. The penetration tests results confirm that
the TOE is resistant to attackers with high attack potential in the intended environment for
the TOE.

8.       Evaluated Configuration
This certification covers the following configurations of the TOE:
     ●   Smartcard IC M7893 B11.
Depending on the blocking configuration, a M7893 product can have a different user
available configuration as described in Security Target Lite [6], chapter 1.1. The M7893
B11 allows for a maximum of configuration possibilities defined by the customer order
following the market needs. For example, a M7893 B11 product can come in one project
with the fully available ROM and SOLID FLASH™ Non Volatile Memory (NVM) or in
another project without any user available ROM and with any other SOLID FLASH™ NVM-
size below the physical implementation size, or with a different RAM size. Even more, the
user has the free choice, whether he needs the symmetric co-processor SCP, or the
asymmetric co-processor Crypto2304T, or both, or none of them. In addition, the user
decides, whether the TOE comes with a combination of software libraries or without any.
And, to be even more flexible, various interface options can be chosen as well.




                                                                                           17 / 33

9.        Results of the Evaluation
9.1.       CC specific results
The Evaluation Technical Report (ETR) [7] was provided by the ITSEF according to the
Common Criteria [1], the Methodology [2], the requirements of the Scheme [3] and all
interpretations and guidelines of the Scheme (AIS) [4] as relevant for the TOE.
The Evaluation Methodology CEM [2] was used for those components up to EAL 5
extended by advice of the Certification Body for components beyond EAL 5 and guidance
specific for the technology of the product [4] (AIS 34).
The following guidance specific for the technology was used:
(i)        The Application of CC to Integrated Circuits,
(ii)       The Application of Attack Potential to Smartcards,
(iii)      Functionality classes and evaluation methodology of physical random number
           generators,
(see [4] e.g., AIS 25, AIS 26 and AIS 31).
For RNG assessment the scheme interpretations AIS xx was used (see [4]).
To support composite evaluations according to AIS 36 the document ETR for composite
evaluation [10] was provided and approved. This document provides details of this
platform evaluation that have to be considered in the course of a composite evaluation on
top.
The assurance refinements outlined in the Security Target were followed in the course of
the evaluation of the TOE.
As a result of the evaluation the verdict PASS is confirmed for the following assurance
components:
●     All components of the EAL 6 package including the class ASE as defined in the CC (see
      also part C of this report)
●     The components ALC_FLR.1 augmented for this TOE evaluation.
As the evaluation work performed for this certification procedure was carried out as a re-
evaluation based on the certificate BSI-DSZ-CC-0879-V3-2018, re-use of specific
evaluation tasks was possible. The focus of this re-evaluation was on the removal of the
asymmetric cryptographic library (ACL) v1.03.006 and the updates of the user guidance.
The evaluation has confirmed:
●     PP Conformance:          Security IC Platform Protection Profile, Version 1.0, 15 June
                               2007, BSI-CC-PP-0035-2007 [8]
●     for the Functionality:   PP conformant plus product specific extensions
                               Common Criteria Part 2 extended
●     for the Assurance:       Common Criteria Part 3 conformant
                               EAL 6 augmented by ALC_FLR.1
For specific evaluation results regarding the development and production environment see
annex B in part D of this report.
The results of the evaluation are only applicable to the TOE as defined in chapter 2 and
the configuration as outlined in chapter 8 above.


                                                                                           18 / 33

9.2.   Results of cryptographic assessment
The strength of the cryptographic algorithms was not rated in the course of this certification
procedure (see BSIG Section 9, Para. 4, Clause 2). But cryptographic functionalities with a
security level of lower than 100 bits can no longer be regarded as secure without
considering the application context. Therefore, for these functionalities it shall be checked
whether the related crypto operations are appropriate for the intended system. Some
further hints and guidelines can be derived from the 'Technische Richtlinie BSI TR-02102'
(https://www.bsi.bund.de).
The table in annex C of part D of this report gives an overview of the cryptographic
functionalities inside the TOE to enforce the security policy and outlines its rating from
cryptographic point of view. Any Cryptographic Functionality that is marked in column
'Security Level above 100 Bits' of the table of annex C of part D with 'no' achieves a
security level of lower than 100 Bits (in general context) only.

For the Cryptographic Functionality

●    CryptoGeneratePrimeMask(), which might be used in conjunction with RSA Key
Generation in ACL v2.03.008,

no statement on the respective cryptographic strength can be given.

Conformance evaluation and assessment to claimed cryptographic functionality standards
is documented in the confidential report “Cryptographic Standards Compliance
Verification” [22]. For a list of standards see annex C of part D.

The Flash Loader's cryptographic strength was also not assessed by BSI. However, the
evaluation according to the TOE's Evaluation Assurance Level did not reveal any
implementation weaknesses.

Please note, that this holds true also for those algorithms, where no cryptographic 100-Bit-
Level assessment was given. Consequently, the targeted Evaluation Assurance Level has
been achieved for those functionalities as well.


10. Obligations and Notes for the Usage of the TOE
The documents as outlined in table 2 contain necessary information about the usage of the
TOE and all security hints therein have to be considered. In addition all aspects of
Assumptions, Threats and OSPs as outlined in the Security Target not covered by the TOE
itself need to be fulfilled by the operational environment of the TOE.
The customer or user of the product shall consider the results of the certification within his
system risk management process. In order for the evolution of attack methods and
techniques to be covered, he should define the period of time until a re-assessment of the
TOE is required and thus requested from the sponsor of the certificate.
The limited validity for the usage of cryptographic algorithms as outlined in chapter 9 has
to be considered by the user and his system risk management process, too.
Some security measures are partly implemented in this certified TOE, but require
additional configuration or control or measures to be implemented by a product layer on
top, e.g. the [Auswahl im Einzelfall: IC Dedicated Support Software and/or Embedded
Software] using the TOE. For this reason the TOE includes guidance documentation (see


                                                                                          19 / 33

table 2) which contains obligations and guidelines for the developer of the product layer on
top on how to securely use this certified TOE and which measures have to be
implemented in order to fulfil the security requirements of the Security Target of the TOE.
In the course of the evaluation of the composite product or system it must be examined if
the required measures have been correctly and effectively implemented by the product
layer on top. Additionally, the evaluation of the composite product or system must also
consider the evaluation results as outlined in the document "ETR for composite evaluation"
[10].
    ●   The TOE is delivered to the Composite Product Manufacturer and to the Security IC
        Embedded Software Developer. The actual end-consumer obtains the TOE from the
        Composite Product Issuer together with the application, which runs on the TOE.
The Security IC Embedded Software Developer receives all necessary recommendations
and hints to develop his software in form of the delivered documentation.
    ●   All security hints described in the delivered documents [12] - [21], especially the
        recommendations for secure usage in [20] and [16, section 2.11] have to be
        considered.
The Composite Product Manufacturer receives all necessary recommendations and hints
to develop his software in form of the delivered documentation.
    ●   All security hints described in [21] have to be considered.
In addition the following hints resulting from the evaluation of the ALC evaluation aspect
has to be considered:
    ●   The Security IC Embedded Software Developer can deliver his software either to
        Infineon to let them implement it in the TOE (in Flash memory or ROM) or to the
        Composite Product Manufacturer to let him download the software in the Flash
        memory.
    ●   The delivery procedure from the Security IC Embedded Software Developer to the
        Composite Product Manufacturer is not part of this evaluation and a secure delivery
        is required.

11.     Security Target
For the purpose of publishing, the Security Target [9] of the Target of Evaluation (TOE) is
provided within a separate document as Annex A of this report. It is a sanitised version of
the complete Security Target [6] used for the evaluation performed. Sanitisation was
performed according to the rules as outlined in the relevant CCRA policy (see AIS 35 [4]).

8.5.6          CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library
The order option CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CCL) provides cryptographic functionality to implement a
CIPURSE™ V2 conformant protocol [35-1].
This protocol provides a secure mutual authentication of two entities, namely the terminal (denoted as PCD =
Proximity Coupling Device (CIPURSE™-compliant terminal)) and a smart card or a token in other form factors
which is called PICC. PICC stands for Proximity Integrated Circuit Card (CIPURSE™-compliant card).
Beside the mutual authentication, the protocol implements cryptographic measures to maintain the integrity of
the transferred data and preserves in parallel the confidentiality of the transferred data.

The CIPURSE™ CL covers the following cryptographic security functional requirements as follows:
CCL in version v02.00.0004
    FCS_CKM.1/CCLCryptographic key generation,
    FCS_CKM.4/CCLCryptographic key destruction – AES
    FCS_COP.1/CCLCryptographic Operation – CCL Trusted Channel

                     The implemented cryptographic operation applies following standards:
       Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 197 [31]
       NIST Special Publication SP 800-38A [21]
       CIPURSE™ V2 Cryptographic Protocol [35-1] chapter 5.2 Session key Derivation
       CIPURSE™ V2 Cryptographic Protocol [35-1] chapter 6.2 Key Derivation for the first frame
       CIPURSE™ V2 Cryptographic Protocol [35-1] chapter 6.3 Integrity Protection
       CIPURSE™ V2 Cryptographic Protocol [35-1] chapter 6.4 Confidential Communication


8.5.7          Hybrid PTRNG
Random data is essential for cryptography as well as for security mechanisms. The TOE is equipped with a Hybrid
Physical True Random Number Generator (HPTRNG, FCS_RNG.1). The random data can be used from the
Smartcard Embedded Software and is also used from the security features of the TOE, i.e. masking. The
HPTRNG implements various topological means, masked bus interface and is self-checking.
The produced genuine random numbers are available as a security service for the user and are also used for
internal purposes. Together with the security guidelines in [6] the hybrid PTRNG operates in the following modes
of operation and is conformant to the named classes:
     True Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.2
     Hybrid Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.3
     Deterministic Random Number Generation (DRNG) AIS31 DRG.3
     Key Stream Generation (KSG), stream cipher generation AIS31 DRG.2

The details of AIS31 are given in [13].

The Hybrid PTRNG implements protected a protected peripheral bus interface is a synthesized module and
covers therefore FPT_PHP.3 “Resistance to physical attack”. The transferred random data are masked as well as
other configuration data transferred over the peripheral bus. This covers FDP_ITT.1 “Basic internal transfer
protection” and FPT_ITT.1 “Basic internal TSF data transfer protection”. The correct function of the Hybrid
PTRNG is subject of internal self-testing and in case of errors a secure state is achieved to protect the user from
random data with bad entropy. Therefore, the output of the Hybrid PTRNG is conformant to the above claimed
classes or there is no random data output. This covers FPT_FLS.1 “Failure with preservation of secure state”.

  7             Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)

  7.1           TOE Security Functional Requirements
 The security functional requirements (SFR) for this TOE are defined in this chapter.
This ST covers the three PPs [PP_SAC], [PP_EAC] and [PP_BAC] each two of which have a non empty
intersection of SFRs. In the rest of this section we provide a classification of the SFRs of these PPs depending on
where these SFRs are declared and if they need a refinement here in this ST.
 Table 1 lists all SFRs appearing both in [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC].
 Table 2 lists all SFRs declared in [PP_SAC].
Table 3 lists all SFRs specific to [PP_BAC]. Note that some of the SFRs appear in both [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC]
with same name but different content. In such cases the SFR is iterated with either the extension …/BAC or
…/PACE.
Table 4 lists all SFRs specific to [PP_EAC]. Note that [PP_EAC] is an extension of [PP_SAC], therefore all SFRs of
[PP_SAC] are SFRs in [PP_EAC], i.e. the SFRs listed in Table 3 and Table 4 are also SFRs of [PP_EAC].
Table 5 lists the SFRs introduced in this ST which are related to the Active Authentication mechanism
supported by the TOE.

7.1.1                About the Application Notes in this ST
Note that if an SFR has application notes as per the PPs [PP_SAC], [PP_EAC] and [PP_BAC] then these
application notes apply and can be found in the respective PPs.
Some SFRs contain additional application notes to ease the understanding of the specificities of this TOE.
These application notes do not come from the PPs and are prefixed with [IFX specific].

 Application Note:         notes. While the application note from [PP_BAC] simply requests the encryption
                           and message authentication keys to be destroyed, the application note from
                           [PP_SAC] provides more detailed requests, when the session keys have to be
                           destroyed. Therefore FCS_CKM.4 from [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC] can be combined.

                          used for the PACE, BAC and the authentication mechanism based on Triple-DES (as
                          defined in FIA_UAU.4/PACE and FIA_UAU.4).

 FPT_TST.1.1              The TSF shall run a suite of self tests during initial start-up, to demonstrate the

 [IFX specific]           There is no contradiction between application note 46 of [PP_BAC] and application
                          note 52 of [PP_SAC]. In fact, although the wording is slightly different, the meaning
 Application Note:
                          of these application notes is identical. Therefore either of these application notes
                          applies and FPT_TST.1 from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be combined.

                1.4.2.3     Post Delivery Configuration
                          Post Delivery Configuration (PDC) can be applied by the customer himself after the TOE
                          has been delivered to that customer. These options can be used to tailor the TOE to the
                          specific customer requirements. The Post Delivery Configuration can be changed multiple
                          times but must be set permanently by the customer before the TOE is delivered to phase 7
                          of the life cycle.
                          The Post Delivery Configuration for the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF is listed in Table
                          9.

                          By applying Post Delivery Configuration the Security Rows content is updated for the

                          and identification of the TOE after applying Post Delivery Configuration refer to [9].

                          commercial types are named according to the following format.
                            • P60D024ypp(p)/9Brrff(o) for major configuration P60D024PVB(Y/Z/A)/MVB(Y/Z/A)
                            • P60D016ypp(p)/9Brrff(o) for major configuration P60D016PVB(Y/Z/A)/MVB(Y/Z/A)
                            • P60D012ypp(p)/9Brrff(o) for major configuration P60D012PVB(Y/Z/A)/MVB(Y/Z/A)
                            • P60D024ypp(p)/9Frrff(o) for major configuration P60D024yVF
                            • P60D016ypp(p)/9Frrff(o) for major configuration P60D016yVF
                            • P60D012ypp(p)/9Frrff(o) for major configuration P60D012yVF
                          The commercial type name of each major configuration varies with the package type as
                          indicated by the variable pp and with the Security IC Embedded Software as indicated by
                          the variables rr and ff. Variable y identifies the activation of the firmware emulations.
                          Variable o identifies the EEPROM size of MIFARE Software. The number 9 is used as Fab
                          identifier and B/F references to the silicon version also available at major configuration
                          naming as VB/VF. The variables are replaced according to the rules in Table 10.

                           Variable         Definition
                           y                     Emulation Option Configuration for Dual Interface Types (alpha numeric), e.g.
                                                 ‘M’ for MIFARE Plus.
                           pp(p)                 Package delivery type (alpha numeric, last character optional), e.g. “A4” for
                                                 MOB4 module.
                           rr                    ROM code number, which identifies the ROM mask.

                       Table 11 depicts the package types, which are supported in this Security Target, and
                       assigns these to the major configurations. The two characters in each entry of the table
                       stand for the variable pp, and identify the package type. An empty cell means that the
                       Security Target does not support the respective package type for the corresponding major
                       configuration.

                                                                    identifies the module type)

                                                                    type and the package type inside the inlay.)


                       For example, commercial type name P60D024PX0/9Brrff denotes major configuration
                       P60D024yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF in PDM1.1 dual interface smart card module. The characters ‘rr’
                       and ‘ff’ are individual for each customer product.
                       The package types do not influence the security functionality of the TOE. They only define
                       which pads are connected in the package and for what purpose and in which environment
                       the chip can be used. Note that the security of the TOE is not dependent on which pad is
                       connected or not - the connections just define how the product can be used. If the TOE is
                       delivered as wafer the customer can choose the connections on his own.
                       Security during development and production is ensured for all package types listed above,
                       for details refer to section 1.4.4.
                       The commercial type name identifies major configuration and package type of the TOE as
                       well as the Security IC Embedded Software. However, the commercial type name does not
                       itemize the minor configuration options of the TOE, which are introduced in section 1.4.2.2.
                       Instead, minor configuration options are identified in the Order Entry Form, which is
                       assigned to the ROM code number and the FabKey number of the commercial type name.

                  1.4.3 Logical Scope of TOE
                1.4.3.1     Hardware Description
                          The CPU of the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF supports a 32-/24-/16-/8-bit instruction
                          set and distinguishes five CPU modes, which are summarized in Table 12.

                          Table 12.    CPU modes of the TOE
                                            Super System Mode
                           Boot Mode            Test Mode                            Firmware Mode                     System Mode        User Mode

                          Boot Mode, Test Mode and Firmware Mode are sub-modes of the so-called Super System
                          Mode. These three modes are not available to the Security IC Embedded Software; they
                          are reserved for the Security IC Dedicated Software. The Security IC Dedicated Software is
                          composed of Security IC Dedicated Test Software and Security IC Dedicated Support
                          Software, (Boot-ROM Software and Firmware Operating System) as introduced in section
                          1.4.1. The three software components are mapped one-to-one to the three CPU modes: In
                          Boot Mode the TOE executes the Boot-ROM Software, in Test Mode the TOE executes the
                          IC Dedicated Test Software and in Firmware Mode the TOE executes the Firmware
                          Operating System. Please note that the Super System Mode is not a mode on its own:
                          When the TOE is in Super System Mode, it is always either in Boot Mode, Test Mode or
                          Firmware Mode.
                          The P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF is able to control two different logical phases. After
                          production of the Security IC every start-up or reset completes with Test Mode and
                          execution of the IC Dedicated Test Software. The Test Mode is disabled at the end of the
                          production test. Afterwards, every start-up or reset ends up in System Mode and execution
                          of the Security IC Embedded Software.
                          In case the minor configuration option ‘Post Delivery Configuration’ is enabled and not finally
                          locked by the customer, the resource configuration functionality allows the customer to
                          enable or disable specific functionality of the hardware platform, refer to Table 9.
                          In case the minor configuration option ‘Chip Health/Ident Mode’ is enabled, during the boot
                          process routines either starting built-in self tests checking the functional integrity of the TOE
                          or sending back identification items of the TOE can be activated by the user.
                          System Mode and User Mode are available to the developer of the Security IC Embedded
                          Software. System Mode has unlimited access to the hardware components available to the
                          Security IC Embedded Software. User Mode has restricted access to the CPU, specific
                          Special Function Registers and the memories depending on the access rights granted by
                          software running in System Mode. The hardware components are controlled by the Security
                          IC Embedded Software via Special Function Registers. Special Function Registers are
                          interrelated to the activities of the CPU, the Memory Management Unit, interrupt control, I/O
                          configuration, EEPROM, timers, UART, the contactless interface and the coprocessors.

NXP Semiconductors                                            P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF
                                                                                                                    Security Target Lite



                       The P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF provides two types of interrupts: (i) exception
                       interrupts, called “exception” in the following and (ii) event interrupts, called “interrupts” in
                       the following. Exceptions and interrupts each force a jump to a specific fixed vector address
                       in the ROM. Any exception and interrupt can therefore be controlled and guided by a specific
                       part     of     the    Security     IC     Embedded       Software.      In     addition,    the
                       P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF provides eight firmware vectors (FVEC) and 32 system
                       call vectors (SVEC). These vectors have to be explicitly called by the Security IC Embedded
                       Software. A jump to a firmware vector forces Firmware Mode and starts execution of the
                       Firmware Operating System, a jump to a system call vector forces System Mode.
                       The Watchdog timer is intended to abort irregular program executions by a time-out
                       mechanism and is enabled and configured by the Security IC Embedded Software.
                       The P60D024yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF incorporates 352 kBytes of ROM, 8.125 kBytes of RAM and

and against download of malicious software before, during and after the user downloads his software. This is
formalized with the objectives O.Cap_Avail_Loader, O.Authentication and O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader requiring
authentication of the TOE to external entities and a trusted communication channel. The O.Authentication
implements a mutual authentication and involves the environment therefore.
And the policies cover also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must be
regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.
The implemented mutual authentication requires first to authenticate the TOE to the external user. This requires
also knowledge by the user about the sequence of the protocol, interpretation of the transferred data and how to
start the authentication of the TOE. This authentication mean counters the threat T.Masquerade_TOE as only
the genuine TOE is able to identify itself correctly to the enabled user, which covers O.Authentication.
The second step of the mutual authentications mean implements the authentication of the user to the TOE. Only
the user enabled to present the correct authentication data and knowing about the sequence, data
interpretation and signaling of the authentication to the TOE is able to proceed further on.
This enforces OE.TOE_Auth, requiring the support of the verification mechanism and known authentication
reference data by the operational environment.

It is normal business that products enabled for software download by the user are either on their way to the user
or are already stored at user premises. At both situations it cannot be excluded that an attacker could manage to
steal such products enabled for software downloads. The ability to download software on a chip without
operating system and/or application is defined as open sample.
This situation generates the threat T.Open_Samples_Diffusion which is defined as follows:
The download of analysis software could enable an attacker to characterize the product and to construct an
attack path out of the gained information.
This threat is countered by the Flash Loader by following rational:
As long as the Flash Loader is active, controlled usage to the Flash Loader functionality (P.Ctrl_Loader) is
enforced which protects the TOE from achieving the status of being an open sample. And more, even the
attacker could observe, meaning in the sense of measurements during, or induce faults during an authorized
download, the Flash Loader protects the user data of the download by confidentiality and integrity protection
means. The Flash Loader functionalities of mutual authentication, establishing a dedicated trusted
communication channel, the encryption and integrity protection means cover the objectives
O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality, O.Leak-Inherent and O.Leak-Forced.
The policy P.Ctrl_Loader covers also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1
