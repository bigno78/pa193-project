A.      Certification

1.      Preliminary Remarks
Under the BSIG1 Act, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) has the task of
issuing certificates for information technology products.
Certification of a product is carried out on the instigation of the vendor or a distributor,
hereinafter called the sponsor.
A part of the procedure is the technical examination (evaluation) of the product according
to the security criteria published by the BSI or generally recognised security criteria.
The evaluation is normally carried out by an evaluation facility recognised by the BSI or by
BSI itself.
The result of the certification procedure is the present Certification Report. This report
contains among others the certificate (summarised assessment) and the detailed
Certification Results.
The Certification Results contain the technical description of the security functionality of
the certified product, the details of the evaluation (strength and weaknesses) and
instructions for the user.

2.      Specifications of the Certification Procedure
The certification body conducts the procedure according to the criteria laid down in the
following:
‚óè   Act on the Federal Office for Information Security1
‚óè   BSI Certification and Approval Ordinance2
‚óè   BSI Schedule of Costs3
‚óè   Special decrees issued by the Bundesministerium des Innern (Federal Ministry of the

3.      Recognition Agreements
In order to avoid multiple certification of the same product in different countries a mutual
recognition of IT security certificates - as far as such certificates are based on ITSEC or
CC - under certain conditions was agreed.

3.1.    European Recognition of CC ‚Äì Certificates (SOGIS-MRA)
The SOGIS-Mutual Recognition Agreement (SOGIS-MRA) Version 3 became effective in
April 2010. It defines the recognition of certificates for IT-Products at a basic recognition
level and, in addition, at higher recognition levels for IT-Products related to certain SOGIS
Technical Domains only.
The basic recognition level includes Common Criteria (CC) Evaluation Assurance Levels
EAL 1 to EAL 4. For "Smartcards and similar devices" a SOGIS Technical Domain is in
place. For "HW Devices with Security Boxes" a SOGIS Technical Domains is in place, too.
In addition, certificates issued for Protection Profiles based on Common Criteria are part of
the recognition agreement.
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes, details on
recognition, and the history of the agreement can be seen on the website at
https://www.sogisportal.eu.
The SOGIS-MRA logo printed on the certificate indicates that it is recognised under the
terms of this agreement by the related bodies of the signatory nations. A disclaimer
beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of recognition.
This certificate is recognized under SOGIS-MRA for all assurance components selected.

3.2.    International Recognition of CC ‚Äì Certificates (CCRA)
The international arrangement on the mutual recognition of certificates based on the CC
(Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement, CCRA-2014) has been ratified on 08
September 2014. It covers CC certificates based on collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP)
(exact use), CC certificates based on assurance components up to and including EAL 2 or
the assurance family Flaw Remediation (ALC_FLR) and CC certificates for Protection
Profiles and for collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP).
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes can be seen on
the website: https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org.
The Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement logo printed on the certificate indicates
that this certification is recognised under the terms of this agreement by the related bodies
of the signatory nations. A disclaimer beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of
recognition.
This certificate is recognized according to the rules of CCRA-2014, i. e. up to and including
CC part 3 EAL 2+ ALC_FLR components.

4.      Performance of Evaluation and Certification
The certification body monitors each individual evaluation to ensure a uniform procedure, a
uniform interpretation of the criteria and uniform ratings.
The product NXP Secure Smart Card Controller N7021 VA including IC Dedicated
Software has undergone the certification procedure at BSI. This is a re-certification based
on BSI-DSZ-CC-0977-2017. Specific results from the evaluation process BSI-DSZ-CC-
0977-2017 were re-used.
The evaluation of the product NXP Secure Smart Card Controller N7021 VA including IC
Dedicated Software was conducted by T√úV Ihis certification procedure was carried out as a re-
evaluation based on the certificate BSI-DSZ-CC-0977-2017, re-use of specific evaluation
tasks was possible. The focus of this re-evaluation was on the life cycle and updates in the
documentation of the TOE.
The evaluation has confirmed:

9.2.     Results of cryptographic assessment
The strength of the cryptographic algorithms was not rated in the course of this certification
procedure (see BSIG Section 9, Para. 4, Clause 2). But cryptographic functionalities with a
security level of lower than 100 bits can no longer be regarded as secure without
considering the application context. Therefore, for these functionalities it shall be checked
whether the related crypto operations are appropriate for the intended system. Some
further hints and guidelines can be derived from the 'Technische Richtlinie BSI TR-02102'
(https://www.bsi.bund.de).
The following table gives an overview of the cryptographic functionalities inside the TOE to
enforce the security policy and outlines its rating from cryptographic point of view. Any
Cryptographic Functionality that is marked in column 'Security Level above 100 Bits' of the
following table with 'no' achieves a security level of lower than 100 Bits (in general context)
only.

1.3 TOE Overview
The Security Target (ST) defines the security objectives and requirements for a
contact or contactless based chip of machine readable travel documents (MRTD)
based on the requirements and recommendations of the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO), EU requirements for biometric European passport
(Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 and Commission Implementing Decision
6181) and Biometric European Resident Permit (REGULATION (EU) 2017/1954
and Commission Implementing Decision 6178). This product is intended to
enable verification of the authenticity of the travel document and to identify its
holder during a border control, using an inspection system. The verification
process is based on Extended Access Control with Password Authenticated
Connection Establishment (PACE) and optionally Active Authentication (AA).

The main features and their origin are the following:
ÔÇ∑ Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
   according to ICAO Technical Report ‚ÄúSupplemental Access Control‚Äù [ICAO-
   9303] part 11 and strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0068-V2 [PACE-PP] for
   protection of the communication between terminal and chip. The following
   PACE mapping modes are supported and covered by the TOE:
      o    Generic Mapping (PACE-GM)
      o    Integrated Mapping (PACE-IM)
      o    Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM), which combines PACE-GM
           with Chip Authentication into a single protocol.

ÔÇ∑   Chip Authentication v1
    according to BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1], [TR-03110-3] and
    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    travel document‚Äôs chip to the inspection system.
ÔÇ∑   Terminal Authentication v1
    according to BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1], [TR-03110-3] and
    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    inspection system to travel document‚Äôs chip and protects the confidentiality
    and integrity of the sensitive biometric reference data during their
    transmission from the TOE to the inspection system.

As a feature that can be optionally configured the TOE supports:
ÔÇ∑   Active Authentication
    which according to [ICAO-9303] prevents copying the SOD and proves that it
    has been read from the authentic chip. It proves that the chip has not been
    substituted.


ÔÇ∑   Polymorphic Authentication
    which according to [PCA-eMRTD] provides additional privacy by randomisation
    of returned Polymorphic Identities, Polymorphic Pseudonyms and
    Complementary Polymorphic ID attributes in combination with standard ICAO
    and EAC1 eMRTD protocols specified in ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] and BSI
    TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1] and [TR 03110-3].

The TOE may also be used as an ISO driving license, compliant to ISO/IEC 18013
or ISO/IEC TR 19446 supporting PACE, AA and CA, as both applications (MRTD
and IDL) share the same protocols and data structure organization. Therefore, in
the rest of the document, the word ‚ÄúMRTD‚Äù MAY be understood either as a MRTD
in the sense of ICAO, or a driving license compliant to ISO/IEC 18013 or ISO/IEC
TR 19446 depending on the targeted usage envisioned by the issuer.

Application note
This TOE claims an assurance level EAL5 augmented with AVA_VAN.5 and
ALC_DVS.2. AVA_VAN.5 implies that the TOE is resistant to attacks performed by
an attacker possessing "High attack potential".
Not all key sizes specified in this security target have sufficient cryptographic
strength for satisfying the AVA_VAN.5 ‚Äúhigh attack potential‚Äù. In order to be
protected against attackers with a "high attack potential", sufficiently large
cryptographic key sizes SHALL be configured for this TOE. References can be

[TR-03110] have also been refered to in ISO18013 for EU driving licences. The
BAP-1 protocol defined in ISO18013 is equal to Basic Access Protocol (BAC)
defined in [ICAO-9303]. As to the logical data structure, the ISO18013 uses the
same concept of Passive Authentication defined in [ICAO-9303], but specifies
different ISO7816-4 elementary file identifiers for storing the ICAO defined
content of DG3, DG4 and DG15.

When an Issuing state is using the product as an ISO compliant Driving licence,

use of TOE configured as respectively ICAO/EAC eMRTD/Driving licence and
Polymorphic eMRTD.


1.4.2.1 ICAO/EAC eMRTD and ISO Driving licence
This sub section explains the TOE security features for operational use of TOE
configured as ICAO/EAC eMRTD or as Driving Licence.

A State or Organisation issues travel documents to be used by the holder for
international travel. The traveller presents a travel document to the inspection
system to prove his or her identity. The travel document in context of this
Security Target contains:
  I.  visual (eye readable) biographical data and portrait of the holder,
 II.  a separate data summary (MRZ data) for visual and machine reading using
       OCR methods in the Machine readable zone (MRZ) and
III.  data elements on the travel document‚Äôs chip according to LDS in case of
       contactless machine reading.

The authentication of the traveller is based on:
  I.  the possession of a valid travel document personalized for a holder with
      the claimed identity as given on the biographical data page and
 II.  biometrics using the reference data stored in the travel document.

                              eMRTD Configuration)


The issuing State or Organization ensures the authenticity of the data of genuine
travel documents. The receiving State trusts a genuine travel document of an
issuing State or Organization.

For this Security Target the travel document is viewed as unit of:
(i) the physical part of the travel document in form of paper and/or plastic
    and chip. It presents visual readable data including (but not limited to)
    personal data of the travel document holder
    (a) the biographical data on the biographical data page of the travel
         document surface,
    (b) the printed data in the Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) and
    (c) the printed portrait.

(ii) the logical travel document as data of the travel document holder stored
     according to the Logical Data Structure as defined in [ICAO-9303] as specified
     by ICAO on the contact based or contactless integrated circuit. It presents
     contact based / contactless readable data including(but not limited to)
     personal data of the travel document holder
     (a) the digital Machine Readable Zone Data (digital MRZ data, EF.DG1),
     (b) the digitized portraits (EF.DG2),
     (c) the biometric reference data of finger(s) (EF.DG3) or iris image(s)
          (EF.DG4) or both1,
     (d) the other data according to LDS (EF.DG5 to EF.DG16) and
     (e) the Document Security Object (SOD).


The issuing State or Organisation implements security features of the travel
document to maintain the authenticity and integrity of the travel document and
their data. The physical part of the travel document and the travel document‚Äôs
chip are identified by the Document Number.

The physical part of the travel document is protected by physical security
measures (e.g. watermark, security printing), logical (e.g. authentication keys of
the travel document‚Äôs chip) and organisational security measures (e.g. control of
materials, personalisation procedures) [ICAO-9303].These security measures can
include the binding of the travel document‚Äôs chip to the travel document.

The logical travel document is protected in authenticity and integrity by a digital
signature created by the document signer acting for the issuing State or
Organisation and the security features of the travel document‚Äôs chip.

The ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] defines the baseline security methods Passive
Authentication, advanced security access methods Basic Access Control (BAC)
and Password Authenticated Connection Establishment to the logical travel



These biometric reference data are optional according to [ICAO-9303]. This ST assumes that the issuing State or
1

Organisation uses this option and protects these data by means of extended access control.

document, Active Authentication of the travel document‚Äôs chip, Extended Access
Control and the Data Encryption of sensitive biometrics as optional security
measure. The Passive Authentication Mechanism is performed completely and
independently of the TOE by the TOE environment.

The BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1] and [TR 03110-3] specify the
Extended Access Control protocols Chip Authentication version 1 (CAv1) and
Terminal Authentication (TAv1), which are required to get secured access to the
biometric data stored in data groups DG3 and DG4 in combination with PACE or
BAC.

This Security Target addresses the protection of the logical travel document:
   (i) in integrity by write-only-once access control and by physical means, and
   (ii) in confidentiality by the Extended Access Control Mechanism.

This Security Target addresses the Chip Authentication Version 1 described in
[TR-03110-1] and PACE-CAM described in [ICAO-9303] part 11 as an alternative
to the Active Authentication stated in [ICAO-9303].

For Basic Access Control (BAC) supported by the product, a separate evaluation
and certification is performed with ST [ST-BAC].

The confidentiality by Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
is a mandatory security feature of the TOE. The travel document shall strictly
conform to the ‚ÄòCommon Criteria Protection Profile Machine Readable Travel
Document using Standard Inspection Procedure with PACE [PACE-PP]. Note that
[PACE-PP] considers high attack potential.

For the PACE protocol according to [ICAO-9303] part 11, the following steps shall
be performed:
 (i) the travel document's chip encrypts a nonce with the shared password,
       derived from the MRZ resp. CAN data and transmits the encrypted nonce
       together with the domain parameters to the terminal.
 (ii) The terminal recovers the nonce using the shared password, by
       (physically) reading the MRZ or CAN data. This nonce shall be converted to
       a group generator using one of the following mapping algorithms, which
       maps a static generator to an ephemeral generator:
           a. Generic mapping (PACE-GM) or
           b. Integrated mapping PACE-IM)
 (iii) The travel document's chip and terminal computer perform a Diffie-
       Hellmann key agreement together with the ephemeral domain parameters
       to create a shared secret. Both parties derive the session keys KMAC and
       KENC from the shared secret.
 (iv) Each party generates an authentication token, sends it to the other party
       and verifies the received token.

In case of PACE with Chip Authenticated Mapping (PACE-CAM), in addition to the
steps above executed for the PACE-GM variant, the MRTD chip computes Chip
Authentication Data CAIC, encrypts them AIC = E(KSEnc, CAIC) and sends them

to the terminal. The terminal decrypts AIC and verifies the authenticity of the
chip using the recovered Chip Authentication Data CAIC.

After successful key negotiation, the terminal and the travel document's chip
provide private communication (secure messaging) [TR-03110-1], [ICAO-9303].

This Security Target requires the TOE to implement the Extended Access Control
as defined in [TR-03110-1]. The Extended Access Control consists of two parts:
  (i) the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1 and
  (ii) the Terminal Authentication Protocol Version 1 (v.1).

The Chip Authentication Protocol v.1
  (i) authenticates the travel document‚Äôs chip to the inspection system and
  (ii) establishes secure messaging which is used by Terminal Authentication v.1
       to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the sensitive biometric
       reference data during their transmission from the TOE to the inspection
       system. Therefore Terminal Authentication v.1 can only be performed if
       Chip Authentication v.1has been successfully executed.

The Terminal Authentication Protocolv.1 consists of
  (i) the authentication of the inspection system as entity authorized by the
       receiving State or Organisation through the issuing State, and
  (ii) an access control by the TOE to allow reading the sensitive biometric
       reference data only to successfully authenticated authorized inspection
       systems.

The Active Authentication protocol may be optionally configured during
personalisation.

The issuing State or Organisation authorizes the receiving State by means of
certification the authentication public keys of Document Verifiers who create
Inspection System Certificates.


1.4.2.2 Polymorphic eMRTD

In addition to an ICAO/EAC eMRTD functionality, the TOE supports Polymorphic
eMRTD extensions that can be configured using the same applet during
personalisation. The TOE‚Äôs Polymorphic eMRTD extensions enable secure
authentication with enhanced privacy protection features. The Polymorphic
extensions provide the holder the possibility to authenticate towards a service
provider using an authentication service in a non-traceable and non-linkable
manner thanks to usage of Polymorphic ID attributes.

The Polymorphic extensions are used to configure a Polymorphic eMRTD as stand
alone application instance or next to an ICAO/EAC eMRTD/Driving application
licence instance having its own application identifier during personalisation.

                        eMRTD Configuration)

The Polymorphic eMRTD uses the same ICAO and EAC1 protocols like PACEv2,
Chip Authentication v1 (CAv1) and Terminal Authentication (v1) as defined in
[ICAO-9303], [TR-03110-1] and [TR-03110-3]. The TOE‚Äôs Polymorphic eMRTD
extensions provide the following features:

   ÔÇ∑   Secure storage of the Polymorphic ID attributes during personalisation or
       the TOE.
   ÔÇ∑   Polymorphic Authentication Protocol (PMA) for authenticated access with
       user consent, randomization and secure readout of the Polymorphic ID
       attributes, in combination with PACEv2 and EAC1 eMRTD protocols.
   ÔÇ∑   PACEv2 protocol extended with PIN and PUK passwords, to enforce user
       authentication (document holder verification) in compliance with [TR-
       03101-3].

For Polymorphic eMRTD, the PACE protocol is configured with PIN, PUK and CAN
passwords in compliance with [TR-03110-3] during personalisation. Only PACE-
GM and PACE-IM are configurable for a Polymorphic eMRTD.

The Active Authentication protocol shall not be configured for a polymorphic
eMRTD.

The logical data structure consists only of EF.CVCA, DG14 and EF.SOD. In order
to assure a sufficient level of privacy during authentication the CAv1 private key
and EF.SOD are shared amoung a sufficient high number of personalised
Polymorphic eMRTDs, i.e. the logical data structure does not contain any unique
identifiable data.



1.4.3 TOE life cycle
The TOE life cycle is described in terms of its four life cycle phases. (With respect
to the [SIC-PP], the TOE life-cycle is additionally subdivided into 7 steps in the
ST. These steps are denoted too in the following although the sequence of the
steps differs for the TOE life cycle).

1.4.3.1 Phase 1 ‚ÄúDevelopment‚Äù
(Step1) The TOE is developed in phase 1. The IC developer develops the
integrated circuit, the IC Dedicated Software and the guidance documentation
associated with these TOE components.
The IC developer also acts as the developer of the embedded software (operating
system), which is the NXP JCOP 3 P60.

(Step2) The software developer uses the guidance documentation for the
integrated circuit and the guidance documentation for relevant parts of the NXP
JCOP 3 P60 and develops the ePassport application and the guidance
documentation associated with this TOE component.

The ePassport application (i.e. the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
(SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet run time code) may be
integrated either in ROM or in EEPROM of the chip. Depending on the intention:
      (a) the ePassport application is securely delivered directly from the
          software developer (IDEMIA development dept.) to the IC manufacturer
          (NXP). The applet code will be integrated into the ROM mask code or
          inEEPROM by the IC manufacturer, or
      (b) the ePassport application is securely delivered directly from the
          software developer (IDEMIA development dept.) to the travel document
          manufacturer (IDEMIA production dept.) .) for loading in EEPROM.

Notice that the guidance documentation of the ePassport application is always
securely delivered directly from the software developer (IDEMIA development
dept.) to the travel document manufacturer (IDEMIA production dept.).


1.4.3.2 Phase 2 ‚ÄúManufacturing‚Äù
(Step3) In a first step the TOE integrated circuit is produced containing the travel
document‚Äôs chip Dedicated Software, the parts of the travel document‚Äôs chip
Embedded Software and in case of alternative a) the ePassport application in
ROM or in EEPROM.

The IC manufacturer writes the IC Identification Data onto the chip to control the
IC as travel document material during the IC manufacturing and the delivery
process to the travel document manufacturer. The IC is securely delivered from
the IC manufacturer to the travel document manufacturer.

                           eMRTD Configuration)

If necessary the IC manufacturer adds the parts of the IC Embedded Software in
the non-volatile programmable memories (for instance EEPROM).

(Step4 optional) The travel document manufacturer combines the IC with
hardware for the contact based / contactless interface in the travel document
unless the travel document consist of the chip only.

(Step5) The travel document manufacturer
  i.  adds the IC Embedded Software or part of it in the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM) if necessary and in case
      of alternative (b), loads the ePassport application into the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM),
 ii.      creates the ePassport application and
iii.      equips travel document‚Äôs chips with pre-personalization Data.

EAC PP Application Note 1: Creation of the application for this TOE implies
Applet instantiation.

For this Security Target the following name mappings to the protection profile
[EAC-PP-V2] apply:
   ÔÇ∑ IC Dedicated SW = Low level IC libraries
   ÔÇ∑ travel document‚Äôs chip Embedded Software = NXP JCOP 3 P60 operating
       system.
   ÔÇ∑ ePassport application = IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
       (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet run time code or an
       instantiation of it.
   ÔÇ∑ Pre-personalization Data = Personalization Agent Key Set, Card Production
       Life Cycle (CPLC) data and buffer settings.

Both the underlying platform and IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
(SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet provide configuration and
life-cycle management functions required for TOE preparation. TOE preparation
steps are performed in manufacturing phase and consist of the following 2
activities:
    1. Platform initialisation
       2. Pre-personalisation

Platform initialisation
Platform initialisation consists of the configuration of the NXP JCOP 3 P60 in
accordance with requirements specified in the platform administrator guidance
[PLTF-PRE] by using the dedicated platform commands. Furthermore the Pre-
Personalisation Agent key set is installed and (a part of) the CPLC data is
updated. To prevent unattended tracing of the MRTD document, the NXP JCOP 3
P60 is configured such that unauthenticated access to any platform unique
idenfiable data is not possible.

                              eMRTD Configuration)

Pre-personalisation
The pre-personalisation consists of the following steps:
   a. IC (chip) Authentication and getting chip access with the pre-
      personalisation key set.
   b. [optional] In case the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
      (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet runtime code does
      not reside in ROM, it is loaded into EEPROM.
   c. Install the applet application instances depending on the desired TOE
      configuration specified in section 1.4.2, using IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with
      Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet.
   d. Set the ePassport (and if present) the Polymorphic eMRTD applet
      irreversibly in its PERSONALISATION life-cycle state by installation of the
      Personalisation Agent specific personalisation key set(s).

During step (c) the CPLC data with the IC Identifier as well as the other pre-
personalisation data is configured in the TOE. The last step (d) finalizes the TOE.
This is the moment the TOE starts to exist and is ready for delivery to the
Personalisation Agent. The guidance documentation for the Personalisation Agent
is [AGD_PRE].

The pre-personalised travel document together with the IC Identifier is securely
delivered from the travel document manufacturer to the Personalisation Agent.
The travel document manufacturer also provides the relevant parts of the
guidance documentation [AGD_PRE] and [AGD_OPE] and the Personalisation
Agent Key set to the Personalisation Agent. The following table describes the
physical delivery of the TOE components:

1.4.3.3 Phase 3 ‚ÄúPersonalisation of the travel document‚Äù
(Step 6) The personalisation of the travel document includes
  i.  the survey of the MRTD holder‚Äôs biographical data,
 ii.   the enrolment of the MRTD holder biometric reference data (i.e. the
       digitized portraits and the optional biometric reference data),
iii.   the printing of the visual readable data onto the physical MRTD,
iv.    the writing of the TOE User Data and TSF Data into the logical MRTD and
 v.    configuration of the TSF if necessary.

The step (iv) is performed by the Personalisation Agent and includes but is not
limited to the creation of:
  i.   the digital MRZ data (EF.DG1),
 ii.   the digitized portrait (EF.DG2), and
iii.   the Document security object.

The signing of the Document security object by the Document signer [ICAO-
9303] finalizes the personalisation of the genuine travel document for the travel
document holder. The personalised travel document (together with appropriate
guidance (AGD_OPE) for TOE usage if necessary) is handed over to the travel
document holder for operational use.

The personalisation of Polymorphic eMRTD application instance includes:

 i.    establishing the identity of the polymorphic eMRTD document holder,
 ii.   Requesting the required Polymorphic eMRTD ID attributes from the central
       Key Management authority,
iii.   writing Polymorphic ID attributes, Polymorphic LDS data as defined in
       [PCA-eMRTD],
iv.    writing the TSF data (PIN, PUK, CAv1 private key) as defined in [PCA-
       eMRTD],
 v.    signing the Document Security Object defined in
       [ICAO-9303] (in the role of DS).


The signing of the Document security object by the Document signer [ICAO-
9303] finalizes the personalisation of the genuine Polymorphic eMRTD document
for the travel document holder. The personalised Polymorphic eMRTD document
(together with appropriate guidance (AGD_OPE) for TOE usage if necessary) is
handed over to the Polymorphic eMRTD document holder for operational use.

Authentication trust anchor, the effective date and the Chip Authentication
Private Key.

EAC PP Application note 3: This ST distinguishes between the Personalisation
Agent as entity known to the TOE and the Document Signer as entity in the TOE
IT environment signing the Document security object as described in [ICAO-
9303]. This approach allows but does not enforce the separation of these roles.


1.4.3.4 Phase 4 ‚ÄúOperational Use‚Äù
(Step 7) The TOE is used as a travel document's chip by the traveller and the
inspection systems in the ‚ÄúOperational Use‚Äù phase. The user data can be read
according to the security policy of the issuing State or Organisation and can be
used according to the security policy of the issuing State but they can never be
modified.

EAC PP Application note 42: The intention of the ST is to consider at least the
phases 1 and parts of phase 2 (i.e. Step1 to Step3) as part of the evaluation and
therefore to define the TOE delivery according to CC after this phase. Since
specific production steps of phase 2 are of minor security relevance (e.g. booklet
manufacturing and antenna integration) these are not part of the CC evaluation
under ALC. Nevertheless the decision about this has to be taken by the
certification body resp. the national body of the issuing State or Organisation. In
this case the national body of the issuing State or Organisation is responsible for
these specific production steps.
Note that the personalisation process and its environment may depend on
specific security needs of an issuing State or Organisation. All production,
generation and installation procedures after TOE delivery up to the ‚ÄúOperational
Use‚Äù (phase 4) have to be considered in the product evaluation process under
AGD assurance class. Therefore, the Security Target outlines the split up of
P.Manufact, P.Personalisation and the related security objectives into aspects
relevant before vs. after TOE delivery.


1.4.3.5 Non-TOE hardware/software/firmware required by the TOE
There is no explicit non-TOE hardware, software or firmware required by the TOE
to perform its claimed security features. The TOE is defined to comprise the chip
and the complete operating system and application. Note, the inlay holding the
chip as well as the antenna and the booklet (holding the printed MRZ) are
needed to represent a complete travel document. Nevertheless, these parts are
not inevitable for the secure operation of the TOE.




2
 For this ST all steps of both phase 1 and phase 2 are part of the evaluation and therefore define the TOE
delivery according to the CC evaluation after this phase.

2.3 Package Claim
This ST is conforming to assurance package EAL5 augmented with ALC_DVS.2
and AVA_VAN.5 defined in CC part 3 [CC-3].


2.4 PP Conformance Rationale
This ST claims strict conformance to [EAC-PP-V2]. According to hints in [EAC-PP-
V2] parts of the [PACE-PP] have been included into this ST. A detailed
justification is given in the following.


2.4.1 Main aspects
-   The TOE description (chapter 1.3) is based on the TOE definition and TOE
    usage of [EAC-PP, 1.1]. It was enhanced by product specific details.

-   All definitions of the security problem definition in [EAC-PP, 3] have been
    taken exactly from the protection profile in the same wording.

-   All security objectives have been taken exactly from [EAC-PP, 4] in the same
    wording, except for OT.Chip_Auth_Proof which is enhanced to support
    Active Authentication.

-   The part of extended components definition has been taken originally from
    [EAC-PP, 5].

-   All SFRs for the TOE have been taken originally from the [EAC-PP, 6.1] added
    by according iterations, selections and assignments.

-   The security assurance requirements (SARs) have been taken originally from
    the EAC-PP. The requirements are shifted to those of EAL 5+.


2.4.2 Overview of differences between the PP and the ST

The Active Authentication has been added to the TOE. For that:
- One assumption has been added to cover Active Authentication during
   personalization: A.Pers_Agent_AA
- Two security objectives for the environment have been added:
   OE.Auth_Key_MRTD and OE.AA_MRTD. These additions to the original
   objectives of the PP do not contradict with any other objective nor mitigate a
   threat (or part of a threat) meant to be addressed by security objectives for
   the TOE in the PP.
- Three security functional requirements have been added:
             ÔÇ∑ FCS_COP.1/SIG_GEN
             ÔÇ∑   FIA_API.1/AA
             ÔÇ∑   FMT_MTD.1/AAPK

                  IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy
                                                                2018_2000036361

                        eMRTD Configuration)

The additional functionality of Password Authenticated Connection Establishment
with Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM) has been added to the TOE. It
possesses the same security requirements as the PACE functionality, which
means that the same security problem definition is applicable for PACE-CAM.


The following additional SFRs have been defined for PACE-CAM:
             ÔÇ∑ FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM
             ÔÇ∑   FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM
             ÔÇ∑   FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM
             ÔÇ∑   FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM
             ÔÇ∑   FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM
             ÔÇ∑   FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ
             ÔÇ∑   FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_WRITE




The additional functionality of the Polymorphic eMRTD extensions has been
added to the TOE with: (i) additional security problem definition; (ii) additional
security objectives; (iii) additional SFRs. Notice that many SFRs are included
from the [EACv2-PP].

  Application Note:
  This asset is an extension of the asset 'user data transferred between the TOE
  and the terminal connected' defined in [PACE-PP] and [EAC-PP-V2]. As for
  confidentiality, note that even though not each transferred data element
  represents a secret, [TR-03110-2] requires confidentiality of all transferred
  data by secure messaging, employing the encrypt-then-authenticate

  functional operation.
  Threat agent: having high attack potential, being in possession of one or more
  legitimate travel documents, having information about the functional operation
  Asset: integrity and authenticity of the travel document, availability of the
  functionality of the travel document, confidentiality of User Data and TSF-data
  of the travel document.




3.3.2 Additional Threats

T.Read_Sensitive_Data
  Read the sensitive biometric reference data
  Adverse action: An attacker tries to gain the sensitive biometric reference data
  through the communication interface of the travel document‚Äôs chip.
  The attack T.Read_Sensitive_Data is similar to the threat T.Skimming (cf.
  [PP_BAC]) in respect of the attack path (communication interface) and the
  motivation (to get data stored on the travel document‚Äôs chip) but differs from
  those in the asset under the attack (sensitive biometric reference data vs.
  digital MRZ, digitized portrait and other data), the opportunity (i.e. knowing
  the PACE Password) and therefore the possible attack methods. Note, that the
  sensitive biometric reference data are stored only on the travel document‚Äôs
  chip as private sensitive personal data whereas the MRZ data and the portrait
  are visually readable on the physical part of the travel document as well.
  Threat agent: having high attack potential, knowing the PACE Password, being
  in possession of a legitimate travel document.
  Asset: confidentiality of logical travel document sensitive user data (i.e.
  biometric reference)

T.Counterfeit
  Counterfeit of travel document chip data
  Adverse action: An attacker with high attack potential produces an

10. Obligations and Notes for the Usage of the TOE
The documents as outlined in table 2 contain necessary information about the usage of the
TOE and all security hints therein have to be considered. In addition all aspects of
Assumptions, Threats and OSPs as outlined in the Security Target not covered by the TOE
itself need to be fulfilled by the operational environment of the TOE.
The customer or user of the product shall consider the results of the certification within his
system risk management process. In order for the evolution of attack methods and
techniques to be covered, he should define the period of time until a re-assessment of the
TOE is required and thus requested from the sponsor of the certificate.
The limited validity for the usage of cryptographic algorithms as outlined in chapter 9 has
to be considered by the user and his system risk management process, too.


                                                                                                     22 / 32

Some security measures are partly implemented in this certified TOE, but require
additional configuration or control or measures to be implemented by a product layer on
top, e.g. the IC Dedicated Support Software and/or Embedded Software] using the TOE.
For this reason the TOE includes guidance documentation (see table 2) which contains
obligations and guidelines for the developer of the product layer on top on how to securely
use this certified TOE and which measures have to be implemented in order to fulfil the
security requirements of the Security Target of the TOE. In the course of the evaluation of
the composite product or system it must be examined if the required measures have been
correctly and effectively implemented by the product layer on top. Additionally, the
evaluation of the composite product or system must also consider the evaluation results as
outlined in the document "ETR for composite evaluation" [10].
At the point in time when evaluation and certification results are reused there might be an
update of the document "ETR for composite evaluation" available. Therefore, the certified
products list on the BSI website has to be checked for latest information on
reassessments, recertifications or maintenance result available for the product.

11.     Security Target
For the purpose of publishing, the Security Target [9] of the Target of Evaluation (TOE) is
provided within a separate document as Annex A of this report. It is a sanitised version of
the complete Security Target [6] used for the evaluation performed. Sanitisation was
performed according to the rules as outlined in the relevant CCRA policy (see AIS 35 [4]).

3.5 Assumptions
The assumptions describe the security aspects of the environment in which the
TOE will be used or is intended to be used.

3.5.1 Assumptions listed in PP PACE

A.Passive_Auth
  PKI for Passive Authentication The issuing and receiving States or
  Organisations establish a public key infrastructure for passive authentication
  i.e. digital signature creation and verification for the logical travel document.
  The issuing State or Organisation runs a Certification Authority (CA) which
  securely generates, stores and uses the Country Signing CA Key pair. The CA
  keeps the Country Signing CA Private Key secret and is recommended to
  distribute the Country Signing CA Public Key to ICAO, all receiving States
  maintaining its integrity. The Document Signer (i) generates the Document
  Signer Key Pair,(ii) hands over the Document Signer Public Key to the CA for
  certification, (iii) keeps the Document Signer Private Key secret and (iv) uses
  securely the Document Signer Private Key for signing the Document Security
  Objects of the travel documents. The CA creates the Document Signer
  Certificates for the Document Signer Public Keys that are distributed to the
  receiving States and Organisations. It is assumed that the Personalisation
  Agent ensures that the Document Security Object contains only the hash
  values of genuine user data according to [ICAO-9303].



3.5.2 Assumptions listed in PP EAC

A.Insp_Sys
  Inspection Systems for global interoperability The Extended Inspection
  System (EIS) for global interoperability includes the Country Signing CA Public
  Key and implements the terminal part of PACE [ICAO-9303] part 11 and/or
  BAC [BAC-PP]. BAC may only be used if supported by the TOE. If both PACE
  and BAC are supported by the TOE and the IS, PACE must be used. The EIS
  reads the logical travel document under PACE or BAC and performs the Chip
  Authentication v.1 to verify the logical travel document and establishes secure
  messaging. EIS supports the Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 in order to
  ensure access control and is authorized by the issuing State or Organisation

                                                                     Ref.:
                  IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy
                                                               2018_2000036361
                  Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic
                                                                 Page: 46/150
                        eMRTD Configuration)

  through the Document Verifier of the receiving State to read the sensitive
  biometric reference data.
  Justification: The assumption A.Insp_Sys does not confine the security
  objectives of the [PACE-PP] as it repeats the requirements of P.Terminal and
  adds only assumptions for the Inspection Systems for handling the EAC
  functionality of the TOE.

A.Auth_PKI
  PKI for Inspection Systems The issuing and receiving States or
  Organisations establish a public key infrastructure for card verifiable
  certificates of the Extended Access Control. The Country Verifying Certification
  Authorities, the Document Verifier and Extended Inspection Systems hold
  authentication key pairs and certificates for their public keys encoding the
  access control rights. The Country Verifying Certification Authorities of the
  issuing States or Organisations are signing the certificates of the Document
  Verifier and the Document Verifiers are signing the certificates of the Extended
  Inspection Systems of the receiving States or Organisations. The issuing
  States or Organisations distribute the public keys of their Country Verifying
  Certification Authority to their travel document‚Äôs chip.
  Justification: This assumption only concerns the EAC part of the TOE. The
  issuing and use of card verifiable certificates of the Extended Access Control is
  neither relevant for the PACE part of the TOE nor will the security objectives of
  the [PACE-PP] be restricted by this assumption. For the EAC functionality of
  the TOE the assumption is necessary because it covers the pre-requisite for
  performing the Terminal Authentication Protocol Version 1.



3.5.3 Assumptions related to Active Authentication

A.Pers_Agent_AA
     Personalization of the MRTD‚Äôs chip (Active Authentication) The
     Personalization Agent ensures the correctness of the Active Authentication
     Public Key (EF.DG15) if stored on the MRTD‚Äôs chip.


3.5.4 Assumptions related to Polymorphic eMRTD
The table below provides a mapping giving the Assumptions related to the
polymorphic eMRTD and Assumptions from PACE PP [PACE-PP] and EACv1 PP

A.Polymorphic_Auth

A.Polymorphic_Auth
  It assumed that:
      o All authentication infrastructure keys used by the central Key
          Management       Authority     for   the    polymorphic    authentication
          infrastructure (generation and transformation of PP, PI and CPI) are
          generated, handled and stored securely.
      o The PP/PI/CPI are generated securely by the central Key Management
          Authority of the polymorphic authentication infrastructure and stored
          securely in the eMRTD polymorphic chip during the personalization
          phase.
      o The TOE communicates only with Trustworthy Authentication
          Service/Terminal during the Polymorphic Authentication.
      o The randomised PP, PI and CPI are securely received by Polymorphic
          Authentication Service/Terminal. The randomised PP, PI and CPI are
          transformed (‚Äúre-keyed‚Äù) by the central Key Management Authority
          (i.e. ElGamal re-encryption of the randomized PP, PI and/or CPI using
          the public key of Service Provider, who has is authorized to read the
          plain value of identifying user attributes included in the PP, PI or CPI).
          Identification by the identifying user attributes contained inside the PP,
          PI and CPI takes place at the Service Provider.
  Application Note:
  This Assumption has been added to this ST for the polymorphic authentication
  infrastructure. This addition does not conflict with the strict conformance to
  PACE PP [PACE-PP] and EACv1 PP [EAC-PP-V2].

A.Auth_PKI_Polymorphic
  PKI for Polymorphic eMRTD It is assumed that:
     o The issuing States or Organisations establish a dedicated CVCA, DVCA
        and IS PKI for the polymorphic eMRTD infrastructure.
     o The Country Verifying Certification Authorities, the Document Verifier
        and Extended Inspection Systems hold authentication key pairs and
        certificates for their public keys encoding the access control rights for
        access to the PP, PI and (optional) CPI polymorphic user data. The
        Country Verifying Certification Authorities of the issuing States or
        Organisations are signing the certificates of the Document Verifier and
        the Document Verifiers are signing the certificates of the Polymorphic
        Authentication     Terminal/Service   of   the   receiving   States    or
        Organisations. The issuing States or Organisations distribute the public

      o The issuing State or Organisation establishs the necessary public key
         infrastructure in order to limit the access to Polymorphic data of
         Polymorphic eMRTD document holders to authorized Organisations. The
         Country Verifying Certification Authority of the issuing State or
         Organisation generates card verifiable Document Verifier Certificates
         for the authorized Document Verifier only.
      o The issuing State or Organisation establishs the necessary public key
         infrastructure in order to (i) generate the Polymorphic eMRTD
         document's Chip Authentication Key Pair, (ii) sign and store the Chip
         Authentication Public Key in the Chip Authentication Public Key data

      o The Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer establishes a public key
         infrastructure for the card verifiable certificates used for Terminal
         Authentication. For this aim, the Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer
         shall run a Country Verifying Certification Authority. The PKI shall fulfill
         the requirements and rules of the corresponding certificate policy. The
         Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer shall make the CVCA certificate
         available to the personalization agent or the manufacturer.
      o The polymorphic eMRTD document Issuer issues the polymorphic
         eMRTD document and approves it using the terminals and
         authentication services complying with all applicable laws and
         regulations.
  Application Note:
  This Assumption is an extension of the Assumption 'A.Auth_PKI' defined in
  [EAC-PP-V2]. For the EAC functionality of the TOE the assumption is necessary
  because it covers the pre-requisite for performing the Terminal Authentication
  Protocol Version 1.

A.Insp_Sys_Polymorphic

Polymorphic Inspection Systems and authentication services
     o Polymorphic    Inspection     Systems   (Polymorphic     Authentication
       Terminals/Services) ensure the confidentiality, Privacy, Authenticity

       verify its authenticity by means of the physical security measures and
       to detect any manipulation of the physical part of the polymorphic
       eMRTD document.
    o Polymorphic Inspection Systems include the Country Signing CA Public
       Key and implement the respective terminal part of the protocols
       required to execute PACE with PIN, Passive Authentication (PA), CAv1,
       TAv1 authentication according to [TR-03110-2] and Polymorphic
       Authentication (PMA). They are assumed to securely store static IS
       private keys and generate secure temporary session keys and nonces.
    o The Document Verifier authorizes Polymorphic Inspection Systems by
       creation of Inspection System Certificates for access to polymorphic
       user data stored the polymorphic eMRTD document. An Polymorphic
       Inspection Systems authenticates itselve to the polymorphic eMRTD
       document's chip for getting access to the polymorphic data with its
       private Terminal Authentication key and corresponding Inspection
       System Certificate.
Application Note:
This Assumption is an extension of the Assumption 'A.Insp_Sys' defined in
[EAC-PP-V2]. For the EAC functionality of the TOE the assumption is necessary
because it covers the pre-requisite for performing the PACE with PIN, CAv1
and TAv1 authentication.

  The issuing State or Organisation has to establish the necessary public key
  infrastructure in order to limit the access to sensitive biometric reference data
  of travel document holders to authorized receiving States or Organisations.
  The Country Verifying Certification Authority of the issuing State or
  Organisation generates card verifiable Document Verifier Certificates for the
  authorized Document Verifier only.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Read_Sensitive_Data, the Organisational Security Policy P.Sensitive_Data
  and the Assumption A.Auth_PKI as it specifies the pre-requisite for the
  Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 as it concerns the need of an PKI for this
  protocol and the responsibilities of its root instance. The Terminal
  Authentication Protocol v.1 is one of the additional features of the TOE
  described only in [EAC-PP-V2] and not in [PACE-PP].

4.2.2 Travel document Issuer and CSCA: travel document PKI
(issuing) branch
The travel document Issuer and the related CSCA will implement the following
security objectives for the TOE environment:


OE.Passive_Auth_Sign
  Authentication of travel document by Signature.
  The travel document Issuer has to establish the necessary public key
  infrastructure as follows: the CSCA acting on behalf and according to the
  policy of the travel document Issuer must
      (i) generate a cryptographically secure CSCA Key Pair,
      (ii) ensure the secrecy of the CSCA Private Key and sign Document Signer
          Certificates in a secure operational environment, and

      (iii) publish the Certificate of the CSCA Public Key (CCSCA). Hereby
          authenticity and integrity of these certificates are being maintained.
  A Document Signer acting in accordance with the CSCA policy must
      (i) generate a cryptographically secure Document Signing Key Pair,
      (ii) ensure the secrecy of the Document Signer Private Key,
      (iii) hand over the Document Signer Public Key to the CSCA for
          certification,
      (iv) sign Document Security Objects of genuine travel documents in a
          secure operational environment only.
  The digital signature in the Document Security Object relates to all hash
  values for each data group in use according to [ICAO-9303].The
  Personalisation Agent has to ensure that the Document Security Object
  contains only the hash values of genuine user data according to [ICAO-9303].
  The CSCA must issue its certificates exclusively to the rightful organisations
  (DS) and DSs must sign exclusively correct Document Security Objects to be
  stored on travel document.

OE.Personalisation
  Personalisation of travel document
  The travel document Issuer must ensure that the Personalisation Agents
  acting on his behalf
      (i) establish the correct identity of the travel document holder and create
          the biographical data for the travel document,
      (ii) enroll the biometric reference data of the travel document holder,
      (iii) write a subset of these data on the physical Passport (optical
          personalisation) and store them in the travel document (electronic
          personalisation) for the travel document holder as defined in [ICAO-
          9303],
      (iv) write the document details data,
      (v) write the initial TSF data,
      (vi) sign the Document Security Object defined in [ICAO-9303] (in the role
          of a DS).

4.2.3 Terminal operator: Terminal receiving branch

OE.Terminal
  Terminal operating
  The terminal operators must operate their terminals as follows:
     1.) The related terminals (basic inspection systems, cf. above) are used by
        terminal operators and by travel document holders as defined in [ICAO-
        9303].
     2.) The related terminals implement the terminal parts of the PACE
        protocol [ICAO-9303] part 11, of the Passive Authentication [ICAO-

      4.) The related terminals securely store the Country Signing Public Key
         and the Document Signer Public Key (in form of CCSCA and CDS) in
         order to enable and to perform Passive Authentication of the travel
         document (determination of the authenticity of data groups stored in
         the travel document, [ICAO-9303] part 12).
      5.) The related terminals and their environment must ensure
         confidentiality and integrity of respective data handled by them (e.g.
         confidentiality of the PACE passwords, integrity of PKI certificates, etc.),
         where it is necessary for a secure operation of the TOE according to the
         current PP.

4.2.4 Travel document holder Obligations

OE.Travel_Document_Holder
  Travel document holder Obligations
  The travel document holder may reveal, if necessary, his or her verification
  values of the PACE password to an authorized person or device who definitely
  act according to respective regulations and are trustworthy.

4.2.5 Receiving State or Organisation

OE.Exam_Travel_Document
  Examination of the physical part of the travel document
  The inspection system of the receiving State or Organisation must examine
  the travel document presented by the traveler to verify its authenticity by
  means of the physical security measures and to detect any manipulation of the
  physical part of the travel document. The Basic Inspection System for global
  interoperability (i) includes the Country Signing CA Public Key and the
  Document Signer Public Key of each issuing State or Organisation, and (ii)
  implements the terminal part of PACE [ICAO-9303] part 11 and/or the Basic
  Access Control [ICAO-9303]. Extended Inspection Systems perform
  additionally to these points the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1 to verify
  the Authenticity of the presented travel document‚Äôs chip.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Counterfeit and the Assumption A.Insp_Sys by demanding the Inspection
  System       to     perform     the     Chip     Authentication     protocolv.1.
  OE.Exam_Travel_Document also repeats partly the requirements from
  OE.Terminal in [PACE-PP] and therefore also counters T.Forgery and A.
  Passive_Auth from [PACE-PP]. This is done because a new type of Inspection
  System is introduced in this PP as the Extended Inspection System is needed

      to handle the additional features of a travel document with Extended Access
      Control.


OE.AA_MRTD
      Active Authentication - Inspection Systems5
      An Active Authentication (Basic, General or Extended) Inspection system
      performs all the functions of the Basic, General and Extended Inspection
      System, and verifies the IC authenticity with an RSA or ECDSA signature
      generated by the MRTD (if available).



OE.Prot_Logical_Travel_Document
  Protection of data from the logical travel document
  The inspection system of the receiving State or Organisation ensures the
  confidentiality and integrity of the data read from the logical travel document.
  The inspection system will prevent eavesdropping to their communication with
  the TOE before secure messaging is successfully established based on the Chip
  Authentication Protocol Version 1.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP]in order to handle the Assumption
  A.Insp_Sys by requiring the Inspection System to perform secure messaging
  based on the Chip Authentication Protocol v.1.

OE.Ext_Insp_Systems
  Authorization of Extended Inspection Systems
  The Document Verifier of receiving States or Organisations authorizes
  Extended Inspection Systems by creation of Inspection System Certificates for
  access to sensitive biometric reference data of the logical travel document.
  The Extended Inspection System authenticates themselves to the travel
  document‚Äôs chip for access to the sensitive biometric reference data with its
  private Terminal Authentication Key and its Inspection System Certificate.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Read_Sensitive_Data, the Organisational Security Policy P.Sensitive_Data
  and the Assumption A. Auth_PKI as it specifies the pre-requisite for the
  Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 as it concerns the responsibilities of the
  Document Verifier and the Inspection Systems.

OE.Insp_Sys_Polymorphic
  Polymorphic Inspection Systems and authentication services
      o Polymorphic inspection systems (Terminals) or authentication services
         must ensure the confidentiality, privacy, authenticity and integrity of
         the user cerdentials (PIN, PUK, CAN) and the polymorphic data read
         from the polymorphic eMRTD document (integrity of trusted certificate
         store with PKI CSCA and CVCA, DVCA certificates, randomized PI, PP
         and optional CPI polymorphic user data, etc.), where it is necessary for
         a secure operation of the TOE.
      o The inspection system (Terminal/Authentication service) must prevent
         eavesdropping to their communication with the TOE before secure
         messaging is successfully established based on the Chip Authentication
         Protocol Version 1.
      o Inspection Systems that intent to be Polymorphic Authentication
         Terminals/Services must include the Country Signing CA Public Key and
         must implement the respective terminal part of the protocols required
         to execute the Passive Authentication, PACE with PIN, CAv1 and TAv1
         according to [TR-03110] and the Polymorphic Authentication protocol
         (PMA), and store (static keys) or generate (temporary keys and
         nonces) the corresponding credentials.
      o The Document Verifier must authorize Polymorphic Inspection Systems
         by creation of Inspection System Certificates for access to polymorphic
         data of the polymorphic eMRTD document. Polymorphic inspection
         systems must authenticate themselves to the polymorphic eMRTD
         document's chip for access to the polymorphic data with its private
         Terminal Authentication Key and its Inspection System Certificate.

4.3 Security Objectives Rationale

4.3.1 Threats

4.3.1.1 Threats listed in PP PACE

T.Skimming addresses accessing the User Data (stored on the TOE or
  transferred between the TOE and the terminal) using the TOE's
  contactless/contact interface. This threat is countered by the security
  objectives        OT.Data_Integrity,        OT.Data_Authenticity        and
  OT.Data_Confidentiality through the PACE authentication. The objective
  OE.Travel_Document_Holder ensures that a PACE session can only be
  established either by the travel document holder itself or by an authorised
  person or device, and, hence, cannot be captured by an attacker.

T.Eavesdropping addresses listening to the communication between the TOE
  and a rightful terminal in order to gain the User Data transferred there. This
  threat is countered by the security objective OT.Data_Confidentiality through a
  trusted channel based on the PACE authentication.

T.Tracing addresses gathering TOE tracing data identifying it remotely by
  establishing or listening to a communication via the contactless/contact
  interface of the TOE, whereby the attacker does not a priori know the correct
  values of the PACE password. This threat is directly countered by security
  objectives    OT.Tracing   (no    gathering   TOE     tracing    data)   and
  OE.Travel_Document_Holder (the attacker does not a priori know the correct
  values of the shared passwords).

T.Forgery 'Forgery of data' addresses the fraudulent, complete or partial
  alteration of the User Data or/and TSF-data stored on the TOE or/and
  exchanged between the TOE and the terminal. Additionally to the security
  objectives from PACE PP [PACE-PP] which counter this threat, the examination

  measures and detect any manipulation of the physical part of the travel

  The threat T.Forgery also addresses the fraudulent, complete or partial
  alteration of the User Data or/and TSF-data stored on the TOE or/and

                       eMRTD Configuration)

  exchanged between the TOE and the terminal. The security objective
  OT.AC_Pers requires the TOE to limit the write access for the travel document
  to the trustworthy Personalisation Agent (cf. OE.Personalisation). The TOE will
  protect the integrity and authenticity of the stored and exchanged User Data
  or/and TSF-data as aimed by the security objectives OT.Data_Integrity and
  OT.Data_Authenticity, respectively. The objectives OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper and
  OT.Prot_Abuse-Func contribute to protecting integrity of the User Data or/and
  TSF-data stored on the TOE. A terminal operator operating his terminals
  according to OE.Terminal and performing the Passive Authentication using the
  Document Security Object as aimed by OE.Passive_Auth_Sign will be able to
  effectively verify integrity and authenticity of the data received from the TOE.

T.Abuse-Func addresses attacks of misusing TOE's functionality to manipulate
  or to disclosure the stored User- or TSF-data as well as to disable or to bypass
  the soft-coded security functionality. The security objective OT.Prot_Abuse-
  Func ensures that the usage of functions having not to be used in the
  operational phase is effectively prevented.

T.Information_Leakage is typical for integrated circuits like smart cards under
  direct attack with high attack potential. The protection of the TOE against this
  threat is obviously addressed by the directly related security objective
  OT.Prot_Inf_Leak.

T.Phys-Tamper is typical for integrated circuits like smart cards under direct
  attack with high attack potential. The protection of the TOE against this threat
  is obviously addressed by the directly related security objective OT.Prot_Phys-
  Tamper.

T.Malfunction is typical for integrated circuits like smart cards under direct
  attack with high attack potential. The protection of the TOE against this threat
  is obviously addressed by the directly related security objective
  OT.Prot_Malfunction.

4.3.1.2 Additional Threats

T.Read_Sensitive_Data The threat T.Read_Sensitive_Data 'Read the sensitive
  biometric    reference   data'    is  countered     by    the   TOE-objective
  OT.Sens_Data_Conf 'Confidentiality of sensitive biometric reference data'
  requiring that read access to EF.DG3 and EF.DG4 (containing the sensitive
  biometric reference data) is only granted to authorized inspection systems.
  Furthermore it is required that the transmission of these data ensures the
  data's confidentiality. The authorization bases on Document Verifier
  certificates issued by the issuing State or Organisation as required by
  OE.Authoriz_Sens_Data 'Authorization for use of sensitive bie Access / resource
