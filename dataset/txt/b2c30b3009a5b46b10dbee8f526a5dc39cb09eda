                                            Tab. 1.1: Components of the TOE

The IC Hardware is delivered to the customer by secure transport in parcels sealed with special tape. The
customer can examine the tape sealing to make sure that the TOE has not been manipulated during transport.
The documentation can be downloaded by the customer from the NXP DocStore website after registration. Library
files (object files, header files and linker scripts) are also made available to the customer via NXP DocStore, as
part of a downloadable and installable SDK.
The logical dependencies of the TOE components are given in Section 1.4.3.2.
The IC Hardware is identified by a nameplate that is located in the layout of the chip (see [24] how to inspect the
nameplate). The IC Dedicated Software is identified by ’IC Dedicated Software version’, which can be read out by
the Security IC Embedded Software via a GetVersion command as described in [14].

1.4.2     Evaluated Configurations
The N7021 VA can be delivered with various configuration options as described in this section. The configu-
ration options are divided into two groups: major configuration options according to section 1.4.2.1 and minor
configuration options according to section 1.4.2.2.

1.4.2.1   Major configuration options
Three major configurations can be chosen by the customer during the ordering process:

Regardless of the minor configuration options selected, the TOE will always remain in a certified configuration.

1.4.2.3       Post Delivery Configuration
Post Delivery Configuration (PDC) can be used by the customer after the TOE has been delivered by NXP. These
options can be used to tailor the TOE to specific customer requirements. The Post Delivery Configuration settings
can be changed multiple times but must be set permanently by the customer before the TOE is delivered to phase
7 of the life-cycle.


    1 MIFARE   emulations are not part of the TSF and are therefore not in scope of this certification.

Table 1.3 lists those configuration parameters that can be set by PDC in the NXP Secure Smart Card Controller
N7021 VA.

     PDC option                             Description
     Total requested Flash size             Define the total number of customer available Flash pages. PDC can only re-
                                            duce this value.
     Contact/contactless/dual operation     Define the operation mode which can be either "contact only", "contactless
     mode                                   only", or "dual". Interfaces can only be deactivated by PDC if they were se-
                                            lected during ordering.
     Disable cryptographic functions        Define the available cryptographic options. Each of the three functions (DES,
                                            AES, PKCC) can be independently disabled.
     Outside Anti-Wear partition size       Defines the outside anti-wear partition flash size available for logical card B.
     Card B
     Inside Anti-Wear partition size Card   Defines the inside anti-wear partition flash page size of logical card B and the
     B and Free Page Pool (FPP) size        number of additional Free Page Pool pages. Wear-levelling increases Flash
                                            endurance.
     Default logical card                   Define which logical card SM (A or B) should be launched after finishing the
                                            boot sequence.
     Default OS                             Define which operating system (either OS 1 or OS 2) should be launched after
                                            finishing the boot sequence of the selected logical card.
     Card A/Card B RAM partition split      Define how the RAM is split between Card A and Card B.
     Basic control setting and codebase     Set the codebase (memory offset) and options for OS1 in Card B.
     for OS1 in Card B
     Basic control setting and codebase     Set the codebase (memory offset) and options for OS2 in Card B.

                                             Tab. 1.3: Post Delivery Configuration

As indicated in the description of the PDC options, they can only be used to downgrade some configurations,
it is not possible to enable functionality. The Post Delivery Configuration can be accessed using chip health
mode functionality in combination with the ISO/IEC 7816 contact interface. PDC configures the availability of
TSF. Deactivating TSF is identical to not utilizing the functionality and therefore the TOE will remain in a certified
configuration. For further details regarding PDC refer to [21].

1.4.2.4     Dependencies on minor configuration and PDC
Depending on the minor configuration options chosen during the ordering process, and on the changes made
using PDC, some of the security functionality mentioned in this ST is no longer available. Table 1.4 below lists
these dependencies.

                                            Tab. 1.6: Supported Package Types

Security during development and production is ensured for all package types listed above, for details refer to
section 1.4.4.
The commercial type name identifies major configuration and package type of the TOE as well as the Security
IC Embedded Software. However, the commercial type name does not itemize the minor configuration options of
the TOE, which are introduced in section 1.4.2.2. Instead, minor configuration options are identified during the
ordering process, which is coupled to the NCN and CCN of the commercial type name.

1.4.3       Logical Scope of TOE
1.4.3.1     Hardware Description
The TOE distinguishes five TOE modes:

   1. Super System Mode (SSM)

   2. Configuration Mode (CM)

   3. Test Mode (Test Mode)

   4. System Mode (SM)

   5. User Mode (UM)

The Super System Mode is not available to the Security IC Embedded Software. In Super System Mode the
TOE executes the Boot Software resp. the IC Dedicated Test Software. Notice that the Firmware Interface also
executes in Super System Mode and other parts are executed in System Mode and can be accessed via so-
called system calls either from User Mode or System Mode. The Security IC Embedded Software may execute in
System Mode or User Mode. Note also that the CPU itself only distinguishes between the User Mode, the System
Mode and the Super System Mode. From CPU’s perspective there is no difference between the Test Mode, the

Configuration Mode and the Super System Mode. The difference from system perspective is only that the Test
Mode and Configuration Mode can extend their access rights to Special Function Registers compared to what
is visible in Super System Mode (it can grant access to test features). However, this is enforced by the Memory
Management Unit where the Test Mode and Configuration Mode are modelled as an own mode that has extended
access rights compared to Super System Mode.
The N7021 VA is able to control two different logical phases. After production of the Security IC every start-up or
reset completes with execution of the IC Dedicated Test Software. The test functionality is disabled at the end of
the production test. Afterwards, every start-up or reset ends up in System Mode or User Mode, depending on the
minor configuration ’Customer Type’ selected by the customer.
System Mode and User Mode are available to the developer of the Security IC Embedded Software. System
Mode has broader access to the hardware components available to the Security IC Embedded Software. User
Mode has restricted access to the CPU, specific Special Function Registers and the memories depending on
the access rights granted by software running in System Mode. The hardware components are controlled by the
Security IC Embedded Software via Special Function Registers. Both are interrelated to the activities of the CPU,
the Memory Management Unit, interrupt control, I/O configuration, NVM, timers and the coprocessors.
The N7021 VA provides interrupts. Interrupts force a jump to a specific fixed vector address in the ROM or Flash.
Any interrupt can therefore be controlled and guided by a specific part of the Security IC Embedded Software. In
addition, N7021 VA provides user calls and system calls. These calls have to be explicitly done by the Security
IC Embedded Software via dedicated CPU instructions. A user call starts the execution of related code dedicated
to one lower privileged mode (Super System Mode to System Mode or System Mode to User Mode). A system
call starts the execution of related code dedicated to one higher privileged mode (User Mode to System Mode or
System Mode to Super System Mode).
The Watchdog timer is intended to abort irregular program executions by a time-out mechanism and is enabled
and configured by the Security IC Embedded Software.
The N7021 VA incorporates 320 kBytes of Flash, 10 kBytes of RAM and up to 188 kBytes of program memory
available in ROM. Access control to all three memory types is enforced by a Memory Management Unit (MMU).
The System Mode OS provides a simplification of the resource management (e.g. MMU firewall settings, dynamic
segment setup, peripheral access control). The MMU partitions each memory into several parts, defined as
objects in the Hardware Access Control Policy (see section 6.1.6).
The Triple-DES coprocessor supports single DES and Triple-DES operations. Only Triple-DES in 3-key operation
(168-bit) is in the scope of this evaluation. The AES coprocessor supports AES operation with three different key
lengths of 128, 192 or 256 bit. The Public Key Crypto Coprocessor (PKCC) coprocessor supplies basic arithmetic
functions to support implementation of asymmetric cryptographic algorithms by the Security IC Embedded Soft-
ware. The random number generator provides true random numbers without pseudo random calculation. The
deterministic random number generator provides pseudo-random calculation seeded by the true random number
generator. The CRC coprocessor provides CRC generation polynomial CRC-8, CRC-16 and CRC-32.
The N7021 VA operates with a single external power supply of 1.8V, 3V or 5V nominal. Alternatively the TOE can
be supplied via the RF interface by means of inductive coupling. The maximum external clock frequency used

for synchronization of the ISO/IEC 7816 communication is 10 MHz nominal, the CPU and all coprocessors are
supplied exclusively with an internally generated clock signal which frequency can be selected by the Security IC
Embedded Software. The N7021 VA provides power saving modes with reduced activity. These are named IDLE
Mode and SLEEP Mode, of which the latter one includes CLOCK STOP Mode.
The TOE protects secret data, which are stored to and operated by the TOE, against physical tampering. A
memory encryption is added to the memories RAM, ROM and Flash such that data stored to these memories is
encrypted. Chip shielding is added in form of active and passive shield over the whole chip surface. Sensors in
form of light, voltage, temperature and frequency sensors are distributed over the chip area. The security func-
tionality of the IC hardware platform is mainly provided by the TOE, and completed by the Security IC Embedded
Software. This causes dependencies between the security functionality of the TOE and the security functionality
provided by the Security IC Embedded Software.

either UM-B_Code_Seg (User Mode of Card B) or stored in the SM-B_Code_Seg (System Mode of Card B) if the
customer is a System Mode customer. If a customer did not order any NXP developed Security IC Embedded
Software product (such as MIFARE), then User Mode Card A is not present. The physical location of the Security
IC Embedded Software can be either in ROM or in Flash and is not in the scope of this evaluation.
The separation between two logical cards (Card A and Card B) is provided by the so-called ”Vertical IP firewall”
which allows having two completely separated logical cards on the same hardware without any unintended impact
on each other. Because a logical card is also divided into a User Mode and a System Mode, it is possible to
implement a security feature called ”Secure User Mode Box”.
The ”Secure User Mode Box” makes sure that NXP code and data residing in the User Mode of Card A (for
example, a MIFARE Operating System) cannot have any security impact on the certified IC configuration. This
is achieved because the System Mode OS in logical Card A restricts access of code executed in User Mode on
logical Card A such that no influence to any other mode and card is possible. For the ”Secure User Mode Box”
fixed values are NXP defined during production.
Using shared memory segments it is possible to share data or code between the separated logical cards. The
owner of a memory block has to explicitly allow this kind of sharing. The libraries are shared between the logical
cards using this mechanism, reducing the footprint, as code only has to be present on the device once. An
Intercard communication mechanism allows the currently active card to send a message to the inactive card with
a request for card switching. This mechanism allows for the handover of execution between the logical cards.
The IC Dedicated Test Software is developed by NXP and embedded in the Test Software. The IC Dedicated
Test Software includes the test operating system, test routines for the various blocks of the circuitry, control
flags for the status of the Flash’s manufacturer area and shutdown functions to ensure that security relevant test
routines cannot be executed illegally after phase 3. This is stored in the SSM_Data_Seg. Moreover, the IC
Dedicated Test Software is used to download patch code related to System Mode (stored in SM-A_Code_Seg or
SM-B_Code_Seg) or User Mode (stored in UM-A_Code_Seg or UM-B_Code_Seg).
The IC Dedicated Support Software comprises the following parts:

   1. The Boot Software is executed after each reset of the TOE, i.e. every time when the TOE starts. It sets up the
         TOE and does some basic configuration of the hardware based on the settings stored in SSM_Data_Seg,
         respectively. The Boot Software is stored in the SSM_Code_Seg.

   2. The Firmware Interface is stored in the SSM_Code_Seg. It provides low-level flash management, the Post
         Delivery Configuration feature and basic system functionality like self-testing, error-counter handling and
         reset functionality. Notice, that Boot Software and IC Dedicated Test Software also access the Firmware
         Interface.

   3. The System Mode OS is an Operating System developed by NXP and stored in the SM-A_Code_Seg and/or
         in the SM-B_Code_Seg and is accessed by the Security IC Embedded Software via system calls. It offers
         ready-to-use resource and access management for arbitrary customer applications that do not want to be
         exposed to the more low-level features such as MMU configuration. The System Mode OS on Card A is

         mandatory when the Flashloader OS is part of the product, when library code is shared between the logical
         cards or when Card A is activated. The System Mode OS on Card B is mandatory for User Mode customers.
         For System Mode customers who do not need any NXP library and no Flashloader OS and no activated
         Card A, the System Mode OS is deactivated and cannot be executed.

   4. The Shared OS Libraries are an optional module and can be stored in any Card and mode. It provides
         simplified communication, CRC and memory functions to the Security IC Embedded Software. The Shared
         OS Libraries are required by the Flashloader OS.

   5. The Symmetric Crypto Library is an optional library which provides functions to access AES, DES, RNG and
         Secure Operations functionality to the Security IC Embedded Software. It is mandatory for the Flashloader
         OS. The physical location of the Symmetric Crypto Library depends on the configuration selected by the
         customer. For products that include the Flashloader OS, the Symmetric Crypto Library is located in ROM.
         For products without the Flashloader OS, the physical location depends on how the customer linked the
         Symmetric Crypto Library into their Security IC Embedded Software using the development tools.

   6. The Flashloader OS is an optional module and stored in the SM-B_Code_Seg and cannot be directly ac-
         cessed by the Security IC Embedded Software. It supports the download of code and data to Flash by
         the Composite Product Manufacturer before Operational Usage (e.g. during development). This function-
         ality can be made unavailable after usage. When the Flashloader OS module is available, the Shared OS
         Libraries, Symmetric Crypto Library and System Mode OS become mandatory.

All logical dependencies of the IC Dedicated Support Software are described in the definitions above.

1.4.3.3     Security functionality dependency on optional software
As some of the modules and libraries are optional, the security functionality mentioned in this ST also becomes
optional. If the Symmetric Crypto Library is not part of the TOE, the SFRs related to SS.SW_DES, SS.SW_AES,
SS.SW_RNG and SF.Object_Reuse are not available. If the System Mode OS is optional, SS.Loader will no
longer work (as System Mode OS functionally supports SS.Loader). SF.MEM_SUB will also not be available, as
the System Mode OS makes sure that the MMU gets properly configured for this functionality.

1.4.3.4     Documentation
The documents containing a functional description and guidelines for the use of the security functionality, as
needed to develop Security IC Embedded Software, are listed in Table 1.1. The whole documentation shall be
used by the developer to develop the Security IC Embedded Software.

1.4.4       Security during Development and Production
The Security IC product life-cycle is scheduled in phases as introduced in the PP [26]. IC Development as well as
IC Manufacturing and Testing, which are phases 2 and 3 of the life-cycle, are part of the evaluation. Phase 4 the
IC Packaging is also part of the evaluation. The Security IC is delivered at the end of phase 3 or phase 4 in the
life-cycle. The development and production environment of the TOE ranges from phase 2 to TOE Delivery.

With respect to Application Note 3 in [26] the TOE supports the authentic delivery using the FabKey feature. For
further details refer to the data sheet [25] and the guidance and operation manual [13].
During the design and the layout process only personnel involved in the specific development project for an IC
have access to sensitive data. Different teams are responsible for the design data and for customer related data.
The production of the wafers includes two different steps regarding the production flow. In the first step the wafers
are produced with the fixed masks independent of the NCN or CCN. After that step the wafers are completed with
the product type specific data, including ROM and Flash Code, and data (if applicable) as identified by NCN and
CCN. The test process of every die is performed by a test center of NXP. Delivery processes between the involved
sites provide accountability and traceability of the TOE. NXP embeds the dice into modules, inlays or packages
depending on the individual commercial type.
Information about non-functional items (so-called failed die) is stored on electronic media, and the access to this
media made available with the delivery. The availability of major configuration options of the TOE in package
types is detailed in section 1.4.2.1.

1.4.5    TOE Intended Usage
The end-consumer environment of the TOE is phase 7 of the Security IC product life-cycle as defined in the PP
[26]. In this phase the Security IC product is in usage by the end-consumer. Its method of use now depends on
the Security IC Embedded Software. The Security ICs including the N7021 VA can be used to perform various
functions in a wide range of applications. Examples are identity cards, Banking Cards, Pay-TV, Health cards and
Transportation cards. The end-user environment covers a wide spectrum of very different functions, thus making
it difficult to monitor and avoid abuse of the TOE. The TOE is intended to be used in an insecure environment,
which does not protect against threats.
The device is developed for high-end safeguarded applications, and is designed for embedding into chip cards
according to ISO/IEC 7816 [9] and for contactless applications according to ISO/IEC 14443 [30]. Usually a Secu-
rity IC (e.g. a smartcard) is assigned to a single individual only, but it may also be used by multiple applications in
a multi-provider environment. Therefore the TOE might store and process secrets of several systems, which must
be protected from each other. The TOE then must meet security requirements for each single security module.
Secret data shall be used as input for calculation of authentication data, calculation of signatures and encryption
of data and keys.
In development and production environment of the TOE the Security IC Embedded Software developer and system
integrators such as the terminal software developer may use samples of the TOE for their testing purposes. It is
not intended that they are able to change the behaviour of the Security IC in another way than an end-consumer.
The user environment of the TOE ranges from TOE delivery to phase 7 of the Security IC product life-cycle, and
must be a controlled environment up to phase 6.
Note:         The phases from TOE Delivery to phase 7 of the Security IC Product life-cycle are not part of the TOE
              construction process in the sense of this Security Target. Information about these phases is just included
              to describe how the TOE is used after its construction. Nevertheless such security functionality of the

                 TOE, that is independent of the Security IC Embedded Software, is active at TOE Delivery and cannot be
                 disabled by the Security IC Embedded Software in the following phases.


1.4.6       Interface of the TOE
The electrical interface of the N7021 VA are the pads to connect the lines power supply, ground, reset input, clock
input, serial communication pad I/O1, as well as two pads (called LA and LB) for the antenna of the RF interface
(See Figure 1.1). Communication with the TOE can be established via the contact interface through the ISO/IEC
7816 UART or direct usage of the I/O ports. Contactless communication is done via the the contactless interface
unit (CIU) compatible to ISO/IEC 14443.
The logical interface of the TOE depends on the CPU mode and the associated software.

     • Upon every start-up the Boot Software is executed in Super System Mode. This software initializes and
         configures the TOE. This comprises the selection of IC Dedicated Test Software (before TOE delivery) and
         of Security IC Embedded Software (after TOE delivery). Only in case the minor configuration option ’Enable
         Chip Health Mode’ is enabled, starting of built-in self test routines and read-out of TOE identification items is
         supported. If this minor configuration option is disabled the Boot Software provides no interface. In this case
         there is no possibility to interact with this software. The Boot Software is stored in the SSM_Code_Seg.

     • Before TOE delivery the logical interface is defined by the IC Dedicated Test Software. This IC Dedicated
         Test Software is executed in Super System Mode and comprises the test operating system used for produc-
         tion testing. IC Dedicated Test Software is embedded in the Test Software.

     • In System Mode and User Mode (after TOE Delivery) the software interface is the set of instructions, the
         bits in the special function registers that are related to these modes and the physical address map of the
         CPU including memories. The access to the special function registers as well as to the memories depends
         on the TOE mode configured by the Security IC Embedded Software.

Note:            The logical interface of the TOE that is visible on the electrical interface after TOE Delivery is based on the
                 Security IC Embedded Software developed by the software developer. The identification and authentication
                 of the user in System Mode or User Mode must be controlled by the Security IC Embedded Software.

The chip surface can be seen as an interface of the TOE, too. This interface must be taken into account regarding
environmental stress e.g. like temperature and in the case of an attack, for which the attacker manipulates the
chip surface.
Note:            An external voltage and timing supply as well as a logical interface are necessary for the operation of the
                 TOE. Beyond the physical behavior the logical interface is defined by the Security IC Embedded Software.

         CCMB-2017-04-004, Revision 5, April 2017, [6]

This Security Target claims to be CC Part 2 extended and CC Part 3 conformant. The extended Security Func-
tional Requirements are defined in chapter 5.


2.1        Package Claim
This Security Target claims conformance to the assurance package EAL6 augmented. The augmentations to
EAL6 is ALC_FLR.1. In addition, the Security Target is augmented using the component ASE_TSS.2, which is
chosen to include architectural information on the security functionality of the TOE.
Note:            The Protection Profile (PP) ”Security IC Platform Protection Profile with Augmentation Packages” [26] to
                 which this Security Target claims conformance (refer to section 2.2) requires assurance level EAL4 aug-
                 mented. The changes, which are needed for EAL6, are described in the relevant sections of this Security
                 Target.

The level of evaluation and the functionality of the TOE are chosen in order to allow the confirmation that the TOE
is suitable for use within devices compliant with the German Digital Signature Law.


2.2        PP Claim
This Security Target claims strict conformance to the Protection Profile (PP) "Security IC Platform Protection
Profile with Augmentation Packages, Version 1.0, registered and certified by Bundesamt fuer Sicherheit in der
Informationstechnik (BSI) under the reference BSI-PP-0084-2014" [26]. Thus, the concepts are used in the same
sense. For the definition of terms refer to [26]. This chapter does not need any supplement in the Security Target.
This conformance claim includes the following packages of security requirements out of those for Cryptographic
Services defined in the Protection Profile [26]:

     • Package ”TDES” (package conformant)

     • Package ”AES” (package conformant)

This conformance claim includes the following packages of security requirements out of those for Loader defined
in the Protection Profile [26]:

     • Package ”Package 1: Loader dedicated for usage in Secured Environment only” (package conformant)

     • Package ”Package 2: Loader dedicated for usage by authorized users only” (package conformant)

The TOE provides additional functionality, which is not covered in [26]. In accordance with Application Note 4 of
[26] this additional functionality is added using the policy P.Add-Components (see section 3.3).


2.3      Conformance Claim Rationale
According to section 2.2 this ST claims strict conformance to the Security IC Platform Protection Profile with
Augmentation Packages [26].
The TOE type defined in section 1.3.2 of this Security Target is a smartcard controller with IC Dedicated Software.
This is consistent with the TOE definition for a Security IC in section 1.2.2 of [26].
The sections within this document where security problem definitions, security objectives and security require-
ments are defined, clearly state which of these items are taken from the Protection Profile and which are added
in this Security Target. Moreover, all additionally stated items in this Security Target do not contradict the items
included from the PP (see the respective sections in this document). The operations done for the SFRs taken
from the PP are also clearly indicated.
The evaluation assurance level claimed for this TOE is shown in section 6.2 to include respectively exceed the
requirements claimed by the PP (EAL4+).
These considerations show that the Security Target correctly claims conformance to the Security IC Platform
Protection Profile with Augmentation Packages, [26].

3        Security Problem Definition
This chapter lists the assets, threats, assumptions and organizational security policies from the PP [26] and
describes extensions to these elements in detail.


3.1        Description of Assets
All assets, which are defined in section 3.1 of the PP [26], are related to standard functionality. They are applied
in this Security Target. These assets are:

     • Integrity and confidentiality of User Data stored and in operation,

     • Integrity and confidentiality of Security IC Embedded Software, stored and in operation,

     • Correct operation of the Security Services provided by the TOE for the Security IC Embedded Software,

     • Deficiency of random numbers.

To be able to protect these assets the TOE shall protect its security functionality. Therefore critical information on
the TOE shall be protected. Critical information includes:

     • Logical design data, physical design data, IC Dedicated Software,

     • Initialization data and pre-personalization data, Security IC Embedded Software, specific development aids,
         test and characterization related data, material for software development support, photo masks.

Note that the keys for cryptographic calculations using security services of the TOE are treated as User Data.


3.2        Threats
All threats, which are defined in section 3.2 of the PP [26], are valid for this Security Target.
T.Leak-Inherent          Inherent Information Leakage
                         An attacker may exploit information which is leaked from the TOE during usage of the Security IC
                         in order to disclose confidential user data as part of the assets.

T.Phys-Probing           Physical Probing
                         An attacker may perform physical probing of the TOE in order

                           (i) to disclose user data while stored in protected memory areas,
                          (ii) to disclose/reconstruct the user data while processed or
                          (iii) to disclose other critical information about the operation of the TOE to enable attacks dis-
                              closing or manipulating the user data of the Composite TOE or the Security IC Embedded
                              Software.

T.Malfunction         Malfunction due to Environmental Stress
                      An attacker may cause a malfunction of TSF or of the Security IC Embedded Software by applying
                      environmental stress in order to

                        (i) modify security services of the TOE or
                        (ii) modify functions of the Security IC Embedded Software
                       (iii) deactivate or affect security mechanisms of the TOE to enable attacks disclosing or manipu-
                            lating the user data of the Composite TOE or the Security IC Embedded Software.

                      This may be achieved by operating the Security IC outside the normal operating conditions (Num-
                      bers 1, 2 and 9 in Figure 8 of the Security IC PP).

T.Phys-Manipulation Physical Manipulation
                      An attacker may physically modify the Security IC in order to

                        (i) modify user data of the Composite TOE,
                        (ii) modify the Security IC Embedded Software,
                       (iii) modify or deactivate security services of the TOE, or
                       (iv) modify security mechanisms of the TOE to enable attacks disclosing or manipulating the user
                            data of the Composite TOE or the Security IC Embedded Software.

T.Leak-Forced         Forced Information Leakage
                      An attacker may exploit information which is leaked from the TOE during usage of the Security IC
                      in order to disclose confidential user data of the Composite TOE as part of the assets even if the
                      information leakage is not inherent but caused by the attacker.

T.Abuse-Func          Abuse of Functionality
                      An attacker may use functions of the TOE which may not be used after TOE Delivery in order to

                        (i) disclose or manipulate user data of the Composite TOE,
                        (ii) manipulate (explore, bypass, deactivate or change) security services of the TOE or
                       (iii) manipulate (explore, bypass, deactivate or change) functions of the Security IC Embedded
                            Software or
                       (iv) enable an attack disclosing or manipulating the user data of the Composite TOE or the Se-
                            curity IC Embedded Software.

T.RND                 Deficiency of Random Numbers
                      An attacker may predict or obtain information about random numbers generated by the TOE secu-
                      rity service for instance because of a lack of entropy of the random numbers provided.

The threats defined in the PP [26] are listed in Table 3.1.

  Management of TSF-Data
  The TOE allows only in its PERSONALISATION life-cycle state TSF data to be
  written onto the TOE.
  In OPERATIONAL life-cycle state the management of TSF-Data can only be
  performed:
    After successful Terminal Authentication. Updating the Country Verifier
      Certification Authority Public Key and Certificate is restricted to the
      Country Verifier Certification Authority. Modifying the Current Date is
      restricted to the Country Verifier Certification Authority, the Document
      Verifier and the domestic Extended Inspection System.
    After verification of the user PIN or PUK by issuing a dedicated PIN change
      command (RRC).

SF.IA.1 The implementation of PACE contributes to:
     FIA_AFL.1/PACE, Authentication failure handling PACE authentication using
        non-blocking authorisation data. The TOE increases the reaction time of
        the TOE after an unsuccessful authentication attempt with a wrong
        PACE passwords.
     FIA_UID.1/PACE, Timing of identification. The TOE allows to carry out the
        PACE Protocol after successful user identification
     FIA_UAU.1/PACE, Timing of authentication. The TOE prevents reuse of
        authentication data related to the PACE protocol, i.e. according
        authentication mechanisms.
     FIA_UAU.4/PACE, Single-use authentication mechanisms - Single-use
        authentication of the Terminal by the TOE
     FIA_UAU.5/PACE, Multiple authentication mechanisms to support user
        authentication. The TOE provides multiple authentication mechanisms,
        PACE, symmetric key based authentication mechanism, etc.
     FIA_UAU.6/PACE, Re-authenticating of Terminal by the TOE. The TOE re-
        authenticates the connected terminal, if a secure messaging error
        occurred.

                       The justification related to the policy “Additional Specific Security Components (P.Add-
                       Components)” is detailed below.
                       The justification related to the threat “Unauthorised Memory or Hardware Access
                       (T.Unauthorised-Access)” is as follows:
                       According to O.FM_FW, O.MEM_ACCESS and O.SFR_ACCESS the TOE must enforce
                       the partitioning of memory areas in Firmware Mode, System Mode and User Mode and
                       enforce the segmentation of the memory areas in User Mode so that access of software
                       to memory areas is controlled. Any restrictions have to be defined by the Security IC
                       Embedded Software. Thereby security violations caused by accidental or deliberate
                       access to restricted data (which may include code) can be prevented (refer to
                       T.Unauthorised-Access). The threat T.Unauthorised-Access is therefore covered by the
                       objective.
                       The clarification of “Usage of Hardware Platform (OE.Plat-Appl)” makes clear that it is up
                       to the Security IC Embedded Software to implement the memory management scheme by
                       appropriately administrating the TSF. This is also expressed both in T.Unauthorised-
                       Access and O.FM_FW, O.MEM_ACCESS and O.SFR_ACCESS. The TOE shall provide
                       access control functions to be used by the Security IC Embedded Software. This is further
                       emphasised by the clarification of “Treatment of User Data (OE.Resp-Appl)” which reminds
                       that the Security IC Embedded Software must not undermine the restrictions of the
                       hardware platform. Therefore, the clarifications contribute to the coverage of the threat
                       T.Unauthorised-Access.
                       The justification related to the security objectives O.HW_DES3, O.HW_AES,
                       O.CUST_RECONFIG and O.EEPROM_INTEGRITY is as follows: Since these objectives
                       require the TOE to implement exactly the same specific security functionality as required
                       by P.Add-Components, the organisational security policy is covered by the objectives.
                       Nevertheless the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing, O.Malfunction,
                       O.Phys-Manipulation and O.Leak-Forced define how to implement the specific security
                       functionality required by P.Add-Components. These security objectives are also valid for
                       the additional specific security functionality since they must avert the related threats also
                       for the components added related to the policy.
                       The requirements for a multi-application platform necessitate the separation of users.
                       Therefore it is volitional that most of the security functionality can not be influenced or used
                       in User Mode.
                       The justification related to the assumption A.Key-Function is as follows:
                           • Compared to [6] a clarification has been made for the security objective “Usage of
                             Hardware Platform (OE.Plat-Appl)”: If required the Security IC Embedded Software
                             shall use the cryptographic service of the TOE and its interface as specified. In
                             addition, the Security IC Embedded Software (i) must implement operations on keys
                             (if any) in such a manner that they do not disclose information about confidential data
                             and (ii) must configure the memory management in a way that different applications

                             are sufficiently separated. If the Security IC Embedded Software uses random
                             numbers provided by the security service SS.RNG these random numbers must be
                             tested as appropriate for the intended purpose. This addition ensures that the
                             assumption A.Key-Function is still covered by the objective OE.Plat-Appl although
                             additional functions are being supported according to P.Add-Components.
                           • Compared to [6] a clarification has been made for the security objective “Treatment of
                             User Data (OE.Resp-Appl)”: By definition cipher or plain text data and cryptographic
                             keys are User Data. So, the Security IC Embedded Software will protect such data if
                             required and use keys and functions appropriately in order to ensure the strength of
                             cryptographic operation. Quality and confidentiality must be maintained for keys that
                             are imported and/or derived from other keys. This implies that appropriate key
                             management has to be implemented in the environment. In addition, the treatment of
                             User Data comprises the implementation of a multi-application operating system that
                             does not disclose security relevant User Data of one application to another one. These
                             measures make sure that the assumption A.Key-Function is still covered by the
                             security objective OE.Resp-Appl although additional functions are being supported
                             according to P.Add-Components.
                       The justification related to the assumption "Check of initialisation data by the Security IC
                       Embedded Software (A.Check-Init)" is as follows:
                       Since OE.Check-Init requires the Security IC Embedded Software developer to implement
                       a function assumed in A.Check-Init, the assumption is covered by the objective.
                       The justification of the additional policy and the additional assumptions show that they do
                       not contradict to the rationale already given in the PP [6] for the assumptions, policy and
                       threats defined there.

5. Extended Components Definition
                       This Security Target does not define extended components.
                       Note that the PP “Security IC Protection Profile” [6] defines extended security functional
                       requirements in chapter 5, which are included in this Security Target.
                       The extended component definition used for Random Number Generator has been taken
                       from [8].

6. Security Requirements
                       This part of the Security Target defines the detailed security requirements that shall be
                       satisfied by the TOE. The statement of TOE security requirements shall define the
                       functional and assurance security requirements that the TOE needs to satisfy in order to
                       meet the security objectives for the TOE. This chapter consists of the sections “Security
                       Functional Requirements”, “Security Assurance Requirements” and “Security
                       Requirements Rationale”.
                       The CC allows several operations to be performed on security requirements (on the
                       component level); refinement, selection, assignment, and iteration are defined in
                       paragraph 8.1 of Part 1 of the CC [1]. These operations are used in the PP [6] and in this
                       Security Target, respectively.
                       The refinement operation is used to add details to requirements, and, thus, further
                       restricts a requirement. Refinements of security requirements are denoted in such a way
                       that added words are in bold text and changed words are crossed out.
                       The selection operation is used to select one or more options provided by the PP [6] or
                       CC in stating a requirement. Selections having been made are denoted as italic text.
                       The assignment operation is used to assign a specific value to an unspecified
                       parameter, such as the length of a password. Assignments having been made are
                       denoted by showing as italic text.
                       The iteration operation is used when a component is repeated with varying operations. It
                       is denoted by showing brackets “[iteration indicator]” and the iteration indicator within the
                       brackets.
                       For the sake of a better readability, the iteration operation may also be applied to some
                       single components (being not repeated) in order to indicate belonging of such SFRs to
                       same functional cluster. In such a case, the iteration operation is applied to only one
                       single component.
                       Whenever an element in the PP [6] contains an operation that the PP author left
                       uncompleted, the ST author has to complete that operation.

                 6.1 Security Functional Requirements
                       The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) of the TOE are presented in the following
                       sections to support a better understanding of the combination of PP “Security IC
                       Protection Profile” [6] and Security Target.
                  6.1.1 SFRs of the Protection Profile
                       Table 21 below shows all SFRs, which are specified in the PP [6] (in the order of definition
                       in the PP). Some of the SFRs are CC Part 2 extended and defined in the PP [6]. This is
                       shown in the third column of the table.

                       The operations for all SFR except for the SFR FAU_SAS.1 and FCS_RNG.1 are already
                       performed in the PP [6]. They are not changed compared to the Protection Profile. The
                       open assignments and selections for FAU_SAS.1 and FCS_RNG.1 are included in the
                       following.
                       For the SFR FAU_SAS.1 the PP [6] leaves the assignment operation open for the
                       non-volatile memory type in which initialisation data, pre-personalisation data and/or other

                       For FCS_RNG.1.1 the PP [6] partially fills in the assignment for the security capabilities of
                       the RNG by requiring a total failure test of the random source and adds an assignment
                       operation for additional security capabilities of the RNG.
                       In addition, for FCS_RNG.1.2 the PP [6] partially fills in the assignment operation for the
                       defined quality metric for the random numbers by replacing it by a selection and
                       assignment operation.
                       For the above operations the original operations defined in chapter 5 of the PP [6] have
                       been replaced by operations defined in chapter 3 of [8] and the open operations of the
                       partially filled in operations in the statement of the security requirements in section 4.4 of

6.3.3.1.1 Rationale for the exclusion of Dependencies


The dependency FMT_MSA.3 of FDP_ACF.1/TRM is discarded. The access
  control TSF according to FDP_ACF.1/TRM uses security attributes which are
  defined during the personalisation and are fixed over the whole life time of the
  TOE. No management of these security attribute (i.e. SFR FMT_MSA.1 and
  FMT_MSA.3) is necessary here.

6.3.4 Rationale for the Security Assurance Requirements
The EAL5 was chosen to permits a developer to gain maximum assurance from
positive security engineering based upon rigorous commercial development
practices supported by moderate application of specialist security engineering
techniques. Such a TOE will probably be designed and developed with the intent
of achieving EAL5 assurance. It is likely that the additional costs attributable to
the EAL5 requirements, relative to rigorous development without the application
of specialised techniques, will not be large.

6.3.5 AVA_VAN.5 Advanced methodical vulnerability analysis
The selection of the component AVA_VAN.5 provides the assurance that the TOE
is  data must be protected against unauthorized modification
                       by physical attacks.

                  3.2 Configuration Module

                 3.2.1 SA.CONFIGURATION-MODULE: Configuration Module
                       The Configuration Module is a JCOP functionality which allows to read and modify
                       configuration items in the configuration area of the TOE.

                  3.3 Modular Design

                 3.3.1 SA.MODULAR-DESIGN: Modular Design
                       The TOE might contain one or more Modules implementing particular functionality. The
                       list of Modules present in the TOE must be retrievable. The Modules have an associated
                       AID which allows to identify them. The AID is equivalent to the Package AID of JavaCard
                       packages. Modules can only be deleted, re-loading of a previously deleted module or
                       replacing a present module must not be possible. Interfaces to a Module can be Public
                       or TOE internal. Public Interfaces can directly be accessed by any Applet or via an
                       APDU, TOE internal interfaces can only be accessed by the TOE itself, Applets use the
                       corresponding JavaCard API [14].

                 3.3.2 SA.MODULE-INVOCATION: Module Invocation
                       Invoking a module must be transparent to the user. If a Module has a TOE internal
                       interface, is not present and is invoked by the user, the TOE must preserve a secure
                       state by throwing an exception or returning an appropriate error status word to the CAD.

4       Security Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)
                       The Security Problem Definition is described within the following sections. Only additional
                       and refined items compared to the PP [6] are described.

                  4.1 Assets
                       Assets are security-relevant elements to be directly protected by the TOE. Confidentiality
                       of assets is always intended with respect to un-trusted people or software, as various
                       parties are involved during the first stages of the smart card product life-cycle. Details
                       concerning the threats are given in Section 4.2 "Threats" hereafter.
                       Assets have to be protected, some in terms of confidentiality and some in terms of
                       integrity or both integrity and confidentiality. These assets might get compromised by the
                       threats that the TOE is exposed to.
                       The assets to be protected by the TOE are listed below. They are grouped according to
                       whether it is data created by and for the user (User data) or data created by and for the
                       TOE (TSF data). This definition of grouping is taken from Section 5.1 of [6].

                                                          with the AP. These keys can be used to load and install applications
                                                          on the card if the Security Domain has the appropriate privileges. To

                                                          cryptographic keys are needed to perform card management
                                                          operations on the card. To be protected from unauthorized disclosure

                                                          DAP signature. To be protected from unauthorized disclosure and
                                                          modification.
                       D.CARD_MNGT_DATA                   The data of the card management environment, like for instance,

                                                          unauthorized modification.


                 4.1.2 TSF Data

                       D.CONFIG_ITEM                 A configuration that can be changed using the Configuration Mechanism.
                       D.MODULE_CODE                 The code of a Module. The code of a module might comprise Java code,
                                                     native code, code of a native Library or a combination of them. To be

                  4.2.2 Unauthorized Execution

                 4.2.2.1 T.MODULE_EXEC: Code Execution of Modules

                        The attacker bypasses the presence check of a Module which is not present with
                        TOE internal interface to execute arbitrary code. See SA.MODULAR-DESIGN and
                        SA.MODULE-INVOCATION for details. Directly threatened asset(s): D.MODULE_

                        The attacker performs unauthorized card management operations (for instance
                        impersonates one of the actor represented on the card) in order to take benefit of the

                        •   personalization of an applet or a Security Domain
                        •   deletion of a package file or an applet
                        •   privileges update of an applet or a Security Domain
                        Directly threatened asset(s): D.ISD_KEYS, D.APSD_KEYS, D.APP_C_DATA, D.APP_
                        I_DATA, D.APP_CODE, D.SEC_DATA, and D.CARD_MNGT_DATA (any other asset
                        may be jeopardized should this attack succeed, depending on the virulence of the
                        installed application).
                        This security objective is a refinement of the Threats T.INSTALL and T.DELETION from
                        [6].

                 4.2.3.2 T.COM_EXPLOIT: Communication Channel Remote Exploit

                        An attacker remotely exploits the communication channels established between a third
                        party and the TOE in order to modify or disclose confidential data.
                        All assets are threatened.

                 4.2.3.3 T.LIFE_CYCLE: Life Cycle

                        An attacker accesses to an application outside of its expected availability range thus

                  4.2.4 Operating System

                 4.2.4.1 T.OS_OPERATE: Incorrect Operating System Behavior

                        Modification of the correct OS behavior by unauthorized use of TOE or use of incorrect
                        or unauthorized instructions or commands or sequence of commands, in order to obtain
                        an unauthorized execution of the TOE code. An attacker may cause a malfunction of TSF
                        or of the Smart Card embedded OS in order to (1) by-pass the security mechanisms (i.e.
                        authentication or access control mechanisms) or (2) obtain unexpected result from the
                        embedded OS behavior. Different kind of attack path may be used as:
                        1. Applying incorrect unexpected or unauthorized instructions, commands or command
                           sequences,
                        2. Provoking insecure state by insertion of interrupt (reset), premature termination of
                           transaction or communication between IC and the reading device.
                        Info: Any implementation flaw in the OS itself can be exploited with this attack path
                        to lead to an unsecured state of the state machine of the OS. The attacker uses the
                        available interfaces of the TOE. A user could have certain specified privileges that allow
                        loading of selected programs. Unauthorized programs, if allowed to be loaded, may
                        include either the execution of legitimate programs not intended for use during normal
                        operation (such as patches, filters, Trojan horses, etc.) or the unauthorized loading of
                        programs specifically targeted at penetration or modification of the security functions.
                        Attempts to generate a non-secure state in the Smart Card may also be made through
                        premature termination of transactions or communications between the IC and the card
                        reading device, by insertion of interrupts, or by selecting related applications that may
                        leave files open.

                  4.2.5 Random Numbers

                 4.2.5.1 T.RND: Deficiency of Random Numbers

                        An attacker may predict or obtain information about random numbers generated by
                        the TOE for instance because of a lack of entropy of the random numbers provided.
                        An attacker may gather information about the produced random numbers which might
                        be a problem because they may be used for instance to generate cryptographic keys.
                        Here the attacker is expected to take advantage of statistical properties of the random
                        numbers generated by the TOE without specific knowledge about the TOE’s generator.
                        Malfunctions or premature ageing are also considered which may assist in getting
                        information about random numbers.

                  4.2.6 Configuration Module

                 4.2.6.1 T.CONFIG: Unauthorized configuration

                        The attacker tries to change configuration items without authorization. Directly threatened

                 4.2.7.1 T.SEC_BOX_BORDER: SecureBox Border Infringement

                        An attacker may try to use malicious code placed in the Secure Box to modify the correct
                        behavior of the Operating System (OS). With the aim to
                        1. disclose the Java Card System code,
                        2. disclose or alter applet code, disclose or alter Java Card System data, or disclose or

                   4.3 Organisational Security Policies

                  4.3.1 OSP.PROCESS-TOE: Identification of the TOE
                        An accurate identification must be established for the TOE. This requires that each
                        instantiation of the TOE carries this identification.

                  4.3.2 OSP.KEY-CHANGE: Security Domain Keys Change
                        The Application Provider (AP) shall change its initial security domain keys (APSD) before
                        any operation on its Security Domain.

                  4.3.3 OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS: Security Domains
                        Security domains can be dynamically created, deleted and blocked during usage phase
                        in post-issuance mode.

                  4.3.4 OSP.SECURE-BOX: Secure Box Border
                        Execution of untrusted native code shall be possible without any harm, manipulation, or
                        influence on other parts of the TOE.

                   4.4 Assumptions
                        Note that the assumption A.DELETION is excluded. The Card Manager is part of the
                        TOE and therefore the assumption is no longer relevant.

                  4.4.1 A.USE_DIAG: Usage of TOE’s Secure Communication Protocol by OE
                        It is assumed that the operational environment supports and uses the secure
                        communication protocols offered by the TOE.

                 4.4.2 A.USE_KEYS: Protected Storage of Keys Outside of TOE
                       It is assumed that the keys which are stored outside the TOE and which are used for
                       secure communication and authentication between Smart Card and terminals are
                       protected for confidentiality and integrity in their own storage environment. This is
                       especially true for D.APSD_KEYS, D.ISD_KEYS, and D.VASD_KEYS.
                       Info: This is to assume that the keys used in terminals or systems are correctly
                       protected for confidentiality and integrity in their own environment, as the disclosure of
                       such information which is shared with the TOE but is not under the TOE control, may
                       compromise the security of the TOE.

                 4.4.3 A.PROCESS-SEC-IC: Protection during Packaging, Finishing and
                       Personalisation
                       It is assumed that security procedures are used after delivery of the TOE by the TOE
                       Manufacturer up to delivery to the end consumer to maintain confidentiality and integrity
                       of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test data (to prevent any possible copy,
                       modification, retention, theft or unauthorised use). This means that the Phases after TOE
                       Delivery are assumed to be protected appropriately.
                       The assets to be protected are: The information and material produced and/or processed
                       by the Security IC Embedded Software Developer in Phase 1 and by the Composite
                       Product Manufacturer can be grouped as follows:
                       1. the Security IC Embedded Software including specifications, implementation and
                          related documentation,
                       2. pre-personalisation and personalisation data including specifications of formats and
                          memory areas, test related data,
                       3. the User Data and related documentation, and
                       4. material for software development support
                       as long as they are not under the control of the TOE Manufacturer.

                 4.4.4 A.APPS-PROVIDER: Application Provider
                       The AP is a trusted actor that provides basic or secure applications. He is responsible for
                       his security domain keys (APSD keys).
                       Info: An AP generally refers to the entity that issues the application. For instance it can
                       be a financial institution for a payment application such as EMV or a transport operator
                       for a transport application.

                 4.4.5 A.VERICATION-AUTHORITY: Verification Authority
                       The VA is a trusted actor who is able to guarantee and check the digital signature
                       attached to a basic or secure application.
                       Info: As a consequence, it guarantees the success of the application validation upon
                       loading.

5       Security Objectives
                        The Security Objectives for the TOE, for the operational environment and the security
                        objectives rationale are described within the following sections. Only additional and
                        refined items compared to the PP [6] are described.

                   5.1 Security Objectives for the TOE

                  5.1.1 Identification

                 5.1.1.1 OT.SID_MODULE: Subject Identification of Modules

                        The TOE shall uniquely identify every Module before granting it access to any service.

                  5.1.2 Execution

                 5.1.2.1 OT.SENSITIVE_RESULTS_INTEG: Sensitive Result

                        The TOE shall ensure that the sensitive results
                        (com.nxp.id.jcopx.security.SensitiveResultX) of sensitive operations executed by
                        applications through the Java Card API are protected in integrity specifically against
                        physical attacks.

                  5.1.3 Services

                 5.1.3.1 OT.RNG: Random Numbers Generation

                        The TOE shall ensure the cryptographic quality of random number generation. For
                        instance random numbers shall not be predictable and shall have sufficient entropy. The
                        TOE shall ensure that no information about the produced random numbers is available to
                        an attacker since they might be used for instance to generate cryptographic keys.

                  5.1.4 Applet Management

                 5.1.4.1 OT.APPLI-AUTH: Application Authentication

                        The card manager shall enforce the application security policies established by the card
                        issuer by requiring application authentication during application loading on the card. This
                        security objective is a refinement of the Security Objective O.LOAD from [6].
                        AppNote: Each application loaded onto the TOE has been signed by a VA. The VA
                        will guarantee that the security policies established by the card issuer on applications
                        are enforced. For example this authority (DAP) or a third party (Mandated DAP) can
                        be present on the TOE as a Security Domain whose role is to verify each signature at
                        application loading.

                 5.1.4.2 OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS: Domain Rights

                        The Card issuer shall not get access or change personalized AP Security Domain keys
                        which belong to the AP. Modification of a Security Domain keyset is restricted to the AP
                        who owns the security domain.

                        AppNote: APs have a set of keys that allows them to establish a secure channel between
                        them and the platform. These keys sets are not known by the TOE issuer. The security
                        domain initial keys are changed before any operation on the SD (OE.KEY-CHANGE).

                 5.1.4.3 OT.COMM_AUTH: Communication Mutual Authentication

                        The TOE shall authenticate the origin of the card management requests that the card
                        receives, and authenticate itself to the remote actor.

                 5.1.4.4 OT.COMM_INTEGRITY: Communication Request Integrity

                        The TOE shall verify the integrity of the card management requests that the card
                        receives.

                 5.1.4.5 OT.COMM_CONFIDENTIALITY: Communication Request Confidentiality

                        The TOE shall be able to process card management requests containing encrypted data.

                  5.1.5 Card Management

                 5.1.5.1 OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT: Card Management

                        The TOE shall provide card management functionalities (loading, installation, extradition,
                        deletion of applications and GP registry updates) in charge of the life cycle of the whole
                        device and installed applications (applets). The card manager, the application with
                        specific rights responsible for the administration of the smart card, shall control the
                        access to card management functions. It shall also implement the card issuer’s policy on
                        card management.
                        The Security Objective from [6] for the environment OE.CARD-MANAGEMENT is listed
                        as TOE Security Objective OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT for the TOE as the Card Manager
                        belongs to the TOE for this evaluation. This security objective is a refinement for the
                        Security Objectives O.INSTALL, O.LOAD, and O.DELETION from [6]. Thus, the following
                        objectives are also covered:
                        • The TOE shall ensure that the installation of an applet performs as expected (See
                          SA.INSTALL for details).
                        • The TOE shall ensure that the loading of a package into the card is secure.
                        • The TOE shall ensure that the deletion of a package from the TOE is secure.
                        AppNote: The card manager will be tightly connected in practice with the rest of the TOE,
                        which in return shall very likely rely on the card manager for the effective enforcement
                        of some of its security functions. The mechanism used to ensure authentication of
                        the TOE issuer, that manages the TOE, or of the Service Providers owning a Security
                        Domain with card management privileges is a secure channel. This channel will be
                        used afterwards to protect commands exchanged with the TOE in confidentiality and
                        integrity. The platform guarantees that only the ISD or the Service Providers owning a
                        Security Domain with the appropriate privilege (Delegated Management) can manage the
                        applications on the card associated with its Security Domain. This is done accordingly
                        with the card issuer’s policy on card management. The actor performing the operation
                        must beforehand authenticate with the Security Domain. In the case of Delegated
                        Management, the card management command will be associated with an electronic
                        signature (GlobalPlatform token) verified by the ISD before execution.
                        The Security Objective from [6] for the environment OE.CARD-MANAGEMENT is listed
                        as TOE Security Objective OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT for the TOE as the Card Manager

                         AppNote applicable to O.DELETION applies also:
                         • Usurpation of identity resulting from a malicious installation of an applet on the card
                           may also be the result of perturbing the communication channel linking the CAD and
                           the card. Even if the CAD is placed in a secure environment, the attacker may try to
                           capture, duplicate, permute or modify the packages sent to the card. He may also try to
                           send one of its own applications as if it came from the card issuer. Thus, this objective
                           is intended to ensure the integrity and authenticity of loaded CAP files.

                  5.1.6 Smart Card Platform

                 5.1.6.1 OT.SCP.IC IC: Physical Protection

                         The SCP shall provide all IC security features against physical attacks. This security
                         objective for the environment refers to the point (7) of the security aspect SA.SCP.
                         AppNote: The Security Objectives from [6] for the environment OE.SCP.RECOVERY,
                         OE.SCP.SUPPORT, and OE.SCP.IC are listed as TOE Security Objectives
                         (OT.SCP.RECOVERY, OT.SCP.SUPPORT, and OT.SCP.IC) for the TOE in this section
                         as the Smart Card Platform belongs to the TOE for this evaluation.

                 5.1.6.2 OT.SCP.RECOVERY: SCP Recovery

                         If there is a loss of power, or if the smart card is withdrawn from the CAD while an
                         operation is in progress, the SCP must allow the TOE to eventually complete the
                         interrupted operation successfully, or recover to a consistent and secure state. This
                         security objective for the environment refers to the security aspect SA.SCP.
                         AppNote: The Security Objectives from [6] for the environment OE.SCP.RECOVERY,
                         OE.SCP.SUPPORT, and OE.SCP.IC are listed as TOE Security Objectives

                         as the Smart Card Platform belongs to the TOE for this evaluation.

                 5.1.6.3 OT.SCP.SUPPORT: SCP Support

                         The SCP shall support the TSFs of the TOE. This security objective refers to the security
                         aspects 2, 3, 4 and 5 of SA.SCP.
                         AppNote: The Security Objectives from [6] for the environment OE.SCP.RECOVERY,
                         OE.SCP.SUPPORT, and OE.SCP.IC are listed as TOE Security Objectives
                         (OT.SCP.RECOVERY, OT.SCP.SUPPORT, and OT.SCP.IC) for the TOE in this section
                         as the Smart Card Platform belongs to the TOE for this evaluation.

                 5.1.6.4 OT.IDENTIFICATION: TOE identification

                         The TOE must provide means to store Initialization Data and Pre-personalization Data
                         in its non-volatile memory. The Initialization Data (or parts of them) are used for TOE
                         identification.

                  5.1.7 Secure Box

                 5.1.7.1 OT.SEC_BOX_FW: SecureBox firewall

                        The TOE shall provide separation between the Secure Box native code and the Java
                        Card System. The separation shall comprise software execution and data access.

                  5.1.8 Configuration Module

                 5.1.8.1 OT.CARD-CONFIGURATION: Card Configuration

                        The TOE shall ensure that the customer can only configure customer configuration items
                        and that NXP can configure customer and NXP configuration items.

                 5.1.8.2 OT.SECURE_LOAD_ACODE: Secure loading of the Additional Code

                        This objective is taken over from [8].
                        The Loader of the Initial TOE shall check an evidence of authenticity and integrity of the
                        loaded Additional Code.
                        The Loader enforces that only the allowed version of the Additional Code can be loaded
                        on the Initial TOE. The Loader shall forbid the loading of an Additional Code not intended
                        to be assembled with the Initial TOE.
                        During the Load Phase of an Additional Code, the TOE shall remain secure.

                 5.1.8.3 OT.SECURE_ACTIVATION_ADDITIONAL_CODE: Secure activation of the
                         Additional Code

                        This objective is taken over from [8] (O.Secure_AC_Activation) with editorial modification.
                        Activation of the Additional Code and update of the Identification Data shall be performed
                        at the same time in an Atomic way.
                        All the operations needed for the code to be able to operate as in the Final TOE shall be
                        completed before activation.
                        If the Atomic Activation is successful, then the resulting product is the Final TOE,
                        otherwise (in case of interruption or incident which prevents the forming of the Final
                        TOE), the Initial TOE shall remain in its initial state or fail secure.

                 5.1.8.4 OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION: Secure identification of the TOE

                        This objective is taken over from [8] and further refined.
                        The Identification Data identifies the Initial TOE and Additional Code. The TOE provides
                        means to store Identification Data in its non-volatile memory and guarantees the integrity
                        of these data.
                        After Atomic Activation of the Additional Code, the Identification Data of the Final TOE
                        allows identifications of Initial TOE and Additional Code or the Final TOE. The user shall
                        be able to uniquely identify Initial TOE and Additional Code(s) or the final TOE which are
                        embedded in the Final TOE.

                  5.2 Security Objectives for the Operational Environment

                 5.2.1 OE.APPS-PROVIDER: Application Provider
                      The AP shall be a trusted actor that provides applications. The AP is responsible for its
                      security domain keys.

                 5.2.2 OE.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY: Verification Authority
                      The VA should be a trusted actor who is able to verify bytecode of an application loaded
                      on the card, guarantee and generate the digital signature attached to an application and
                      ensure that its public key for verifying the application signature is on the TOE.

                 5.2.3 OE.PROCESS_SEC_IC: Protection during composite product
                       manufacturing
                      Security procedures shall be used after TOE Delivery up to delivery to the end-consumer
                      to maintain confidentiality and integrity of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test
                      data (to prevent any possible copy, modification, retention, theft or unauthorised use).
                      This means that Phases after TOE Delivery up to the end of Phase 6 must be protected
                      appropriately.

                 5.2.4 OE.KEY-CHANGE: Security Domain Key Change
                      The AP must change its security domain initial keys before any operation on it.

                 5.2.5 OE.SECURITY-DOMAINS: Security Domains
                      Security domains can be dynamically created, deleted and blocked during usage phase
                      in post-issuance mode.

                 5.2.6 OE.USE_DIAG: Secure TOE communication protocols
                      Secure TOE communication protocols shall be supported and used by the environment.

                 5.2.7 OE.USE_KEYS: Protection of OPE keys
                      During the TOE usage, the terminal or system in interaction with the TOE shall ensure
                      the protection (integrity and confidentiality) of their own keys by operational means and/or
                      procedures.

                  5.3 Security Objectives Rationale
                      In this section it is proven that the security objectives described in Section 4 "Security
                      Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)" can be traced for all aspects identified in the TOE-
                      security environment and that they are suited to cover them. At least one security
                      objective results from each assumption, OSP, and each threat. At least one threat, one
                      OSP or assumption exists for each security objective.

                      functional requirements for the storage of audit data. It has a more general approach
                      than FAU_GEN, because it does not necessarily require the data to be generated by
                      the TOE itself and because it does not give specific details of the content of the audit
                      records.
                      The family “Audit data storage (FAU_SAS)” is specified as follows.

                 1.2 TOE Overview
                      The TOE consists of the Micro Controller and a software stack which is stored on the
                      Micro Controller and which can be executed by the Micro Controller. The software stack
                      can be further split into the following components:
                      • Firmware for booting and low level functionality of the Micro Controller (MC FW)
                        like writing to flash memory. This includes software for implementing cryptographic
                        operations, called Crypto Library.
                      • Software for implementing a Java Card Virtual Machine [15], a Java Card Runtime
                        Environment [16] and a Java Card Application Programming Interface [14], called
                        JCVM, JCRE and JCAPI.
                      • Software for implementing content management according to GlobalPlatform [17],
                        called GlobalPlatform (GP) Framework.
                      • Software for executing native libraries, called Secure Box.
                      The TOE is referred to as JCOP 4.7 SE051. The JCOP 4 Operating System (JCOP 4
                      OS) consists of the software stack without the Crypto Library (Crypto Lib) and without
                      the Micro Controller Firmware (MC FW). The TOE uses one or more communication
                      interfaces to communicate with its environment.
                      The complete TOE is depicted in Figure 1. The elements are described in more detail in
                      Section 1.3 "TOE Description".

                               Figure 1 shows the components of the TOE. The TOE is a composite product on top
                               of CC certified Hardware, Firmware and Crypto Library. Part of the TOE are the JCVM,
                               JCRE, JCAPI and the GP Framework. Also included is optional functionality and the
                               Secure Box mechanism. The Secure Box Native Librarys provide native functions for
                               untrusted third parties and are not part of the TOE.
                               The figure shows Java Card applets which are small programs in Java language that can
                               be executed by the TOE, but are not part of the TOE.

                     1.2.1 Usage and Major Security Features of the TOE
                               The usage of the TOE is focused on security critical applications in small form factors.
                               One main usage scenario is the use of so called smart cards. Examples of such cards
                               are banking cards or electronic drivers’ licenses. The TOE can also be used in an
                               electronic passport. Another usage scenario is device authentication, where the TOE can
                               be used to prove the authenticity or originality of a device like an accessory for a gaming
                               console.
                               The TOE provides a variety of security features. The hardware of the Micro Controller
                               already protects against logical and physical attacks by applying various sensors to
                               detect manipulations and by processing data in ways which protect against leakage
                               of data by side channel analysis. With the software stack the TOE provides many

                      card verified Java Card applets.

                 1.2.3 Required non-TOE Hardware/Software/Firmware
                      Three groups of users shall be distinguished here.
                      The first group is the end-users group, which uses the TOE with one or more loaded
                      applets in the final form factor like a banking card or an electronic passport. These users
                      only require a communication device to be able to communicate with the TOE. The
                      communication protocol of the TOE is standardized in either ISO7816 [31] (T=1, T=0),
                      ISO14443 [32] (T=CL), or UM10204 [33] (I2C Slave).
                      The second group of users are administrators of cards. They want to configure the
                      card by using the Configuration Module, to install additional applets and to configure and
                      personalise these applets. These users require the same equipment as end-users.
                      The third group of users wants to develop Java Card applets and execute them on
                      the TOE. These applet developers need in addition to the communication device a
                      set of tools for the development of applets. This set of tools can be obtained from the
                      TOE vendor and comprises elements such as PC development environment, byte code
                      verifier, compiler, linker and debugger.

                     1.3 TOE Description

                    1.3.1 TOE Components and Composite Certification
                           The certification of this TOE is a composite certification. The following sections provide
                           a more detailed description of the components of Figure 1. It is also made clear whether
                           a component is covered by a previous certification or whether it is covered in the
                           certification of this TOE.

                  1.3.1.1 Micro Controller

                           The Micro Controller is a secure smart card controller from NXP’s SmartMX3 family.
                           The Micro Controller contains a co-processor for symmetric cryptographic operations,
                           supporting DES and AES, as well as an accelerator for asymmetric cryptographic
                           algorithms. The Micro Controller further contains a physical random number generator.
                           The supported memory technologies are volatile (Random Access Memory (RAM)) and
                           non-volatile (Read Only Memory (ROM) and FLASH) memory.
                           Access to all memory types is controlled by a Memory Management Unit (MMU) which
                           allows to separate and restrict access to parts of the memory.
                           The Micro Controller has been certified in a previous certification and the results are re-
                           used for this certification. The exact reference to the previous certification is given in the
                           following Table 2 "Reference to Certified Micro Controller":

                           Table 2. Reference to Certified Micro Controller

                                                                          [1]

                           Certification ID                BSI-DSZ-CC-1040
                           Reference                       [10]

                           [1]   The SE051 hardware is an instantiation of the N7121 hard macro with I2C side-car.


                  1.3.1.2 Security IC Dedicated Software

                 1.3.1.2.1 MC FW (Micro Controller Firmware)

                           The Micro Controller Firmware is used for testing of the Micro Controller at production,
                           for booting of the Micro Controller after power-up or after reset, for configuration of
                           communication devices and for writing data to volatile and non-volatile memory.
                           The MC FW has been certified together with the Micro Controller and the same reference
                           [10] as given for the Micro Controller also apply for the MC FW.

                 1.3.1.2.2 Crypto Library

                           The Crypto Library provides implementations for symmetric and asymmetric
                           cryptographic operations, hashing, the generation of hybrid deterministic and hybrid
                           physical random numbers and further functions like secure copy and compare.
                           Some of the cryptographic algorithms offered by the Crypto Lib are not certified, see
                           Section 1.3.1.4 "Excluded functionality".
                           The symmetric cryptographic operations comprise the algorithms 3DES and AES. These
                           algorithms use the symmetric co-processor of the Micro Controller.

                          The Crypto Library has been certified together with the Micro Controller and the same
                          reference [10] as given for the Micro Controller also applies.

                  1.3.1.3 Security IC Embedded Software

                 1.3.1.3.1 JCOP 4.7 SE051

                          The OS of the TOE consists of JCVM, JCRE, JCAPI and GP framework. It is
                          implemented according to the Java Card Specification and GlobalPlatform. Additionally it
                          consists of a proprietary API, which is described in the UGM [9].
                          The TOE can be identified by using the IDENTIFY APDU command (see UGM [9]). This
                          command returns the card identification data, which includes a Platform ID, a Patch ID
                          and other information that allows to identify the content in ROM, FLASH and loaded
                          patches (if any).
                          The TOE also includes a Configuration Module (see Section 1.3.2 "Optional TOE
                          Functionality") which is used for personalisation and configuration of the TOE. It must be
                          deleted after the personalisation is finished (end of Phase 6 ”Personalisation”) by using
                          the DELETE APDU command. Once the Configuration Module is deleted, it is no longer
                          possible to configure the TOE.
                          The TOE contains further functionality for integrity protection of user data via an
                          EDC, encryption of user data via PUF [12] and optional functionality as described in
                          Section 1.3.2 "Optional TOE Functionality".

                  1.3.1.4 Excluded functionality

                          All Secure Box Native Libraries are not part of the TOE. No security functional
                          requirements are claimed on AES CCM, HMAC, HKDF, ECDAA, elliptic curve
                          cryptography based on Edwards and Montgomery curves and FIPS self-tests, they are
                          TSF non-interfering.

                                                                                • SmartCard product delivery to the SmartCard end-user,
                                                                                  and the end of life process.
                                                                                • applets may be loaded onto the chip.

                      The evaluation process is limited to phases 1 to 5. User Applet development is outside
                      the scope of this evaluation. Applets can be loaded into FLASH in phases 3, 4, 5, and 6.
                      Applet loading in phase 7 is also allowed. This means post-issuance loading of applets
                      can be done for a certified TOE.
                      The Configuration Module is loaded into FLASH and has special privileges to personalize
                      and configure the TOE. Before life cycle Phase 7 "Operational Use" the Configuration
                      Module is deleted and hence it is ensured that its functionality cannot be used
                      afterwards. It is possible to load patch code into FLASH in phases 3, 4, 5, and 6. The
                      certification is only valid for the ROM code having the Platform Identifiers and the Patch
                      IDs (if applicable) as stated in Table 5 "Delivery Items".
                      The delivery process from NXP to their customers (to phase 4 or phase 5 of the life
                      cycle) guarantees that the customer is aware of the exact versions of the different parts
                      of the TOE as outlined above.

                         TOE documentation is delivered in electronic form (encrypted according to defined
                         mailing procedures).
                         Note: Phases 1 to 3 are under the TOE developer scope of control. Therefore, the
                         objectives for the environment related to phase 1 to 3 are covered by Assurance
                         measures, which are materialized by documents and procedures evaluated through the
                         TOE evaluation process.
                         During phases 4 to 7 the TOE is no more under the developer control. In this
                         environment, the TOE protects itself with its own Security functions. But some additional
                         usage procedures must also be followed in order to ensure that the TOE is correctly
                         and securely handled, and not damaged or comprised. This ST assumes (A.USE_
                         DIAG, A.USE_KEYS) that users handle securely the TOE and related Objectives for the
                         environment are defined (OE.USE_DIAG, OE.USE_KEYS).

                 1.3.5.2 TOE Identification

                         The TOE can be identified by using the Platform ID, the FLASH ID and the Patch ID. The
                         IDENTIFY command and the identification output for this TOE are described in detail
                         in Chapter 2 of the UGM [9]. The IDENTIFY command also returns information about
                         presence of optional functionality and allows to identify the IOT Full and IOT Reduced
                         base mask configuration.

                  1.3.6 Evaluated Package Types
                         A number of package types are supported for this TOE. All package types, which are
                         covered by the certification of the used hardware (see [10]), are also allowed to be used
                         in combination with each product of this TOE.
                         The package types do not influence the security functionality of the TOE. They only
                         define which pads are connected in the package and for what purpose and in which
                         environment the chip can be used. Note that the security of the TOE is not dependent on

2       Conformance Claims (ASE_CCL)
                      This Chapter is divided into the following sections: "CC Conformance Claim", "Package
                      Claim", "PP Claim", and "Conformance Claim Rationale".

                  2.1 CC Conformance Claim
                      This Security Target claims to be conformant to version 3.1 of Common Criteria for
                      Information Technology Security Evaluation according to
                      • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 1, Version 3.1,
                        Revision 5, April 2017" [1]
                      • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 2, Version 3.1,
                        Revision 5, April 2017" [2]
                      • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 3, Version 3.1,
                        Revision 5, April 2017" [3]
                      The following methodology will be used for the evaluation:
                      • Common Methodology for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Evaluation
                        Methodology, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April 2017" [4]
                      This Security Target claims to be CC Part 2 extended and CC Part 3 conformant.
                      The extended Security Functional Requirements are defined in Section 6 "Extended
                      Components Definition (ASE_ECD)".

                  2.2 Package Claim
                      This Security Target claims conformance to the assurance package EAL6. The
                      augmentation to EAL6 is ASE_TSS.2 “TOE summary specification with architectural
                      design summary” and ALC_FLR.1 “Basic flaw remediation”.

                  2.3 PP Claim
                      The Security Target claims demonstrable conformance to the Java Card System -
                      Open Configuration Protection Profile, December 2017, Version 3.0.5 [6], certified by
                      Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI, BSI-CC-PP-0099-2017). The
                      Java Card Protection Profile makes the use of Java Card RMI optional. The TOE does
                      not support Java Card RMI. This ST is more restrictive than the PP [6] which Section 2.4
                      "Conformance Claim Rationale" provides a rational for.

                  2.4 Conformance Claim Rationale

                 2.4.1 TOE Type
                      The TOE type as stated in Section Section 1.2 "TOE Overview" of this ST corresponds
                      to the TOE type of the PP as stated in Section 2.1 of [6] namely a Java Card platform,
                      implementing the Java Card Specification Version 3.0.5 [15], [16], [14].

                 2.4.2.1 Threats

                         The Security Problem Definition (SPD) statement that is presented in Section 4 "Security
                         Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)" includes the threats as presented in the PP [6], but also
                         includes additional threats. These threats are:
                         •   T.OS_OPERATE
                         •   T.RND
                         •   T.COM_EXPLOIT
                         •   T.LIFE_CYCLE
                         •   T.UNAUTHORIZED_CARD_MNGT
                         •   T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA[REFINED]
                         •   T.CONFIG
                         •   T.SEC_BOX_BORDER
                         •   T.MODULE_EXEC
                         •   T.MODULE_REPLACEMENT
                         The threat T.OS_OPERATE is an additional threat added to cover incorrect operating
                         system behavior, it is an addition to the threats in the PP [6].
                         The threat T.RND is taken from the Security IC PP [5].
                         The threat T.COM_EXPLOIT is included to cover communication channels attacks and it
                         is an addition to the threats in the PP [6].
                         The threat T.LIFE_CYCLE is included to cover content management attacks and it is an
                         addition to the threats in the PP [6].
                         The threat T.UNAUTHORIZED_CARD_MNGT refines the threats T.INSTALL and
                         T.DELETION from the Security IC PP [5].
                         The threat T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA[REFINED] refines the threat T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA in
                         the Security IC PP [5].
                         The threat T.CONFIG is an additional threat to cover unauthorized modifications and
                         read access of the configuration area in the TOE. It is an addition to the threats defined in
                         the PP [6].
                         The threat T.SEC_BOX_BORDER is included for the Secure Box which is additional
                         functionality the PP [6] allows.
                         The threats T.MODULE_EXEC and T.MODULE_REPLACEMENT are included for the
                         Modular Design which is additional functionality the PP [6] allows. Furthermore some
                         threats from the PP [6] are refined to cover additional assets from the Modular Design.
                         This comprises threats T.CONFID-JCS-CODE, T.CONFID-JCS-DATA, T.INTEG-APPLI-
                         CODE, T.INTEG-JCS-CODE, T.INTEG-JCS-DATA, and T.SID.1.
                         Note that the threat T.EXE-CODE-REMOTE is not included, since the TOE does not
                         support Java Card RMI. The Java Card Protection Profile [6] makes the use of Java Card
                         RMI optional.

    2.4         TOE Overview

2.4.1               TOE Definition
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) addressed by this ST is an electronic passport representing a smart card
implementing [ICAO_9303_10], [ICAO_9303_11], [TR-03110_1] and [TR-03110_3]. This smart card / passport
provides the following application:
     the travel document containing the related user data as well as data needed for authentication with BAC,
     PACE, EAC or AA protocols (incl. PACE/BAC passwords); this application is intended to be used by
     governmental organisations as a machine readable travel document (MRTD).
For the ePassport application, the travel document holder can control access to his user data by conscious
presenting his travel document to governmental organisations.The travel document’s chip is integrated into a
physical (plastic or paper), optically readable part of the travel document, which – as the final product – shall
eventually supersede still existing, merely optically readable travel documents. The plastic or paper, optically
readable cover of the travel document, where the travel document’s chip is embedded in, is not part of the
TOE. The tying-up of the travel document’s chip to the plastic travel document is achieved by physical and
organizational security measures being out of scope of the TOE.

2.4.2               TOE Operational Usage
A State or Organization issues MRTDs to be used by the holder for international travel. The traveler presents a
MRTD to the inspection system to prove his or her identity. The MRTD in context of this ST contains (i) visual
(eye readable) biographical data and portrait of the holder, (ii) a separate data summary (MRZ data) for visual
and machine reading using OCR methods (see [ICAO_9303_01]) in the Machine readable zone (MRZ) and (iii)
data elements on the MRTD’s chip. The authentication of the traveller is based on (i) the possession of a valid
travel document personalised for a holder with the claimed identity as given on the biographical data page and
(ii) biometrics using the reference data stored in the travel document. The issuing State or Organisation ensures
the authenticity of the data of genuine travel documents. The receiving State trusts a genuine travel document
of an issuing State or Organisation.

2.4.3               TOE Major Security Features
The following TOE security features are the most significant for its operational use:
    Verifying authenticity and integrity as well as securing confidentiality of user data in the communication
     channel between the TOE and the connected terminal supporting the protocols BAC, SAC(PACE) as per
     [ICAO_9303_11] and EAC as per [TR-03110_1]
    Averting of inconspicuous tracing of the travel document as per [TR-03110_1]
    Self-protection of the TOE security functionality and the data stored inside as per [TR-03110_1]
    Means to check authenticity of the terminal, Terminal Authentication as per [TR-03110_1]
    Means to prove authenticity of the chip by means of Active Authentication or Chip Authentication as per [TR-
     03110_1]
    Chip authentication followed by terminal authentication used as a precondition to provide access to

 2.6              TOE Description

2.6.1               Component Overview
The TOE is a DI chip with the ePassport configuration of SECORA™ ID S Infineon Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0.
It is based on the requirements from the ICAO for machine readable travel documents, i.e. [ICAO_9303_10],
[ICAO_9303_11], [TR-03110_1] and [TR-03110_3].
Figure 1 shows the TOE in terms of its components.
The grey color indicates what contributes to fulfill the security claims in this ST. The white color indicates
optional components which are not in the scope of the security claims of this ST, in CC terminology these are
non interefering with the TSF of the TOE.
   -    The two lower layers in the picture represent the smart card controller referenced by IFX_CCI_000005
        together with the Firmware, Asymmetric Cryptographic Library (ACL) and a Symmetric Crypto Library
        (SCL). Note that these components are certified by the same CC certificate BSI-DSZ-CC-1110-V2-2019.
        The hardware platform provides effective protection mechanisms against fault attacks. The platform
        contains hardware co-processors, which support cryptographic standards such as TDES, AES, RSA and
        EC. The hardware co-processor SCP has integrated measures against successful SCA.
   -    The OS platform called “Secora ID S” is a Java Card OS and offers services for:
                 The standard Java Card features like API, the Java Card Runtime Environment and the Java
                  Card Virtual Machine
               Proprietary PACE API providing special countermeasures against side channel leakage
               GP for content management
               Crypto operations (hash, EC, RSA, TDES and AES)
               Communication via the contactless interface and contact interface.
        It is certified in Common Criteria under the Certificate NSCIB-CC-175887.
        Secora ID S supports the standard open Java Card mode as well as the proprietary static mode
        (installation of preloaded code is possible) and the proprietary mode native (specially tailored mode for
        eMRTD usecase which enforces non traceablity of the TOE). Open and static modes are the two possible

       modes during personalization of the TOE. The TOE goes into native mode once the personalization is
       terminated. See [ST_JC_ID_S_Platform] for more details on the supported modes in Secora ID S OS.
   -   ISO or EU Electronic Driving License (eDL) or an Electronic ID(eID) are configurations of SECORA™ ID S
       Applet Infineon Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0. For more information on these optional features refer
       to [UserGuideDataBook], [UserGuideAdmin]. As already said these applications are not part of the TOE
       Security Functionalities and are non interfering with the TSFs of the TOE. The installation of eDL and
       eID is done by the customer who uses the cap file of SECORA™ ID S Applet Infineon Applet Collection
       preloaded on the card by Infineon. Again, no claims of the security for the eDL or the eID applications
       are made in this ST.
   -   ePassport configuration of SECORA™ ID S Applet Infineon Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0 is a Java Card
       applet which provides the functions of the electronic Passport as per [ICAO_9303_10], [ICAO_9303_11],
       [TR-03110_1] and [TR-03110_3].
       The installation of ePass is done by the customer who uses for this purpose the cap file of SECORA™ ID
       S Applet Infineon Applet Collection preloaded on the card by Infineon.
       The applet uses the services of the Java Card Secora ID S OS described above. It manages the various
       stages of the product’s lifecycle once the application is onto the hardware up to its end of life. The
       application implements the protocols:
                 BAC
                 PACE
                 EAC
                 AA
       It does not implement any cryptographic primitives, as these are provided by the underlying Java Card
       OS. Further it manages file access control and authentication failure handling. Also the application
       controls the secure messaging including error handling using the Java Card OS Crypto services, which
       subsequently relies on the features of the underlying hardware providing high integrity and side
       channel protection. The claims in terms of SFRs in this ST target the SECORA™ ID S Applet Infineon
       Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0.

   -   Third party applications can be installed by the customer and running on the card. Note that in this
       case the JC Secora ID S is delivered in open mode, see [ST_JC_ID_S_Platform] to the customer which
       will be then able to load and install 3rd party applications.
The TOE user guidance comprises:
   -   [UserGuideDataBook] and [UserGuideAdmin] which provide guidance, how to perform personalization
       and maintain the targeted security level during Personalisation and Operation phase.

Figure 1      TOE components overview




2.6.2              Interfaces of the TOE
   -    The physical interface of the TOE to the external environment is the entire surface of the IC.
   -    The RF interface (radio frequency power and signal interface) enabling contactless communication
        between a PICC (proximity integration chip card, PICC) and a terminal reader/writer (proximity coupling
        device, terminal). The transmission protocol meets [ISO/IEC 14443-3] and [ISO/IEC 14443-4] Type B.
   -    The contact based interface ISO 7816-3 supported for the purposes of eID and eDL.
   -    The command interface to the TOE is provided by the ePassport Application.



2.6.3              Package Types
The TOE package types and formats are exactly the same as for the underlying Java Card OS. The package
types and formats of the Java Card OS Secora ID S are described in [ST_JC_ID_S_Platform], section 1.4.3 and
1.4.6.


2.6.4              Lifecycle and Delivery
The [PP_EAC], [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC] define the lifecycle phases for the TOE as follows:
1. Development
   - Step 1: Development of hardware and IC dedicated software (firmware)
   - Step 2: Development of IC embedded software

2. Manufacturing
   - Step 3: manufacturing of IC and IC dedicated software. As the TOE does not provide any user ROM,
       manufacturing of IC embedded software parts in ROM are not relevant here.
   - Step 4 (optional): Combination of IC with contactless interface of the travel document
   - Step 5 (Prepersonalization): loading on the device of the executable Java Card OS image. Loading of
       the application JC package containing the TOE code, eDL and eID code.
3. Personalisation of Travel Document
   - Step 6: this step is performed by the customer. The customer receives from Infineon the TOE
       composed of the following components:
           o The underlying hardware
           o The underlying Java Card OS can be in two possible modes: either in the standard Java Card
                open mode (loading and installation of applets are possible) or in the proprietary Java Card
                static mode (preloaded by Infineon packages can be installed, applet loading is not possible).
           o The cap file of SECORA™ ID S Applet Infineon Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0 is preloaded by
                Infineon.
           o The customer then proceeds to installing the ePassport configuration of SECORA™ ID S Infineon
                Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0 and optionally installing the ISO/EU eDL or eID. In case the
                Secora ID S is in open mode the customer can load and install 3rd party applets. During this step
                the customer also performs the personalisation with biometric data and configuration of the
                TSF if necessary.
4. Operational Use
   - Step 7: once the personalization of the product is finished, the Java Card ID S OS is switched to its
       proprietary native mode usage of the TOE by the personalizer. Native mode switches off GP and
       identification commands to disallow tracking of the end user.

  7             Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)

  7.1           TOE Security Functional Requirements
 The security functional requirements (SFR) for this TOE are defined in this chapter.
This ST covers the three PPs [PP_SAC], [PP_EAC] and [PP_BAC] each two of which have a non empty
intersection of SFRs. In the rest of this section we provide a classification of the SFRs of these PPs depending on
where these SFRs are declared and if they need a refinement here in this ST.
 Table 1 lists all SFRs appearing both in [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC].
 Table 2 lists all SFRs declared in [PP_SAC].
Table 3 lists all SFRs specific to [PP_BAC]. Note that some of the SFRs appear in both [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC]
with same name but different content. In such cases the SFR is iterated with either the extension …/BAC or
…/PACE.
Table 4 lists all SFRs specific to [PP_EAC]. Note that [PP_EAC] is an extension of [PP_SAC], therefore all SFRs of
[PP_SAC] are SFRs in [PP_EAC], i.e. the SFRs listed in Table 3 and Table 4 are also SFRs of [PP_EAC].
Table 5 lists the SFRs introduced in this ST which are related to the Active Authentication mechanism
supported by the TOE.

7.1.1                About the Application Notes in this ST
Note that if an SFR has application notes as per the PPs [PP_SAC], [PP_EAC] and [PP_BAC] then these
application notes apply and can be found in the respective PPs.
Some SFRs contain additional application notes to ease the understanding of the specificities of this TOE.
These application notes do not come from the PPs and are prefixed with [IFX specific].



7.1.2                Common SFRs from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC]

7.1.2.1              Class FCS: Cryptographic Support




  FCS_CKM.4                Cryptographic key destruction – Session keys

  Hierarchical to:         No other components.

  Dependencies:            [FDP_ITC.1 Import of user data without security attributes, or FDP_ITC.2 Import of
                           user data with security attributes, or FCS_CKM.1 Cryptographic key generation]:
                           fulfilled by FCS_CKM.1 in case of BAC;
                           fulfilled by FCS_CKM.1/DH_PACE in case of PACE

  FCS_CKM.4.1              The TSF shall destroy cryptographic keys in accordance with a specified
                           cryptographic key destruction method overwriting the key values with random
                           values that meets the following: none

                           Application note 19 of [PP_BAC] and application note 28 of [PP_SAC] are both
 [IFX specific]            applicable for this SFR. There is no contradiction between the two application
 Application Note:         notes. While the application note from [PP_BAC] simply requests the encryption
                           and message authentication keys to be destroyed, the application note from
                           [PP_SAC] provides more detailed requests, when the session keys have to be
                           destroyed. Therefore FCS_CKM.4 from [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC] can be combined.

 FCS_RND.1                Quality metric for random numbers

 Hierarchical to:         No other components.

 Dependencies:            No dependencies.

 FCS_RND.1.1              The TSF shall provide a mechanism to generate random numbers that meet
                          Random numbers generation Class PTG.3 according to [AIS31]

 [IFX specific]           There is no contradiction between application note 24 of [PP_BAC] and application
 Application Note:        note 31 of [PP_SAC]. Both application notes shall apply and therefore FCS_RND.1
                          from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be combined, i.e. the random numbers shall be
                          used for the PACE, BAC and the authentication mechanism based on Triple-DES (as
                          defined in FIA_UAU.4/PACE and FIA_UAU.4).




7.1.2.2             Class FMT Security Management

                          PACE; fulfilled by FMT_SMF.1/BAC for BAC
                          FMT_SMR.1 Security roles: fulfilled by FMT_SMR.1/PACE for PACE; fulfilled by
                          FMT_SMR.1 for BAC

 FMT_MTD.1.1/INI_ENA      The TSF shall restrict the ability to write the Initialisation Data and Pre-
                          personalisation Data to the Manufacturer.

 [IFX specific]           The application note 42 of [PP_BAC] applies. This application note provides a
 Application Note:        definition, what is meant by “Pre-Personalisation Data”. This definition is also
                          applicable to FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA from [PP_SAC]. Therefore FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA
                          from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be combined.

7.1.2.3             Class FPT Protection of the Security Functions


 FPT_TST.1                TSF testing

 Hierarchical to:         No other components.

 Dependencies:            No dependencies.

 FPT_TST.1.1              The TSF shall run a suite of self tests during initial start-up, to demonstrate the
                          correct operation of the TSF.

 FPT_TST.1.2              The TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to verify the integrity of
                          the TSF data.

 FPT_TST.1.3              The TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to verify the integrity of
                          stored TSF executable code.



 [IFX specific]           There is no contradiction between application note 46 of [PP_BAC] and application
                          note 52 of [PP_SAC]. In fact, although the wording is slightly different, the meaning
 Application Note:
                          of these application notes is identical. Therefore either of these application notes
                          applies and FPT_TST.1 from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be combined.




 FPT_PHP.3                Resistance to physical attack

 Hierarchical to:         No other components.

 Dependencies:            No dependencies.

 FPT_PHP.3.1              The TSF shall resist physical manipulation and physical probing to the TSF by
                          responding automatically such that the SFRs are always enforced.

 [IFX specific]           Application note 47 of [PP_BAC] and 53 of [PP_SAC] are equivalent. Application
                          note 48 of [PP_BAC] is only informative to the reader in the sense, that it provides a
 Application Note:
                          context to an older CC standard, but not relevant for the interpretation of
                          FPT_PHP.3. Therefore either application note 47 of [PP_BAC] or application note 53
                          of [PP_SAC] applies and FPT_PHP.3 from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be combined.

4       Security Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)
                       The Security Problem Definition is described within the following sections. Only additional
                       and refined items compared to the PP [6] are described.

                  4.1 Assets
                       Assets are security-relevant elements to be directly protected by the TOE. Confidentiality
                       of assets is always intended with respect to un-trusted people or software, as various
                       parties are involved during the first stages of the smart card product life-cycle. Details
                       concerning the threats are given in Section 4.2 "Threats" hereafter.
                       Assets have to be protected, some in terms of confidentiality and some in terms of
                       integrity or both integrity and confidentiality. These assets might get compromised by the
                       threats that the TOE is exposed to.
                       The assets to be protected by the TOE are listed below. They are grouped according to
                       whether it is data created by and for the user (User data) or data created by and for the
                       TOE (TSF data). This definition of grouping is taken from Section 5.1 of [6].

                  4.2.4 Operating System

                 4.2.4.1 T.OS_OPERATE: Incorrect Operating System Behavior

                        Modification of the correct OS behavior by unauthorized use of TOE or use of incorrect
                        or unauthorized instructions or commands or sequence of commands, in order to obtain
                        an unauthorized execution of the TOE code. An attacker may cause a malfunction of TSF
                        or of the Smart Card embedded OS in order to (1) by-pass the security mechanisms (i.e.
                        authentication or access control mechanisms) or (2) obtain unexpected result from the
                        embedded OS behavior. Different kind of attack path may be used as:
                        1. Applying incorrect unexpected or unauthorized instructions, commands or command
                           sequences,
                        2. Provoking insecure state by insertion of interrupt (reset), premature termination of
                           transaction or communication between IC and the reading device.
                        Info: Any implementation flaw in the OS itself can be exploited with this attack path
                        to lead to an unsecured state of the state machine of the OS. The attacker uses the
                        available interfaces of the TOE. A user could have certain specified privileges that allow
                        loading of selected programs. Unauthorized programs, if allowed to be loaded, may
                        include either the execution of legitimate programs not intended for use during normal
                        operation (such as patches, filters, Trojan horses, etc.) or the unauthorized loading of
                        programs specifically targeted at penetration or modification of the security functions.
                        Attempts to generate a non-secure state in the Smart Card may also be made through
                        premature termination of transactions or communications between the IC and the card
                        reading device, by insertion of interrupts, or by selecting related applications that may
                        leave files open.

                  4.2.5 Random Numbers

                 4.2.5.1 T.RND: Deficiency of Random Numbers

                        An attacker may predict or obtain information about random numbers generated by
                        the TOE for instance because of a lack of entropy of the random numbers provided.
                        An attacker may gather information about the produced random numbers which might
                        be a problem because they may be used for instance to generate cryptographic keys.
                        Here the attacker is expected to take advantage of statistical properties of the random
                        numbers generated by the TOE without specific knowledge about the TOE’s generator.
                        Malfunctions or premature ageing are also considered which may assist in getting
                        information about random numbers.

                        instantiation of the TOE carries this identification.

                  4.3.2 OSP.KEY-CHANGE: Security Domain Keys Change
                        The Application Provider (AP) shall change its initial security domain keys (APSD) before
                        any operation on its Security Domain.

                  4.3.3 OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS: Security Domains
                        Security domains can be dynamically created, deleted and blocked during usage phase
                        in post-issuance mode.

                  4.3.4 OSP.SECURE-BOX: Secure Box Border
                        Execution of untrusted native code shall be possible without any harm, manipulation, or
                        influence on other parts of the TOE.

                   4.4 Assumptions
                        Note that the assumption A.DELETION is excluded. The Card Manager is part of the
                        TOE and therefore the assumption is no longer relevant.

                  4.4.1 A.USE_DIAG: Usage of TOE’s Secure Communication Protocol by OE
                        It is assumed that the operational environment supports and uses the secure
                        communication protocols offered by the TOE.

                 4.4.2 A.USE_KEYS: Protected Storage of Keys Outside of TOE
                       It is assumed that the keys which are stored outside the TOE and which are used for
                       secure communication and authentication between Smart Card and terminals are
                       protected for confidentiality and integrity in their own storage environment. This is
                       especially true for D.APSD_KEYS, D.ISD_KEYS, and D.VASD_KEYS.
                       Info: This is to assume that the keys used in terminals or systems are correctly
                       protected for confidentiality and integrity in their own environment, as the disclosure of
                       such information which is shared with the TOE but is not under the TOE control, may
                       compromise the security of the TOE.

                 4.4.3 A.PROCESS-SEC-IC: Protection during Packaging, Finishing and
                       Personalisation
                       It is assumed that security procedures are used after delivery of the TOE by the TOE
                       Manufacturer up to delivery to the end consumer to maintain confidentiality and integrity
                       of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test e PACE protocol shall be verified as being sent
                          by the PACE terminal.

                          FMT_MSA.3 Static attribute initialisation: not fulfilled, but justified
                          The access control TSF according to FDP_ACF.1/TRM uses security attributes
                          having been defined during the personalisation and fixed over the whole life time
                          of the TOE. No management of these security attributes (i.e. SFR FMT_MSA.1 and
                          FMT_MSA.3) is necessary here.

 FDP_ACF.1.1/TRM          The TSF shall enforce the Access Control SFP to objects based on the following:
                          1. Subjects:
                                                      a) Terminal,

                                                      b) data in EF.DG3 of the logical travel document,
                                                      c) data in EF.DG4 of the logical travel document
                          3. Security attributes:

                          4. none



 FDP_ACF.1.2/TRM          The TSF shall enforce the following rules to determine if an operation among
                          controlled subjects and controlled objects is allowed:
                          1. A BIS-PACE is allowed to read data objects from FDP_ACF.1/TRM according to
                             [ICAO_SAC] after a successful PACE authentication as required by
                             FIA_UAU.1/PACE.

 FDP_ACF.1.3/TRM          The TSF shall explicitly authorise access of subjects to objects based on the
                          following additional rules: none

 FDP_ACF.1.4/TRM          The TSF shall explicitly deny access of subjects to objects based on the following
                          additional rules:
                          1. Any terminal being not authenticated as PACE authenticated BIS-PACE is not
                             allowed to read, to write, to modify, to use any User Data stored on the travel
                             document.
                          2. Terminals not using secure messaging are not allowed to read, to write, to
                             modify, to use any data stored on the travel document
                          3. None

Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)


7.1.1.2        FAU_SAS
During testing at the end of Phase 3 before TOE Delivery, the TOE shall be able to store some data (for instance
about the production history or identification data of the individual die or other data to be used after delivery).
Therefore, the security functional component Audit storage (FAU_SAS.1) has been added and is described in the
PP [9].
The TOE shall meet the requirement “Audit storage (FAU_SAS.1)” as specified below, PP [9]:

reader/writer (proximity coupling
        device, terminal). The transmission protocol meets [ISO/IEC 14443-3] and [ISO/IEC 14443-4] Type B.
   -    The contact based interface ISO 7816-3 supported for the purposes of eID and eDL.
   -    The command interface to the TOE is provided by the ePassport Application.



2.6.3              Package Types
The TOE package types and formats are exactly the same as for the underlying Java Card OS. The package
types and formats of the Java Card OS Secora ID S are described in [ST_JC_ID_S_Platform], section 1.4.3 and
1.4.6.


2.6.4              Lifecycle and Delivery
The [PP_EAC], [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC] define the lifecycle phases for the TOE as follows:
1. Development
   - Step 1: Development of hardware and IC dedicated software (firmware)
   - Step 2: Development of IC embedded software

ePassport configuration of SECORA™ ID S Infineon Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0



2. Manufacturing
   - Step 3: manufacturing of IC and IC dedicated software. As the TOE does not provide any user ROM,
       manufacturing of IC embedded software parts in ROM are not relevant here.
   - Step 4 (optional): Combination of IC with contactless interface of the travel document
   - Step 5 (Prepersonalization): loading on the device of the executable Java Card OS image. Loading of
       the application JC package containing the TOE code, eDL and eID code.
3. Personalisation of Travel Document
   - Step 6: this step is performed by the customer. The customer receives from Infineon the TOE
       composed of the following components:
           o The underlying hardware
           o The underlying Java Card OS can be in two possible modes: either in the standard Java Card
                open mode (loading and installation of applets are possible) or in the proprietary Java Card
                static mode (preloaded by Infineon packages can be installed, applet loading is not possible).
           o The cap file of SECORA™ ID S Applet Infineon Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0 is preloaded by
                Infineon.
           o The customer then proceeds to installing the ePassport configuration of SECORA™ ID S Infineon
                Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0 and optionally installing the ISO/EU eDL or eID. In case the
                Secora ID S is in open mode the customer can load and install 3rd party applets. During this step
                the customer also performs the personalisation with biometric data and configuration of the
                TSF if necessary.
4. Operational Use
   - Step 7: once the personalization of the product is finished, the Java Card ID S OS is switched to its

  7             Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)

  7.1           TOE Security Functional Requirements
 The security functional requirements (SFR) for this TOE are defined in this chapter.
This ST covers the three PPs [PP_SAC], [PP_EAC] and [PP_BAC] each two of which have a non empty
intersection of SFRs. In the rest of this section we provide a classification of the SFRs of these PPs depending on
where these SFRs are declared and if they need a refinement here in this ST.
 Table 1 lists all SFRs appearing both in [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC].
 Table 2 lists all SFRs declared in [PP_SAC].
Table 3 lists all SFRs specific to [PP_BAC]. Note that some of the SFRs appear in both [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC]
with same name but different content. In such cases the SFR is iterated with either the extension …/BAC or
…/PACE.
Table 4 lists all SFRs specific to [PP_EAC]. Note that [PP_EAC] is an extension of [PP_SAC], therefore all SFRs of
[PP_SAC] are SFRs in [PP_EAC], i.e. the SFRs listed in Table 3 and Table 4 are also SFRs of [PP_EAC].
Table 5 lists the SFRs introduced in this ST which are related to the Active Authentication mechanism
supported by the TOE.

7.1.1                About the Application Notes in this ST
Note that if an SFR has application notes as per the PPs [PP_SAC], [PP_EAC] and [PP_BAC] then these
application notes apply and can be found in the respective PPs.
Some SFRs contain additional application notes to ease the understanding of the specificities of this TOE.
These application notes do not come from the PPs and are prefixed with [IFX specific].

 Application Note:         notes. While the application note from [PP_BAC] simply requests the encryption
                           and message authentication keys to be destroyed, the application note from
                           [PP_SAC] provides more detailed requests, when the session keys have to be
                           destroyed. Therefore FCS_CKM.4 from [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC] can be combined.

 [IFX specific]           There is no contradiction between application note 46 of [PP_BAC] and application
                          note 52 of [PP_SAC]. In fact, although the wording is slightly different, the meaning
 Application Note:
                          of these application notes is identical. Therefore either of these application notes
                          applies and FPT_TST.1 from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be combined.




 FPT_PHP.3                Resistance to physical attack

 Hierarchical to:         No other components.

 [IFX specific]           Application note 47 of [PP_BAC] and 53 of [PP_SAC] are equivalent. Application

and against download of malicious software before, during and after the user downloads his software. This is
formalized with the objectives O.Cap_Avail_Loader, O.Authentication and O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader requiring
authentication of the TOE to external entities and a trusted communication channel. The O.Authentication
implements a mutual authentication and involves the environment therefore.
And the policies cover also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must be
regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.
The implemented mutual authentication requires first to authenticate the TOE to the external user. This requires
also knowledge by the user about the sequence of the protocol, interpretation of the transferred data and how to
start the authentication of the TOE. This authentication mean counters the threat T.Masquerade_TOE as only
the genuine TOE is able to identify itself correctly to the enabled user, which covers O.Authentication.
The second step of the mutual authentications mean implements the authentication of the user to the TOE. Only
the user enabled to present the correct authentication data and knowing about the sequence, data
interpretation and signaling of the authentication to the TOE is able to proceed further on.
This enforces OE.TOE_Auth, requiring the support of the verification mechanism and known authentication
reference data by the operational environment.

It is normal business that products enabled for software download by the user are either on their way to the user
or are already stored at user premises. At both situations it cannot be excluded that an attacker could manage to
steal such products enabled for software downloads. The ability to download software on a chip without
operating system and/or application is defined as open sample.
This situation generates the threat T.Open_Samples_Diffusion which is defined as follows:
The download of analysis software could enable an attacker to characterize the product and to construct an
attack path out of the gained information.
This threat is countered by the Flash Loader by following rational:
As long as the Flash Loader is active, controlled usage to the Flash Loader functionality (P.Ctrl_Loader) is
enforced which protects the TOE from achieving the status of being an open sample. And more, even the
attacker could observe, meaning in the sense of measurements during, or induce faults during an authorized
download, the Flash Loader protects the user data of the download by confidentiality and integrity protection
means. The Flash Loader functionalities of mutual authentication, establishing a dedicated trusted
communication channel, the encryption and integrity protection means cover the objectives
O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality, O.Leak-Inherent and O.Leak-Forced.
The policy P.Ctrl_Loader covers also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1
