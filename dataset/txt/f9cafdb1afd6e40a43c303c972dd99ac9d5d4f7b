A.      Certification

1.      Preliminary Remarks
Under the BSIG1 Act, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) has the task of
issuing certificates for information technology products.
Certification of a product is carried out on the instigation of the vendor or a distributor,
hereinafter called the sponsor.
A part of the procedure is the technical examination (evaluation) of the product according
to the security criteria published by the BSI or generally recognised security criteria.
The evaluation is normally carried out by an evaluation facility recognised by the BSI or by
BSI itself.
The result of the certification procedure is the present Certification Report. This report
contains among others the certificate (summarised assessment) and the detailed
Certification Results.
The Certification Results contain the technical description of the security functionality of
the certified product, the details of the evaluation (strength and weaknesses) and
instructions for the user.

2.      Specifications of the Certification Procedure
The certification body conducts the procedure according to the criteria laid down in the
following:
‚óè   Act on the Federal Office for Information Security1
‚óè   BSI Certification and Approval Ordinance2
‚óè   BSI Schedule of Costs3
‚óè   Special decrees issued by the Bundesministerium des Innern (Federal Ministry of the

3.      Recognition Agreements
In order to avoid multiple certification of the same product in different countries a mutual
recognition of IT security certificates - as far as such certificates are based on ITSEC or
CC - under certain conditions was agreed.

3.1.    European Recognition of CC ‚Äì Certificates (SOGIS-MRA)
The SOGIS-Mutual Recognition Agreement (SOGIS-MRA) Version 3 became effective in
April 2010. It defines the recognition of certificates for IT-Products at a basic recognition
level and, in addition, at higher recognition levels for IT-Products related to certain SOGIS
Technical Domains only.
The basic recognition level includes Common Criteria (CC) Evaluation Assurance Levels
EAL 1 to EAL 4. For "Smartcards and similar devices" a SOGIS Technical Domain is in
place. For "HW Devices with Security Boxes" a SOGIS Technical Domains is in place, too.
In addition, certificates issued for Protection Profiles based on Common Criteria are part of
the recognition agreement.
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes, details on
recognition, and the history of the agreement can be seen on the website at
https://www.sogisportal.eu.
The SOGIS-MRA logo printed on the certificate indicates that it is recognised under the
terms of this agreement by the related bodies of the signatory nations. A disclaimer
beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of recognition.
This certificate is recognized under SOGIS-MRA for all assurance components selected.

3.2.    International Recognition of CC ‚Äì Certificates (CCRA)
The international arrangement on the mutual recognition of certificates based on the CC
(Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement, CCRA-2014) has been ratified on 08
September 2014. It covers CC certificates based on collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP)
(exact use), CC certificates based on assurance components up to and including EAL 2 or
the assurance family Flaw Remediation (ALC_FLR) and CC certificates for Protection
Profiles and for collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP).
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes can be seen on
the website: https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org.
The Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement logo printed on the certificate indicates
that this certification is recognised under the terms of this agreement by the related bodies
of the signatory nations. A disclaimer beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of
recognition.
This certificate is recognized according to the rules of CCRA-2014, i. e. up to and including
CC part 3 EAL 2+ ALC_FLR components.

4.      Performance of Evaluation and Certification
The certification body monitors each individual evaluation to ensure a uniform procedure, a
uniform interpretation of the criteria and uniform ratings.
The product NXP Secure Smart Card Controller N7021 VA including IC Dedicated
Software has undergone the certification procedure at BSI. This is a re-certification based
on BSI-DSZ-CC-0977-2017. Specific results from the evaluation process BSI-DSZ-CC-
0977-2017 were re-used.
The evaluation of the product NXP Secure Smart Card Controller N7021 VA including IC
Dedicated Software was conducted by T√úV Ihis certification procedure was carried out as a re-
evaluation based on the certificate BSI-DSZ-CC-0977-2017, re-use of specific evaluation
tasks was possible. The focus of this re-evaluation was on the life cycle and updates in the
documentation of the TOE.
The evaluation has confirmed:

9.2.     Results of cryptographic assessment
The strength of the cryptographic algorithms was not rated in the course of this certification
procedure (see BSIG Section 9, Para. 4, Clause 2). But cryptographic functionalities with a
security level of lower than 100 bits can no longer be regarded as secure without
considering the application context. Therefore, for these functionalities it shall be checked
whether the related crypto operations are appropriate for the intended system. Some
further hints and guidelines can be derived from the 'Technische Richtlinie BSI TR-02102'
(https://www.bsi.bund.de).
The following table gives an overview of the cryptographic functionalities inside the TOE to
enforce the security policy and outlines its rating from cryptographic point of view. Any
Cryptographic Functionality that is marked in column 'Security Level above 100 Bits' of the
following table with 'no' achieves a security level of lower than 100 Bits (in general context)
only.

1.3 TOE Overview
The Security Target (ST) defines the security objectives and requirements for a
contact or contactless based chip of machine readable travel documents (MRTD)
based on the requirements and recommendations of the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO), EU requirements for biometric European passport
(Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 and Commission Implementing Decision
6181) and Biometric European Resident Permit (REGULATION (EU) 2017/1954
and Commission Implementing Decision 6178). This product is intended to
enable verification of the authenticity of the travel document and to identify its
holder during a border control, using an inspection system. The verification
process is based on Extended Access Control with Password Authenticated
Connection Establishment (PACE) and optionally Active Authentication (AA).

The main features and their origin are the following:
ÔÇ∑ Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
   according to ICAO Technical Report ‚ÄúSupplemental Access Control‚Äù [ICAO-
   9303] part 11 and strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0068-V2 [PACE-PP] for
   protection of the communication between terminal and chip. The following
   PACE mapping modes are supported and covered by the TOE:
      o    Generic Mapping (PACE-GM)
      o    Integrated Mapping (PACE-IM)
      o    Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM), which combines PACE-GM
           with Chip Authentication into a single protocol.

ÔÇ∑   Chip Authentication v1
    according to BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1], [TR-03110-3] and
    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    travel document‚Äôs chip to the inspection system.
ÔÇ∑   Terminal Authentication v1
    according to BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1], [TR-03110-3] and
    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    inspection system to travel document‚Äôs chip and protects the confidentiality
    and integrity of the sensitive biometric reference data during their
    transmission from the TOE to the inspection system.

As a feature that can be optionally configured the TOE supports:
ÔÇ∑   Active Authentication
    which according to [ICAO-9303] prevents copying the SOD and proves that it
    has been read from the authentic chip. It proves that the chip has not been
    substituted.


ÔÇ∑   Polymorphic Authentication
    which according to [PCA-eMRTD] provides additional privacy by randomisation
    of returned Polymorphic Identities, Polymorphic Pseudonyms and
    Complementary Polymorphic ID attributes in combination with standard ICAO
    and EAC1 eMRTD protocols specified in ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] and BSI
    TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1] and [TR 03110-3].

The TOE may also be used as an ISO driving license, compliant to ISO/IEC 18013
or ISO/IEC TR 19446 supporting PACE, AA and CA, as both applications (MRTD
and IDL) share the same protocols and data structure organization. Therefore, in
the rest of the document, the word ‚ÄúMRTD‚Äù MAY be understood either as a MRTD
in the sense of ICAO, or a driving license compliant to ISO/IEC 18013 or ISO/IEC
TR 19446 depending on the targeted usage envisioned by the issuer.

Application note
This TOE claims an assurance level EAL5 augmented with AVA_VAN.5 and
ALC_DVS.2. AVA_VAN.5 implies that the TOE is resistant to attacks performed by
an attacker possessing "High attack potential".
Not all key sizes specified in this security target have sufficient cryptographic
strength for satisfying the AVA_VAN.5 ‚Äúhigh attack potential‚Äù. In order to be
protected against attackers with a "high attack potential", sufficiently large
cryptographic key sizes SHALL be configured for this TOE. References can be

1.4 TOE Description

1.4.1 TOE Definition
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) addressed by the current security target is an
electronic travel document representing a contactless / contact based smart card
or passport programmed according to Logical data structure (LDS) and protocols
specified in ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] and additionally providing the Extended
Access Control according to BSI TR-03110 part 1 [TR-03110-1] and part 3 [TR-
03110-3] and Active Authentication according to [ICAO-9303]. The
communication between terminal and chip shall be protected by Password
Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE), optionally with Chip
Authentication Mapping (PACE CAM) according to Electronic Passport using
Standard Inspection Procedure with PACE (PACE PP), BSI-CC-PP-0068-V2 [PACE-
PP]. Polymorphic eMRTD extensions are present on the TOE that enable secure
authentication with enhanced privacy protection features. It provides the holder
the possibility to authenticate towards a service provider in a non-traceable and
non-linkable manner thanks to usage of Polymorphic Pseudonyms and other
Polymorphic ID attributes.

The TOE (IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic
eMRTD Configuration)) is composed of
   ÔÇ∑ the NXP JCOP 3 P60, composed of
      o the circuitry of the MRTD‚Äôs chip (NXP Secure Smart Card Controller

1.4.2 TOE usage and security features for operational use
Depending on its configuration during pre-personalisation and personalisation,
the TOE can be used as:
   ÔÇ∑ ICAO/EAC eMRTD,
   ÔÇ∑ Polymorphic eMRTD and
   ÔÇ∑ EU/ISO Driving Licence.

The ICAO/EAC eMRTD, Polymorphic eMRTD and Driver Licence are installed as a
separate application instances of the applet having their own dedicated
application identifiers and personalisation. The following TOE configurations are
covered within the scope of this Security Target:

[TR-03110] have also been refered to in ISO18013 for EU driving licences. The
BAP-1 protocol defined in ISO18013 is equal to Basic Access Protocol (BAC)
defined in [ICAO-9303]. As to the logical data structure, the ISO18013 uses the
same concept of Passive Authentication defined in [ICAO-9303], but specifies
different ISO7816-4 elementary file identifiers for storing the ICAO defined
content of DG3, DG4 and DG15.

Notes for FCS_CKM.1.1/RSA-1 or FCS_CKM.1.1/RSA-2:
1. The function CryptoGeneratePrime has been assigned to the appropriate security level by BSI. The proprietary
CryptoGeneratePrimeMask function has not been cryptographic-analytically evaluated and certified by BSI.
End of note.

2. The minimum key length follows the national recommendations by the BSI which means that RSA key lengths
below 1976 bits are not included in the certificate. The key length requirements can differ between the countries.
Please note that the BSI expects this key length as appropriate until 2022 and recommends for longer usage
times key lengths of 3000 bits or higher.

 7.1.4.5.3     General Preface regarding Elliptic Curve Cryptography
The EC library is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software. The security functional
requirement covers the standard Brainpool [19] and NIST [26] Elliptic Curves with key lengths of 160, 163, 192,
224, 233, 256, 283, 320, 384, 409, 512 or 521 bits. For one part the definition of the key lengths follows the
national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100 bit security level by the BSI. Numerous other curve types, being also
secure in terms of side channel attacks on this TOE, exist, which the user optionally can add in the composition
certification process.
All curves are based on finite field GF(p) with value p —î [241-1; 2521[ as well as curves based on a finite field GF(2n)
with size n —î [41-1; 521] are su SOLID FLASH“π NVM2.
FDP_SDI.2.2                  Upon detection of a data integrity error, the TSF shall correct 1 bit errors in the SOLID
                             FLASH“π NVM automatically and inform the user about other bit errors3.

6.1.7                  Support of Flash Loader
The TOE provides a Flash Loader to download user data into the SOLID FLASH“π NVM, either during production
of the TOE or at customer site. Depending on the configuration option EA the Flash Loader claims different sets
of SFRs. [PP0084] section 7.3.1 ‚ÄúPackage 1: Loader dedicated for usage in secured environment only‚Äù is claimed
for both options. [PP0084] section 7.2 Package ‚ÄúAuthentication of the Security IC‚Äù and [PP0084] section 7.3.2
‚ÄúPackage 2: Loader dedicated for usage by authorized users only‚Äù is only claimed in case TOE is ordered with
EA unavailable, however a subset of SFRs from loader package 2 is also claimed, if TOE is ordered with EA
available.

The key lengths used for the AES and DES functionality follow the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100
bit security level issued by the BSI1. This regulation excludes the single DES operation from the certification as it
is considered to be not sufficiently secure from algorithm perspective.
For both versions, the certification covers the SCL cryptographic functionality of the AES algorithm with key
lengths of 128, 192, 256 bits and the TDEA or TripleDES (TDES) algorithm with an effective key size of 112 and
168 Bits. For the version v2.04.002 the certification covers the CMAC functionality too.

Beside the inclusion and support of cryptographic libraries this TOE comes with the optional Hardware Support
Library (HSL) in different alternative versions significantly simplifying the management of the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢
NVM functionality. The HSL (all versions) constitutes an application interface (API) accessing the HSL state
machine and abstracting low level properties like special function registers and settings of specific hardware

features. In short the HSL provides a user friendly also use case oriented interface considering endurance,
reliability and performance.
All HSL library versions are delivered as object code.
The HSL is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software.
All HSL versions implement, beyond the low level driver, the basic method In-place Update leveraging the
dedicated advantages of the new SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM technology.
In addition to the above, all HSL versions provide an advanced additional method called Incremental Write (IWR).
This method provides enhanced endurance of the SOLID FLASH NVM even beyond the erase endurance limits
for often written objects. Thus this method serves applications with a demand for high endurance and fast
writing times. On the other hand, the read times using this method are slower than the other methods provided.
The HSL versions provide tearing save behavior, whereas we define tearing as an untimed power cut off which
could occur anytime and in the worse therewith could also occur during writing to or erasing of pages in the
SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM.
If the HSL ‚Äì all versions are meant - comes with the TOE and the user implements the offered configuration and
dedicated functions tearing save behaviour of the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM is provided. In these cases the user does
not need to care about tearing events since either the old data or the new data are correctly in place.
In addition to the versions 01.22.4346 and 02.01.6634, the HSLs in versions 03.11.8339 and 03.12.8812 provide a
furthermore improved method for the Incremental Write (IWR).
But, even in the cases where the user decides not to use the HSL and did also not implement own routines
preserving the consistency of the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM, the hardware protection means prevent from operation
of inconsistent data. Therefore, in no cases a tearing event leads to an exploitable situation respectively
vulnerability.
Anyhow, the user should be aware and is recommended to use either the HSL or implement own routines
managing tearing events since if there would occur a faulty programmed SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM location the TOE
ends operation at that point.

The order option CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ Cryptographic Library (CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL) provides cryptographic functionality to
implement a CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ V2 conformant protocol.
This protocol provides a secure mutual authentication of two entities, namely the terminal (denoted as PCD =
Proximity Coupling Device (CIPURSE‚Ñ¢-compliant terminal)) and a smart card or a token in other form factors
which is called PICC. PICC stands for Proximity Integrated Circuit Card (CIPURSE‚Ñ¢-compliant card).
Beside the mutual authentication, the protocol implements measures to maintain the integrity of the after
passing successfully the authentication transferred data. It depends on the chosen operation mode whether the
user requires integrity protection only, for example if the exchange is used in a secure environment only, or
whether complete protection including the encrypted transfer of user data between the two authentication
entities is an issue. Both operation modes are part of the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ open standard and offered as integrity
protection mode and as confidential communication mode.
By that the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL supports the user to implement systems conformant to the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ open standard
implementing a secured, interoperable and flexible transit fare collection solution, including ISO 7816, ISO/IEC
14443-4 communication and AES-128 bit cryptography for multiple payment types.
The CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL is conformant to the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ open standard [18] for both, the PICC and then PCD software
parts. It implements the by the OSPT alliance standardized application interface for the card and the terminal
side.
The scope of this certification of this TOE covers all parts of the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL which are later implemented by
the user on the user card respectively token based on this TOE and the functionality of the PCD software part
which is implemented in the terminal side. The PCD software operates also on the hardware of this TOE which is
implemented in the terminal.
The CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL implements the by the OSPT alliance standardized application interface for the card and the
terminal side.
The certification comprises the entire functionality of the optional CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL implemented and operated on
the TOE hardware. On one hand the TOE can operate the PICC side software part as a token and on the other
hand, a second TOE product operates the PCD side software part if used inside a terminal or similar system.

Target of Evaluation Description


The environment on the terminal, the terminal systems, their security and their interfaces to the background
systems are not in the scope of this certification. The user operating system and further applications
implemented on the TOE are also out of scope of this certification.
To summarize, if used with the PCD software the certification view equals to the case where the TOE is running
the PICC software: The TOE operates one of the optional software parts of the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL ‚Äì regardless
whether PICC or PCD part - and is enabled to communicate via the selected interfaces. The surrounding
environment is in both cases out of scope. The CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL is delivered as object code and in this way
integrated in the user software.

The NRG software is a further order option, which implements the routines for a NRG interface. The NRG
implements an operating system handling the emulation of an NRG card together with the RF interface. One
part of the NRG software is permanently stored in the ROM and the second part consisting of patch and API is
located in the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM. The second part is only present if the NRG is a part of the delivery. If the
NRG is not part of the delivery the ROM part is present but not used. The NRG implements tearing safe
behaviour in context with the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM management and is therefore independent from the HSL.
The NRG NVM part is ‚Äì if ordered ‚Äì delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software.
The NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

Note 1:
The asymmetric cryptographic libraries regardless of the version chosen are delivery options.
Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations with the other libraries of or without these libraries. In the
case of coming without one or any combination of the asymmetric libraries the TOE does not provide the
Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or Elliptic Curve
Cryptography (EC).

The symmetric cryptographic library SCL, in two alternative versions, is a delivery option.
Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations with the other libraries of or without these libraries. In the
case of coming without the SCL the TOE does not provide the specific security functionality implemented by this
software. Even in case of a TOE coming without SCL, the symmetric cryptographic functionality is unchanged
covered by the hardware symmetric cryptographic coprocessor SCP.

The presence of the cryptographic library CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL is a delivery option.
Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations with the other libraries of or without these libraries. In the
case of coming without the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL, the TOE does not provide the specific security functionality
implemented by this software.
End of note.

2.2.5          Forms of delivery
The TOE can be delivered:
   ÔÇ∑ in form of complete modules
   ÔÇ∑ with or without inlay mounting
   ÔÇ∑ with or without inlay antenna mounting
   ÔÇ∑ in form of plain wafers
   ÔÇ∑ in any IC case (for example TSSOP28, VQFN32, VQFN40, CCS-modules, etc.)
   ÔÇ∑ in no IC case or package, simply as bare dies
   ÔÇ∑ or in whatever type of package

The form of delivery does not affect the TOE security and it can be delivered in any type, as long as the processes
applied and sites involved have been subject of the appropriate audit.
The delivery can therefore be at the end of phase 3 or at the end of phase 4 which can also include pre-
personalization steps according to PP [9]. Nevertheless in both cases the TOE is finished and the extended test
features are removed. In this document are always both cases mentioned to avoid incorrectness but from the
security policy point of view the two cases are identical.
The delivery to the software developer (phase 2 ÔÉ® phase 1) contains the development package and is delivered
in form of documentation as described above, data carriers and/or download from a secure server containing the
tools and emulators as development and debugging tool.
Part of the software delivery can also be the Flash Loader software running on the TOE and receiving the
transmitted information of the user software to be loaded into the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM. The download is only
possible after successful mutual authentication and the user software can also be downloaded in an encrypted
way. This download can also be done at a third party acting as download service provider for the user. This
organization is subject of the user.
In any case, the user is after finalization of the download and prior delivery to the field obligated to permanently
lock further use of the Flash Loader. How the user can do this is detailed in the user guidance [2].
Note that it depends on the procurement order, whether the Flash Loader program is present or not.

The belonging user guidance documents are delivered in electronic form: Either by user downloads from a secure
server or alternatively on request as encrypted email attachment.

2.2.6          Production sites
The TOE may be handled in different production sites until delivery, but the wafers of this TOE are produced in
Taiwan at two different production sites. For logistic and capacity reasons the production lines have been
doubled and thus this certification comprises the products of both production lines.
To distinguish the different production sites in the field, the two sites are coded into the Generic Chip Ident Mode
(GCIM) data. The exact coding of the generic chip identification data is described in the hardware reference
manual HRM [1].
The delivery measures are described in the ALC_DVS aspect.

The production lines are coded as follows:

‚Ä¢       Package Authentication of the Security IC, section 7.2, augmented
‚Ä¢       Package Loader, Package 1: Loader dedicated for usage in secured environment only, section 7.3.1,
conformant
This package is optional and fulfilled only by TOE products coming with Flash Loader.
‚Ä¢       Package Loader, Package 2: Loader dedicated for usage by authorized users only,
section 7.3.2, conformant
This package is optional and fulfilled only by TOE products coming with Flash Loader.
‚Ä¢       Package TDES ; section 7.4.1, augmented
The symmetric cryptographic coprocessor SCP can be blocked and the symmetric cryptographic library SCL is an
optional software. Thus this package is optional, but if one of both is available the claim is fulfilled and
augmented.
‚Ä¢       Package AES ; section 7.4.2, augmented
The symmetric cryptographic coprocessor SCP can be blocked and the symmetric cryptographic library SCL is an
optional software. Thus this package is optional, but if one of both is available the claim is fulfilled and
augmented.

                                     The assurance level of this TOE is:

Public Security Target
Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Conformance Claims (ASE_CCL)


The highest assurance component AVA_VAN.5 Vulnerability Assessment, advanced methodical vulnerability
analysis, is already standard requirement for the EAL6. Thus the augmentation is achieved by another assurance
class.

Conformance Rationale
This security target claims strict conformance only to the PP [9].
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is a typical security IC as defined in PP chapter 1.2.2 comprising:
‚Ä¢       the circuitry of the IC (hardware including the physical memories),
‚Ä¢       configuration data, initialization data related to the IC Dedicated Software and the behavior of the
security functionality
‚Ä¢       the IC Dedicated Software with the parts
‚Ä¢       the IC Dedicated Test Software,
‚Ä¢       the IC Dedicated Support Software.
The TOE is designed, produced and/or generated by the TOE Manufacturer.

Security Problem Definition
Following the PP [9], the security problem definition is enhanced by adding additional threats, organization
security policies and an augmented assumption. Including these add-ons, the security problem definition of this
security target is consistent with the statement of the security problem definition in the PP [9], as the security
target claimed strict conformance to the PP [9].

Conformance Rationale
The augmented organizational security policy P.Add-Functions, coming from the additional security
functionality of the cryptographic libraries, the augmented assumption A.Key-Function, related to the usage of
key-depending function, and the threat memory access violation T.Mem-Access, due to specific TOE memory
access control functionality, have been added. These add-ons have no impact on the conformance statements
regarding CC [10] and PP [9], with following rational:
‚Ä¢        The security target remains conformant to CC [10], claim 482 as the possibility to introduce additional
restrictions is given.
‚Ä¢        The security target fulfils the strict conformance claim of the PP [9] due to the application notes 5, 6 and
7 which apply here. By those notes the addition of further security functions and security services are covered,
even without deriving particular security functionality from a threat but from a policy.



3.1.1          Adding Objectives

    ÔÇ∑ the cryptographic libraries
            o O.Add-Functions,
    ÔÇ∑ the memory access control
            o O.Mem-Access

            o O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader and
            o O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality
additional security objectives have been introduced.
These add-ons have no impact on the conformance statements regarding CC [10] and PP [9] with following
rational:

Conformance Claims (ASE_CCL)


    ÔÇ∑   The security target remains conformant to CC [10], claim 482 as the possibility to introduce additional
        restrictions is given.
    ÔÇ∑   The security target fulfils the strict conformance of the PP [9] due to the application note 9 applying
        here. This note allows the definition of high-level security goals due to further functions or services
        provided to the Security IC Embedded Software.


3.1.2          AES and TDES

The PP [9] implements the optional policy cryptographic services P.Crypto_Service with its packages TDES and
AES. This TOE provides these optional packages requiring secure hardware based cryptographic services for the
IC Embedded Software as outlined in chapter 7.1.4.
Due to these optional additional security functionalities the security objectives O.TDES and O.AES have been
introduced. These add-ons have no impact on the conformance statements regarding CC [10] and PP [9], with
following rational:
     ÔÇ∑ The security target fulfils the strict conformance claim of the PP [9] due to the application notes applying
        here. By these notes the addition of further security functions and security services are covered, even
        without deriving particular security functionality from a threat or a policy.


3.1.3          Loader

The PP [9] implements the optional policy for applying a Loader. The Loader is used to load data into the SOLID
FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM.
The Flash Loader provides the service for authentication and implements the Package for Authentication of the
Security IC containing FIA_API.1 Authentication Proof of Identity of the TOE against a user.
This means that the user clearly can identify the TOE on his external request. This fulfils the objective
O.Authentication, authentication to external entities, and obligates an objective to the environment
OE.TOE_Auth, external entities authenticating of the TOE as outlined in the PP [9].
The Loader policy defines the Package 1 with its policy P.LIM_Block_Loader where the Loader is dedicated for
usage in secured environment only and the Package 2 with its policy P.Ctlr_Loader where the Loader is
dedicated for usage by authorized users only.
 This TOE provides a Flash Loader complying with the optional packages:
    ÔÇ∑   Package 1:
        Loader dedicated for usage in secured environment only
    ÔÇ∑   Package 2:
        Loader dedicated for usage by authorized users only as outlined in sections 7.2 and 7.3 of the PP [9]
 Due to these optional additional security functionalities the security objectives
   ÔÇ∑ O.Cap_Avail_Loader, capability and availability of the Loader,
   ÔÇ∑ O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader, access control and authenticity for the Loader and
   ÔÇ∑ OE.Loader_Usage. secure communication and usage of the Loader
   ÔÇ∑ O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality, protection of the confidentiality of the TSF
   ÔÇ∑ OE.Lim_Block_Loader, limitation of capability and blocking the Loader
have been introduced.

3.1.4         CIPURSE Cryptographic Library (CCL)

The TOE provides ‚ÄúAdditional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions)‚Äù including the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢
Cryptography. This cryptographic functionality implements additional cryptographic services by implementation
of a protocol providing a secure mutual authentication of two entities, namely the terminal (denoted as PCD =
Proximity Coupling Device (CIPURSE‚Ñ¢-compliant terminal)) and a smart card or a token in other form factors
which is called PICC. PICC stands for Proximity Integrated Circuit Card (CIPURSE‚Ñ¢-compliant card).
Beside the mutual authentication, the protocol implements measures to maintain the integrity of the transferred
data and preserves in parallel the confidentiality of the transferred data.
Due to these additional security functionalities the security objectives
    ÔÇ∑ O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL
    ÔÇ∑ O.Prot_Integrity
    ÔÇ∑ O.Prot_Confidentiality
have been introduced.

The security target fulfils the strict conformance claim of the PP [9] due to the application notes 9 applying here.
By this note the addition of further security functions and security services are covered, even without deriving
particular security functionality from a threat or a policy.
Due to the above rational, the security objectives of this security target are consistent with the statement of the
security objectives in the PP [9], as the security target claims package augmentation to the PP [9].
All security functional requirements defined in the PP [9] are included and completely defined in this ST.
A listing of all security functional requirements and where those are taken from is given in chapter 7.1.

The following security functional requirement is included and completely defined in this ST, section 6.

4              Security Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)
The content of the PP [9] applies to this chapter completely.


4.1            Threats
The threats are directed against the assets and/or the security functions of the TOE. For example, certain attacks
are only one step towards a disclosure of assets while others may directly lead to a compromise of the
application security. The more detailed description of specific attacks is given later on in the process of
evaluation and certification.
The threats to security are defined and described in PP [9] section 3.2, respectively for T.Masquerade_TOE in
chapter 7.2.1.

4.1.1          Additional Threat due to TOE specific Functionality
Threat Memory Access Violation
The additional functionality of introducing sophisticated privilege levels and access control allows the secure
separation between the operation system(s) and applications, the secure downloading of applications after
personalization and enables multitasking by separating memory areas and performing access controls between
different applications. Due to this additional functionality ‚Äúarea based memory access control‚Äù a new threat is
introduced.
The Smartcard Embedded Software is responsible for its User data of the Composite TOE according to the
assumption ‚ÄúTreatment of User data of the Composite TOE (A.Resp-Appl)‚Äù. However, the Smartcard Embedded
Software may comprise different parts, for instance an operating system and one or more applications. In this
case, such parts may accidentally or deliberately access data (including code) of other parts, which may result in
a security violation.

The TOE shall avert the threat ‚ÄúMemory Access Violation (T.Mem-Access)‚Äù as specified below:

 T.Mem-            Memory Access Violation
 Access
                   Parts of the Smartcard Embedded Software may cause security violations by accidentally or
                   deliberately accessing restricted data (which may include code) or privilege levels. Any
                   restrictions are defined by the security policy of the specific application context and must be
                   implemented by the Smartcard Embedded Software.

Threat Diffusion of Open Samples
The additional functionality of a Loader as defined in the PP [9], section 7.3 requires to address the following
threat, as defined in the document ‚ÄúPP0084: Interpretation‚Äù [9.1].
The TOE shall avert the threat ‚ÄúDiffusion of open Samples (T.Open_Samples_Diffusion)‚Äù as specified below:

 T.Open_Samples_Diffusion         Diffusion of Open Samples
                                  An attacker may get access to open samples of the TOE and use them to gain
                                  information about the TSF (loader, memory management unit, ROM code ‚Ä¶).
                                  He may also use the open samples to characterize the behavior of the IC and its
                                  security functionalities (for example: characterization of side channel profiles,
                                  perturbation cartography ‚Ä¶). The execution of a dedicated security features
                                  (for example: execution of a DES computation without countermeasures or by
                                  de-activating countermeasures) through the loading of an adequate code
                                  would allow this kind of characterization and the execution of enhanced
                                  attacks on the IC.

Note:
This threat is only relevant if the Flash Loader is still available and the attacker would in addition have the
authentication key. If both would be given, then this would enable downloading additional software.
End of note.

4.1.2          Assets regarding the Threats
The primary assets concern the User data which includes the user data of the Composite TOE as well as program
code (Security IC Embedded Software) stored and in operation and the provided security services. These assets
have to be protected while being executed and or processed and on the other hand, when the TOE is not in
operation.
This leads to four primary assets with its related security concerns:
    ÔÇ∑/ SC1 integrity of user data of the Composite TOE
    ÔÇ∑ SC2 confidentiality of user data of the Composite TOE being stored in the TOE‚Äôs protected memory
        areas
    ÔÇ∑ SC3 correct operation of the security services provided by the TOE for the Security IC Embedded
        Software
    ÔÇ∑ SC4 continuous availability of random numbers
SC4 is an additional security service provided by this TOE which is the availability of random numbers. These
random numbers are generated either by a true random number or a deterministic random number generator or
CC Document                                               44                                                        1.8

by both, when a true random number is used as seed for the deterministic random number generator. Note that
the generation of random numbers is a requirement of the PP [9].
To be able to protect the listed assets the TOE shall protect its security functionality as well. Therefore critical
information about the TOE shall be protected. Critical information includes:
     ÔÇ∑ logical design data, physical design data, IC Dedicated Software, and configuration data
     ÔÇ∑ Initialization Data and Pre-personalization Data, specific development aids, test and characterization
        related data, material for software development support, and reticles.
The information and material produced and/or processed by the TOE Manufacturer in the TOE development and
production environment (Phases 2 up to TOE Delivery) can be grouped as follows:
     ÔÇ∑ logical design data,
     ÔÇ∑ physical design data,
     ÔÇ∑ IC Dedicated Software, Security IC Embedded Software, Initialization Data and Pre-personalization
        Data,
     ÔÇ∑ specific development aids,
     ÔÇ∑ test and characterization related data,
     ÔÇ∑ material for software development support, and
     ÔÇ∑ reticles and products in any form
as long as they are generated, stored, or processed by the TOE Manufacturer.
For details see PP [9] section 3.1.


4.2            Organizational Security Policies
The TOE has to be protected during the first phases of their lifecycle (phases 2 up to TOE delivery which can be
after phase 3 or phase 4). Later on each variant of the TOE has to protect itself. The organizational security policy
according to PP [9] covers this aspect.

 P.Process-TOE              Identification during TOE Development and Production
                            An accurate identification must be established for the TOE. This requires that each
                            instantiation of the TOE carries this unique identification.

Due to the augmentations of PP [9] and the chosen packages additional policies are introduced and described in
the next chapter.

4.2.1          Augmented Organizational Security Policy
Due to the augmentations of the PP [9] and the chosen packages additional policies are introduced.
The TOE provides specific security functionality, which can be used by the Smartcard Embedded Software. In the
following specific security functionality is listed which is not derived from threats identified for the TOE‚Äôs
environment because it can only be decided in the context of the smartcard application, against which threats
the Smartcard Embedded Software will use the specific security functionality.
The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the policy ‚ÄúAdditional Specific Security Functionality
(P.Add-Functions)‚Äù as specified below.

P.Add-Functions                   Additional Specific Security Functionality
                                  The TOE shall provide the following specific security functionality to the
                                  Smartcard Embedded Software:
                                     ÔÇ∑ Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA)
                                     ÔÇ∑ Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC)
                                     ÔÇ∑ CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ Cryptographic Library (CCL)
                                     ÔÇ∑ Cipher based Message Authentication Code (CMAC by the SCL-1)

Note 2:
The cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL, and the Toolbox library as stated in chapter 1.1 are delivery
options. Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations of or even without these libraries. In the case of
coming without one or any combination of the cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL, the TOE does not
provide the Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or Elliptic
Curve Cryptography (EC) and/or CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ Cryptographic Library and/or Cipher based Message Authentication
Code (CMAC by SCL-1).
The Toolbox Library is no cryptographic library, provides no additional specific security functionality and thus the
Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
End of note.

The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the organizational security policy ‚ÄúCryptographic services of the
TOE (P.Crypto-Service)‚Äù as specified below:

 P.Crypto-Service              Cryptographic services of the TOE
                               The TOE provides secure hardware based cryptographic services for the IC
                               Embedded Software.
                                  ÔÇ∑ Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES)
                                  ÔÇ∑ Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

Note 3:
This TOE can come with both cryptographic coprocessors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked
Crypto2304T, or with both crypto co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior
to the production of the hardware. In case the SCP is blocked, no AES and DES respectively CMAC computation
supported by hardware or SCL is possible. In case the Crypto2304T is blocked, no RSA and EC computation ‚Äì of
any version as stated in chapter 1.1 - supported by hardware is possible. No accessibility of the deselected
cryptographic co-processors is without impact on any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to
the situation where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic co-processors.
End of note.

The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the organizational security policy ‚ÄúLimiting and Blocking the Loader
Functionality (P.Lim_Block_Loader)‚Äù as specified below:

 P.Lim_Block_Loader             Limiting and Blocking the Loader Functionality
                                The composite manufacturer uses the Loader for loading of Security IC
                                Embedded Software, user data of the Composite Product or IC Dedicated
                                Support Software in charge of the IC Manufacturer. He limits the capability
                                and blocks the availability of the Loader in order to protect stored data from
                                disclosure and manipulation.
 P.Ctrl_Loader                  Controlled usage to Loader Functionality
                                Authorized user controls the usage of the Loader functionality in order to
                                protect stored and loaded user data from disclosure and manipulation.



4.3           Assumptions
The TOE assumptions on the operational environment are defined and described in PP [9] section 3.4.
The assumptions concern the phases where the TOE has left the chip manufacturer.
The support of cipher schemas requires an additional assumption.

 A.Process-Sec-IC                Protection during Packaging, Finishing and Personalization
                                 It is assumed that security procedures are used after delivery of the TOE by
                                 the TOE Manufacturer up to delivery to the end-consumer to maintain
                                 confidentiality and integrity of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test
                                 data (to prevent any possible copy, modification, retention, theft or
                                 unauthorized use).
 A.Resp-Appl                     Treatment of User data of the Composite TOE
                                 All User data of the Composite TOE are owned by Security IC Embedded
                                 Software. Therefore, it must be assumed that security relevant User data of
                                 the Composite TOE (especially cryptographic keys) are treated by the
                                 Security IC Embedded Software as defined for its specific application context.


4.3.1         Augmented Assumptions
The developer of the Smartcard Embedded Software must ensure the appropriate ‚ÄúUsage of Key-dependent
Functions (A.Key-Function)‚Äù while developing this software in Phase 1 as specified below.

 A.Key-Function               Usage of Key-dependent Functions
                              Key-dependent functions (if any) shall be implemented in the Smartcard
                              Embedded Software in a way that they are not susceptible to leakage attacks
                              (as described under T.Leak-Inherent and T.Leak-Forced).

Note that here the routines which may compromise keys when being executed are part of the Smartcard
Embedded Software. In contrast to this the threats T.Leak-Inherent and T.Leak-Forced address (i) the
cryptographic routines which are part of the TOE. For details please refer to PP [9] section 3.4.

4.3.2          Note regarding CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL
The CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL as cryptographic functionality establishes a cryptographic secured communication channel
between two identified entities. Depending on the implementation and usage, the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL can act either
in the PICC or in the PCD role. In any case the secrets applied for establishing and usage of the secured channel
must be treated in an appropriate way by both entities PICC and PCD.
This means that it is essential on user side that the critical data for establishing this cryptographic secured
communication channel is generated and stored in an appropriate way and that integrity and confidentiality is
maintained.
These preconditions are treated in the PP [9] section 3.1 claims 67 and 68, and are the reason for not placing an
assumption here.

Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


Note 4:
The objectives O.Cap_Avail_Loader, O. Authentication, O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader and O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality
apply only at TOE products coming with activated Flash Loader enabled for software or data download by the
user. In other cases the Flash Loader is not available anymore and the user software or data download is
completed. Depending on the capabilities of the user software these objectives may then reoccur as subject of
the composite TOE.
End of note.

The TOE provides ‚ÄúAdditional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions)‚Äù as specified below.

 O.Add-Functions              Additional Specific Security Functionality
                              The TOE must provide the following specific security functionality to the
                              Smartcard Embedded Software:
                                 ÔÇ∑ Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA)
                                 ÔÇ∑ Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC)
                                 ÔÇ∑ CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ Cryptography
                                 ÔÇ∑ Cipher base Message authentication code (CMAC)

Note 5:
The cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL and the Toolbox library are delivery options, regardless of the
version chosen. Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations of or even without these libraries. In the
case of coming without one or any combination of the cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL the TOE does
not provide the Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC) and/or CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ Cryptographic Library and/or Cipher based Message
Authentication Code (CMAC by the SCL-1).
The Toolbox Library is no cryptographic library, provides no additional specific security functionality and thus the
Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
End of note.

Note 6:
This TOE can come with both crypto co-processors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked
Crypto2304T, or with both crypto co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior
to the production of the hardware. In case the SCP is blocked, no AES and DES computation supported by
hardware is possible. In case the Crypto2304T is blocked, no RSA and EC computation ‚Äì in any of the version
stated in chapter 1.1 ‚Äì supported by hardware is possible. No accessibility of the deselected cryptographic co-
processors is without impact on any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the situation
where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic co-processors.
End of note.

Note 7:
In case the SCP is blocked, no AES, no DES and no Cipher based Message Authentication Code (CMAC by SCL)
computation supported by hardware is possible and thus the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL and SCL usage is not possible. This is
regardless of the library version chosen.
End of note.

The TOE shall provide ‚ÄúArea based Memory Access Control (O.Mem-Access)‚Äù as specified below.

 O.Mem Access                Area based Memory Access Control
                             The TOE must provide the Smartcard Embedded Software with the capability to
                             define restricted access memory areas. The TOE must then enforce the

                             privilege levels is controlled as required, for example, in a multi-application
                             environment.

The additional functionality of a Loader as defined in the PP [9], section 7.3 requires to address the following
objective, as defined in the document ‚ÄúPP0084: Interpretation‚Äù [9.1].

                              any other communication between the two entities is applied.

 O.Prot_Integrity             Integrity protection
                              The CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL must implement integrity protection functionality for the user

 O.Prot_Confidentiality Confidentiality protection
                        The CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL must protect the confidentiality of the user data to be

5.2            Security Objectives from PP for development and environment
The security objectives for the security IC embedded software development environment and the operational
environment are defined in PP [9] section 4.2, 4.3, 7.2.1and 7.3.

For secure use of the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL it is essential that on user side the common secret is generated and stored in
an appropriate way and that integrity and confidentiality of this user secret is maintained. These preconditions
are treated in the PP [9] section 3.1 claims 67 and 68.

The operational environment of the TOE shall provide ‚ÄúLimitation of capability and blocking the Loader
‚ÄúOE.Lim_Block_Loader‚Äù, ‚ÄúExternal entities authentication of the TOE ‚ÄúOE.TOE_Auth" and ‚ÄúSecure
communication and usage of the Loader ‚ÄúOE.Loader¬¨Usage‚Äù as specified below:

 OE.Lim_Block_Loader            Limitation of capability and blocking the Loader
                                The Composite Product Manufacturer will protect the Loader functionality
                                against misuse, limit the capability of the Loader and terminate irreversibly
                                the Loader after intended usage of the Loader.
 OE.TOE_Auth                    Authentication to external entities
                                The operational environment shall support the authentication verification
                                mechanism and know authentication reference data of the TOE.
 OE.Loader_Usage                Secure communication and usage of the Loader
                                The authorized user must support the trusted communication with the TOE by
                                confidentiality protection and authenticity proof of the data to be loaded and
                                fulfilling the access conditions required by the Loader.
 OE.Process-Sec-IC              Protection during composite product manufacturing
                                The protection during packaging, finishing and personalization includes also
                                the personalization process (Flash Loader) and the personalization data (TOE
                                software components) during Phase 4, Phase 5 and Phase 6.

Note 8:
The objectives OE.Lim_Block_Loader, OE.TOE_Auth, OE.Loader_Usage and OE.Process-Sec-IC for the
development and operation environment apply only at TOE products coming with activated Flash Loader
enabled for user data download. In other cases the Flash Loader is not available anymore and the user data
download is completed. Depending on the capabilities of the user software this objective may then reoccur as
subject of the composite TOE.
End of note.


5.3            Security Objectives for the Environment
Since the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL requires the presence of a common secret on both communication entities an additional
objective for the environment is generated:
Following objectives are defined here.

 OE.Resp-Appl                  Treatment of User data of the Composite TOE
                               Please refer to chapter 5.3.1 for clarification

Note 9:
The CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL is a delivery option. In case the user has ordered the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL, the user is responsible to
implement the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL into his user software. In addition, the user has to generate and treat the common
secret in an appropriate way. The objective common secret is therefore similar to the OE.Resp-Appl. Anyhow,
processes and treatment is exclusively subject of the user and his logistic processes.
End of note.

Note 10:
If the user decides to use the integrity protection mode of the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL then the confidentiality of the user
data to be transferred is solely subject of the user.
End of note.

Note 11:
The CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL as cryptographic functionality establishes a cryptographic secured communication channel
between two identified entities. Depending on the implementation and usage, the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL can act either
in the PICC or in the PCD role. In any case the secrets applied for establishing and usage of the secured channel
must be treated in an appropriate way by both entities PICC and PCD.
This means that it is essential on user side that the critical data for establishing this cryptographic secured
communication channel is generated and stored in an appropriate way and that integrity and confidentiality is
maintained.
These preconditions are treated in the PP [9] section 3.1 claims 67 and 68, and are the reason for not placing an
objective for the environment here.
End of note.

(1) These objectives are only valid if the TOE is delivered with active Flash Loader.


5.3.1          Clarification of ‚ÄúTreatment of User Data (OE.Resp-Appl)‚Äù
Regarding the cryptographic services this objective of the environment has to be clarified.
By definition cipher or plain text data and cryptographic keys are user data of the Composite TOE. The
Smartcard Embedded Software shall treat these data appropriately, use only proper secret keys (chosen from a
large key space) as input for the cryptographic function of the TOE and use keys and functions appropriately in
order to ensure the strength of cryptographic operation.
This means that keys are treated as confidential as soon as they are generated. The keys must be unique with a
very high probability, as well as cryptographically strong. For example, it must be ensured that it is beyond
practicality to derive the private key from a public key if asymmetric algorithms are used. If keys are imported
into the TOE and/or derived from other keys, quality and confidentiality must be maintained. This implies that
appropriate key management has to be realized in the environment.
Regarding the memory, software and firmware protection and the SFR and peripheral access rights handling
these objectives of the environment has to be clarified. The treatment of user data of the Composite TOE is also
required when a multi-application operating system is implemented as part of the Smartcard Embedded
Software on the TOE. In this case the multi-application operating system should not disclose security relevant
user data of one application to another application when it is processed or stored on the TOE.


5.3.2     Clarification of ‚ÄúProtection during Composite product Manufacturing
(OE.Process-Sec-IC)‚Äù
The protection during packaging, finishing and personalization includes also the personalization process (Flash
Loader) and the personalization data (TOE software components) during Phase 4, Phase 5 and Phase 6.

Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


 5.5           P.Add-Functions
The justification related to the security objective ‚ÄúAdditional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions)‚Äù
is as follows: Since O.Add-Functions requires the TOE to implement exactly the same specific security
functionality as required by P.Add-Functions; the organizational security policy is covered by the objective.

Nevertheless the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing, O.Malfunction, O.Phys-Manipulation and
O.Leak-Forced define how to implement the specific security functionality required by P.Add-Functions. (Note
that these objectives support that the specific security functionality is provided in a secure way as expected from
P.Add-Functions.) Especially O.Leak-Inherent and O.Leak-Forced refer to the protection of confidential data
(User data of the Composite TOE or TSF data) in general. User data of the Composite TOE are also processed by
the specific security functionality required by P.Add-Functions.

The policy P.Add functions includes the function CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ Cryptographic Library (CCL). This functionality
implements the objectives O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL, O.Prot_Integrity and O.Prot_Confidentiality. The CIPURSE‚Ñ¢
Cryptographic Library (CCL) first prepares and establishes a secure communication channel between two
authenticated entities. The mutual authentication means covers the objective O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL. The
implemented means of session key generation and integrity protection prepares for the confidential and
integrity protected exchange of user data between the two authenti        Assets regarding the Threats
The primary assets concern the User data which includes the user data of the Composite TOE as well as program
code (Security IC Embedded Software) stored and in operation and the provided security services. These assets
have to be protected while being executed and or processed and on the other hand, when the TOE is not in
operation.
This leads to four primary assets with its related security concerns:
    ÔÇ∑/ SC1 integrity of user data of the Composite TOE
    ÔÇ∑ SC2 confidentiality of user data of the Composite TOE being stored in the TOE‚Äôs protected memory
        areas
    ÔÇ∑ SC3 correct operation of the security services provided by the TOE for the Security IC Embedded
        Software
    ÔÇ∑ SC4 continuous availability of random numbers
SC4 is an additional security service provided by this TOE which is the availability of random numbers. These
random numbers are generated either by a true random number or a deterministic random number generator or
CC Document                                               44                                                        1.8

by both, when a true random number is used as seed for the deterministic random number generator. Note that
the generation of random numbers is a requirement of the PP [9].
To be able to protect the listed assets the TOE shall protect its security functionality as well. Therefore critical
information about the TOE shall be protected. Critical information includes:
     ÔÇ∑ logical design data, physical design data, IC Dedicated Software, and configuration data
     ÔÇ∑ Initialization Data and Pre-personalization Data, specific development aids, test and characterization
        related data, material for software development support, and reticles.
The information and material produced and/or processed by the TOE Manufacturer in the TOE development and
production environment (Phases 2 up to TOE Delivery) can be grouped as follows:
     ÔÇ∑ logical design data,
     ÔÇ∑ physical design data,
     ÔÇ∑ IC Dedicated Software, Security IC Embedded Software, Initialization Data and Pre-personalization
        Data,
     ÔÇ∑ specific development aids,
     ÔÇ∑ test and characterization related data,
     ÔÇ∑ material for software development support, and
     ÔÇ∑ reticles and products in any form
as long as they are generated, stored, or processed by the TOE Manufacturer.
For details see PP [9] section 3.1.


4.2            Organizational Security Policies
The TOE has to be protected during the first phases of their lifecycle (phases 2 up to TOE delivery which can be
after phase 3 or phase 4). Later on each variant of the TOE has to protect itself. The organizational security policy
according to PP [9] covers this aspect.

 P.Process-TOE              Identification during TOE Development and Production
                            An accurate identification must be established for the TOE. This requires that each
                            instantiation of the TOE carries this unique identification.

Due to the augmentations of PP [9] and the chosen packages additional policies are introduced and described in
the next chapter.

4.2.1          Augmented Organizational Security Policy
Due to the augmentations of the PP [9] and the chosen packages additional policies are introduced.
The TOE provides specific security functionality, which can be used by the Smartcard Embedded Software. In the
following specific security functionality is listed which is not derived from threats identified for the TOE‚Äôs
environment because it can only be decided in the context of the smartcard application, against which threats
the Smartcard Embedded Software will use the specific security functionality.
The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the policy ‚ÄúAdditional Specific Security Functionality
(P.Add-Functions)‚Äù as specified below.

P.Add-Functions                   Additional Specific Security Functionality
                                  The TOE shall provide the following specific security functionality to the
                                  Smartcard Embedded Software:
                                     ÔÇ∑ Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA)
                                     ÔÇ∑ Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC)
                                     ÔÇ∑ CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ Cryptographic Library (CCL)
                                     ÔÇ∑ Cipher based Message Authentication Code (CMAC by the SCL-1)

Note 2:
The cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL, and the Toolbox library as stated in chapter 1.1 are delivery
options. Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations of or even without these libraries. In the case of
coming without one or any combination of the cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL, the TOE does not
provide the Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or Elliptic
Curve Cryptography (EC) and/or CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ Cryptographic Library and/or Cipher based Message Authentication
Code (CMAC by SCL-1).
The Toolbox Library is no cryptographic library, provides no additional specific security functionality and thus the
Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
End of note.

The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the organizational security policy ‚ÄúCryptographic services of the
TOE (P.Crypto-Service)‚Äù as specified below:

 P.Crypto-Service              Cryptographic services of the TOE
                               The TOE provides secure hardware based cryptographic services for the IC
                               Embedded Software.
                                  ÔÇ∑ Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES)
                                  ÔÇ∑ Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

Note 3:
This TOE can come with both cryptographic coprocessors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked
Crypto2304T, or with both crypto co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior
to the production of the hardware. In case the SCP is blocked, no AES and DES respectively CMAC computation
supported by hardware or SCL is possible. In case the Crypto2304T is blocked, no RSA and EC computation ‚Äì of
any version as stated in chapter 1.1 - supported by hardware is possible. No accessibility of the deselected
cryptographic co-processors is without impact on any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to
the situation where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic co-processors.

The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the organizational security policy ‚ÄúLimiting and Blocking the Loader
Functionality (P.Lim_Block_Loader)‚Äù as specified below:

 P.Lim_Block_Loader             Limiting and Blocking the Loader Functionality
                                The composite manufacturer uses the Loader for loading of Security IC
                                Embedded Software, user data of the Composite Product or IC Dedicated
                                Support Software in charge of the IC Manufacturer. He limits the capability
                                and blocks the availability of the Loader in order to protect stored data from
                                disclosure and manipulation.
 P.Ctrl_Loader                  Controlled usage to Loader Functionality
                                Authorized user controls the usage of the Loader functionality in order to
                                protect stored and loaded user data from disclosure and manipulation.



4.3           Assumptions
The TOE assumptions on the operational environment are defined and described in PP [9] section 3.4.
The assumptions concern the phases where the TOE has left the chip manufacturer.
The support of cipher schemas requires an additional assumption.

 A.Process-Sec-IC                Protection during Packaging, Finishing and Personalization
                                 It is assumed that security procedures are used after delivery of the TOE by
                                 the TOE Manufacturer up to delivery to the end-consumer to maintain
                                 confidentiality and integrity of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test
                                 data (to prevent any possible copy, modification, retention, theft or
                                 unauthorized use).
 A.Resp-Appl                     Treatment of User data of the Composite TOE
                                 All User data of the Composite TOE are owned by Security IC Embedded
                                 Software. Therefore, it must be assumed that security relevant User data of
                                 the Composite TOE (especially cryptographic keys) are treated by the
                                 Security IC Embedded Software as defined for its specific application context.


4.3.1         Augmented Assumptions
The developer of the Smartcard Embedded Software must ensure the appropriate ‚ÄúUsage of Key-dependent
Functions (A.Key-Function)‚Äù while developing this software in Phase 1 as specified below.

 A.Key-Function               Usage of Key-dependent Functions
                              Key-dependent functions (if any) shall be implemented in the Smartcard
                              Embedded Software in a way that they are not susceptible to leakage attacks
                              (as described under T.Leak-Inherent and T.Leak-Forced).

Note that here the routines which may compromise keys when being executed are part of the Smartcard
Embedded Software. In contrast to this the threats T.Leak-Inherent and T.Leak-Forced address (i) the
cryptographic routines which are part of the TOE. For details please refer to PP [9] section 3.4.

4.3.2          Note regarding CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL
The CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL as cryptographic functionality establishes a cryptographic secured communication channel
between two identified entities. Depending on the implementation and usage, the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL can act either
in the PICC or in the PCD role. In any case the secrets applied for establishing and usage of the secured channel
must be treated in an appropriate way by both entities PICC and PCD.
This means that it is essential on user side that the critical data for establishing this cryptographic secured
communication channel is generated and stored in an appropriate way and that integrity and confidentiality is
maintained.
These preconditions are treated in the PP [9] section 3.1 claims 67 and 68, and are the reason for not placing an
assumption here.

Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


The TOE shall provide ‚ÄúArea based Memory Access Control (O.Mem-Access)‚Äù as specified below.

 O.Mem Access                Area based Memory Access Control
                             The TOE must provide the Smartcard Embedded Software with the capability to
                             define restricted access memory areas. The TOE must then enforce the
                             partitioning of such memory areas so that access of software to memory areas and
                             privilege levels is controlled as required, for example, in a multi-application
                             environment.

of the version in use -, downloading and/or running the operating
system and to establish a clear separation between different applications. Nevertheless, it is also possible to
define a shared memory section where separated applications may exchange defined data. The privilege levels
clearly define by using a hierarchical model the access right from one level to the other. These measures ensure
that the threat T.Mem-Access is clearly covered by the security objective O.Mem-Access.


 5.8           P.Ctrl_Loader, P.Lim_Block_Loader, T.Masquerade_TOE and
               T.Open_Samples_Diffusion
The PP [9] section 7.3 considers the life cycle phases of the TOE also with the organizational policy
P.Lim_Block_Loader and P.Ctlr_Loader as the TOE must be protected against unauthorized usage and control
and against download of malicious software before, during and after the user downloads his software. This is
formalized with the objectives O.Cap_Avail_Loader, O.Authentication and O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader requiring
authentication of the TOE to external entities and a trusted communication channel. The O.Authentication
implements a mutual authentication and involves the environment therefore.
And the policies cover also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must be
regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.
The implemented mutual authentication requires first to authenticate the TOE to the external user. This requires
also knowledge by the user about the sequence of the protocol, interpretation of the transferred data and how to
start the authentication of the TOE. This authentication mean counters the threat T.Masquerade_TOE as only
the genuine TOE is able to identify itself correctly to the enabled user, which covers O.Authentication.
The second step of the mutual authentications mean implements the authentication of the user to the TOE. Only
the user enabled to present the correct authentication data and knowing about the sequence, data
interpretation and signaling of the authentication to the TOE is able to proceed further on.
This enforces OE.TOE_Auth, requiring the support of the verification mechanism and known authentication
reference data by the operational environment.

It is normal business that products enabled for software download by the user are either on their way to the user
or are already stored at user premises. At both situations it cannot be excluded that an attacker could manage to
steal such products enabled for software downloads. The ability to download software on a chip without
operating system and/or application is defined as open sample.
This situation generates the threat T.Open_Samples_Diffusion which is defined as follows:
The download of analysis software could enable an attacker to characterize the product and to construct an
attack path out of the gained information.
This threat is countered by the Flash Loader by following rational:
As long as the Flash Loader is active, controlled usage to the Flash Loader functionality (P.Ctrl_Loader) is
enforced which protects the TOE from achieving the status of being an open sample. And more, even the
attacker could observe, meaning in the sense of measurements during, or induce faults during an authorized
download, the Flash Loader protects the user data of the download by confidentiality and integrity protection
means. The Flash Loader functionalities of mutual authentication, establishing a dedicated trusted
communication channel, the encryption and integrity protection means cover the objectives
O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality, O.Leak-Inherent and O.Leak-Forced.
The policy P.Ctrl_Loader covers also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must
be regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.

Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


The algorithm strength of the Flash Loader has not been cryptographic-analytically evaluated by the BSI, as
Infineon has implemented a proprietary extension.
End of note.

The objective O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader Access control and authenticity for the Loader is covered by following
rational:
The identification of the communication entities of the Flash Loader requires the presence of dedicated
identification data for passing successfully the mutual authentication. This enforces the policy P.Ctrl_Loader
comprising the aspect of the mutual authentication. After successful authentication the user is enabled to
change the keys used for authentication and downloading the user data. This first user is defined as the
administrator. The TOE can then further be operated for example by a service partner who is defined as being
the Download Operator. The equal protecting means as for the Administrator apply here again but due to the
key change different roles are established. The Download Operator downloads then the encrypted user data
with the Flash Loader into the defined and accessible SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM area. This area is access protected by
the MMU.

OE.Travel_Document_Holder
  Travel document holder Obligations
  The travel document holder may reveal, if necessary, his or her verification
  values of the PACE password to an authorized person or device who definitely
  act according to respective regulations and are trustworthy.

4.2.5 Receiving State or Organisation

OE.Exam_Travel_Document
  Examination of the physical part of the travel document
  The inspection system of the receiving State or Organisation must examine
  the travel document presented by the traveler to verify its authenticity by
  means of the physical security measures and to detect any manipulation of the
  physical part of the travel document. The Basic Inspection System for global
  interoperability (i) includes the Country Signing CA Public Key and the
  Document Signer Public Key of each issuing State or Organisation, and (ii)
  implements the terminal part of PACE [ICAO-9303] part 11 and/or the Basic
  Access Control [ICAO-9303]. Extended Inspection Systems perform
  additionally to these points the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1 to verify
  the Authenticity of the presented travel document‚Äôs chip.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Counterfeit and the Assumption A.Insp_Sys by demanding the Inspection
  System       to     perform     the     Chip     Authentication     protocolv.1.
  OE.Exam_Travel_Document also repeats partly the requirements from
  OE.Terminal in [PACE-PP] and therefore also counters T.Forgery and A.
  Passive_Auth from [PACE-PP]. This is done because a new type of Inspection
  System is introduced in this PP as the Extended Inspection System is needed

OE.AA_MRTD
      Active Authentication - Inspection Systems5
      An Active Authentication (Basic, General or Extended) Inspection system
      performs all the functions of the Basic, General and Extended Inspection
      System, and verifies the IC authenticity with an RSA or ECDSA signature
      generated by the MRTD (if available).



OE.Prot_Logical_Travel_Document
  Protection of data from the logical travel document
  The inspection system of the receiving State or Organisation ensures the
  confidentiality and integrity of the data read from the logical travel document.
  The inspection system will prevent eavesdropping to their communication with
  the TOE before secure messaging is successfully established based on the Chip
  Authentication Protocol Version 1.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP]in order to handle the Assumption
  A.Insp_Sys by requiring the Inspection System to perform secure messaging
  based on the Chip Authentication Protocol v.1.

OE.Ext_Insp_Systems
  Authorization of Extended Inspection Systems
  The Document Verifier of receiving States or Organisations authorizes
  Extended Inspection Systems by creation of Inspection System Certificates for
  access to sensitive biometric reference data of the logical travel document.
  The Extended Inspection System authenticates themselves to the travel
  document‚Äôs chip for access to the sensitive biometric reference data with its
  private Terminal Authentication Key and its Inspection System Certificate.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Read_Sensitive_Data, the Organisational Security Policy P.Sensitive_Data
  and the Assumption A. Auth_PKI as it specifies the pre-requisite for the
  Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 as it concerns the responsibilities of the
  Document Verifier and the Inspection Systems.

4.3 Security Objectives Rationale

4.3.1 Threats

4.3.1.1 Threats listed in PP PACE

T.Skimming addresses accessing the User Data (stored on the TOE or
  transferred between the TOE and the terminal) using the TOE's
  contactless/contact interface. This threat is countered by the security
  objectives        OT.Data_Integrity,        OT.Data_Authenticity        and
  OT.Data_Confidentiality through the PACE authentication. The objective
  OE.Travel_Document_Holder ensures that a PACE session can only be
  established either by the travel document holder itself or by an authorised
  person or device, and, hence, cannot be captured by an attacker.

T.Eavesdropping addresses listening to the communication between the TOE
  and a rightful terminal in order to gain the User Data transferred there. This
  threat is countered by the security objective OT.Data_Confidentiality through a
  trusted channel based on the PACE authentication.

T.Tracing addresses gathering TOE tracing data identifying it remotely by
  establishing or listening to a communication via the contactless/contact
  interface of the TOE, whereby the attacker does not a priori know the correct
  values of the PACE password. This threat is directly countered by security
  objectives    OT.Tracing   (no    gathering   TOE     tracing    data)   and
  OE.Travel_Document_Holder (the attacker does not a priori know the correct
  values of the shared passwords).

T.Forgery 'Forgery of data' addresses the fraudulent, complete or partial
  alteration of the User Data or/and TSF-data stored on the TOE or/and
  exchanged between the TOE and the terminal. Additionally to the security
  objectives from PACE PP [PACE-PP] which counter this threat, the examination
  of     the     presented   MRTD       passport    book       according    to
  OE.Exam_Travel_Document 'Examination of the physical part of the travel
  document' shall ensure its authenticity by means of the physical security
  measures and detect any manipulation of the physical part of the travel
  document.
  The threat T.Forgery also addresses the fraudulent, complete or partial
  alteration of the User Data or/and TSF-data stored on the TOE or/and

A.      Certification

1.      Preliminary Remarks
Under the BSIG1 Act, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) has the task of
issuing certificates for information technology products.
Certification of a product is carried out on the instigation of the vendor or a distributor,
hereinafter called the sponsor.
A part of the procedure is the technical examination (evaluation) of the product according
to the security criteria published by the BSI or generally recognised security criteria.
The evaluation is normally carried out by an evaluation facility recognised by the BSI or by
BSI itself.
The result of the certification procedure is the present Certification Report. This report
contains among others the certificate (summarised assessment) and the detailed
Certification Results.
The Certification Results contain the technical description of the security functionality of
the certified product, the details of the evaluation (strength and weaknesses) and
instructions for the user.

2.      Specifications of the Certification Procedure
The certification body conducts the procedure according to the criteria laid down in the
following:
‚óè   Act on the Federal Office for Information Security 1
‚óè   BSI Certification and Approval Ordinance2
‚óè   BSI Schedule of Costs3
‚óè   Special decrees issued by the Bundesministerium des Innern (Federal Ministry of the
    Interior)

3.      Recognition Agreements
In order to avoid multiple certification of the same product in different countries a mutual
recognition of IT security certificates - as far as such certificates are based on ITSEC or
CC - under certain conditions was agreed.

3.1.    European Recognition of CC ‚Äì Certificates (SOGIS-MRA)
The SOGIS-Mutual Recognition Agreement (SOGIS-MRA) Version 3 became effective in
April 2010. It defines the recognition of certificates for IT-Products at a basic recognition
level and, in addition, at higher recognition levels for IT-Products related to certain SOGIS
Technical Domains only.
The basic recognition level includes Common Criteria (CC) Evaluation Assurance Levels
EAL 1 to EAL 4. For "Smartcards and similar devices" a SOGIS Technical Domain is in
place. For "HW Devices with Security Boxes" a SOGIS Technical Domains is in place, too.
In addition, certificates issued for Protection Profiles based on Common Criteria are part of
the recognition agreement.
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes, details on
recognition, and the history of the agreement can be seen on the website at
https://www.sogisportal.eu.
The SOGIS-MRA logo printed on the certificate indicates that it is recognised under the
terms of this agreement by the related bodies of the signatory nations. A disclaimer
beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of recognition.
This certificate is recognized under SOGIS-MRA for all assurance components selected.

3.2.    International Recognition of CC ‚Äì Certificates (CCRA)
The international arrangement on the mutual recognition of certificates based on the CC
(Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement, CCRA-2014) has been ratified on 08
September 2014. It covers CC certificates based on collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP)
(exact use), CC certificates based on assurance components up to and including EAL 2 or
the assurance family Flaw Remediation (ALC_FLR) and CC certificates for Protection
Profiles and for collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP).
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes can be seen on
the website: https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org.
The Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement logo printed on the certificate indicates
that this certification is recognised under the terms of this agreement by the related bodies
of the signatory nations. A disclaimer beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of
recognition.

4.      Performance of Evaluation and Certification
The certification body monitors each individual evaluation to ensure a uniform procedure, a
uniform interpretation of the criteria and uniform ratings.
The product IFX_CCI_000Dh, IFX_CCI_0020h, IFX_CCI_0031h, IFX_CCI_0032h,
IFX_CCI_0034h, IFX_CCI_0037h design step T31 and M31 with optional HSL v2.62.7626,
optional SCL version v2.04.003, UMSLC lib v01.00.0234 with specific IC-dedicated
firmware identifier 80.301.05.1 and user guidance has undergone the certification
procedure at BSI.
The evaluation of the product IFX_CCI_000Dh, IFX_CCI_0020h, IFX_CCI_0031h,
IFX_CCI_0032h, IFX_CCI_0034h, IFX_CCI_0037h design step T31 and M31 with optional
HSL v2.62.7626, optional SCL version v2.04.003, UMSLC lib v01.00.0234 with specific IC-
dedicated firmware identifier 80.301.05.1 and user guidance was conducted by T√úV
Informationstechnik GmbH. The evaluation was completed on 9 October 2019. T√úV
Informationstechnik GmbH is an evaluation facility (ITSEF) 5 recognised by the certification
body of BSI.
For this certification procedure the sponsor and applicant is: Infineon Technologies AG.
The product was developed by: Infineon Technologies AG.
The certification is concluded with the comparability check and the production of this
Certification Report. This work was completed by the BSI.

5.      Validity of the Certification Result
This Certification Report applies only to the version of the product as indicated. The
confirmed assurance package is valid on the condition that
‚óè   all stipulations regarding generation, configuration and operation, as given in the
    following report, are observed,
‚óè   the product is operated in the environment described, as specified in the following report
    and in the Security Target.
For the meaning of the assurance components and assurance levels please refer to CC
itself. Detailed references are listed in part C of this report.
The Certificate issued confirms the assurance of the product claimed in the Security Target
at the date of certification. As attack methods evolve over time, the resistance of the
certified version of the product against new attack methods needs to be re-assessed.
Therefore, the sponsor should apply for the certified product being monitored within the
assurance continuity program of the BSI Certification Scheme (e.g. by a re-assessment or
re-certification). Specifically, if results of the certification are used in subsequent evaluation
and certification procedures, in a system integration process or if a user's risk
management needs regularly updated results, it is recommended to perform a re-
assessment on a regular e.g. annual basis.

In order to avoid an indefinite usage of the certificate when evolved attack methods would
require a re-assessment of the products resistance to state of the art attack methods, the
maximum validity of the certificate has been limited. The certificate issued on 15 October
2019 is valid until 14 October 2024. Validity can be re-newed by re-certification.
The owner of the certificate is obliged:
     1. when advertising the certificate or the fact of the product's certification, to refer to
        the Certification Report as well as to provide the Certification Report, the Security
        Target and user guidance documentation mentioned herein to any customer of the
        product for the application and usage of the certified product,
     2. to inform the Certification Body at BSI immediately about vulnerabilities of the
        product that have been identified by the developer or any third party after issuance
        of the certificate,
     3. to inform the Certification Body at BSI immediately in the case that security relevant
        changes in the evaluated life cycle, e.g. related to development and production sites
        or processes, occur, or the confidentiality of documentation and information related
        to the Target of Evaluation (TOE) or resulting from the evaluation and certification
        procedure where the certification of the product has assumed this confidentiality
        being maintained, is not given any longer. In particular, prior to the dissemination of
        confidential documentation and information related to the TOE or resulting from the
        evaluation and certification procedure that do not belong to the deliverables
        according to the Certification Report part B, or for those where no dissemination
        rules have been agreed on, to third parties, the Certification Body at BSI has to be
        informed.
In case of changes to the certified version of the product, the validity can be extended to
the new versions and releases, provided the sponsor applies for assurance continuity (i.e.
re-certification or maintenance) of the modified product, in accordance with the procedural
requirements, and the evaluation does not reveal any security deficiencies.

1.     Executive Summary
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is the IFX_CCI_000Dh, IFX_CCI_0020h, IFX_CCI_0031h,
IFX_CCI_0032h, IFX_CCI_0034h, IFX_CCI_0037h design step T31 and M31 with optional
HSL v2.62.7626, optional SCL version v2.04.003, UMSLC lib v01.00.0234 with specific IC-
dedicated firmware identifier 80.301.05.1 and user guidance.
The Security Target [6] is the basis for this certification. It is based on the certified
Protection Profile Security IC Platform Protection Profile with Augmentation Packages
Version 1.0, 13 January 2014, BSI-CC-PP-0084-2014 [8].
The TOE Security Assurance Requirements (SAR) are based entirely on the assurance
components defined in Part 3 of the Common Criteria (see part C or [1], Part 3 for details).
The TOE meets the assurance requirements of the Evaluation Assurance Level EAL 5
augmented by ALC_DVS.2 and AVA_VAN.5.
The TOE Security Functional Requirements (SFR) relevant for the TOE are outlined in the
Security Target [6] and [9], chapter 6. They are selected from Common Criteria Part 2 and
some of them are newly defined. Thus the TOE is CC Part 2 extended.
The TOE Security Functional Requirements are implemented by the following TOE
Security Functionality:
       TOE Security Functionality            Addressed issue
       SF_DPM                                Device Phase Management:
                                             The life cycle of the TOE is split up into several
                                             phases. Different operation modes help to protect
                                             the TOE during each phase of its lifecycle.
       SF_PS                                 Protection against Snooping:
                                             The TOE uses various means to protect from
                                             snooping.
       SF_PMA                                Protection against Modifying Attacks:
                                             This TOE implements protection            against
                                             modifying attacks of various TOE parts.
       SF_PLA                                Protection against Logical Attacks
       SF_CS                                 Cryptographic Support:
                                             The TOE is equipped with a hardware accelerator
                                             and an optional symmetric cryptographic library
                                             (SCL) to support the standard symmetric
                                             cryptographic operations TDES and AES.
                                             Additionally, the TOE is equipped with a True
                                             Random Number Generator for the generation of
                                             random numbers

                                     Table 2: Deliverables of the TOE
The hardware part of the TOE is identified by its Common Criteria Identifiers (CCI)
IFX_CCI_000Dh, IFX_CCI_0020h, IFX_CCI_0031h, IFX_CCI_0032h, IFX_CCI_0034h
and IFX_CCI_0034h in conjunction with the design steps T31 or M31. The complete chip
identification data is accessible via the Generic Chip Identification Mode (GCIM).
In dependence of the chosen delivery procedure (flashed at developer site or not), the
following remark needs to be taken into account:
As the TOE is under control of the user software, the TOE Manufacturer can only
guarantee the integrity up to the delivery procedure. It is in the responsibility of the
Composite Product Manufacturer to include mechanisms in the implemented software
(developed by the IC Embedded Software Developer) which allows detection of
modifications after the delivery.
In detail, regarding identification:
The Generic Chip Identification Mode (GCIM) can be activated after power-on with a
dedicated signalling sequence and is also accessible by the user software. This GCIM
outputs amongst other identifiers for the platform, chip mode, ROM code, chip type, design
step, fabrication facility, wafer, die position, firmware, temperature range, system
frequency and the CCI. The interpretation of the chip identification data is described in
[12], section 4.6.
Additionally, the customer can identify the present configuration by reading the relevant
data (see [13], section 7.9).
The SCL (optional), UMSLC and HSL library (optional), as separate software parts of the
TOE, are identified by their unique version numbers. The user can identify these versions



                                                                                                     13 / 29
Certification Report                                                      BSI-DSZ-CC-1126-2019




by calculating the hash signatures of the provided library files. The mapping of these hash
signatures to the version numbers is provided in [6] and [9], chapters 9‚Äì11.
In detail, regarding delivery:
‚ÄúTOE Delivery‚Äù is uniquely used to indicate
‚óè   after Phase 3 (or before Phase 4) if the TOE is delivered in form of wafers or sawn
    wafers (dice) or
‚óè   after Phase 4 (or before Phase 5) if the TOE is delivered in form of packaged products.
Therefore three different delivering procedures have to be taken into consideration:
‚óè   Delivery of the IC dedicated software components (IC dedicated SW, guidance) from the
    TOE manufacturer to the IC embedded software developer.
‚óè   Delivery of the IC embedded software (ROM / Flash data, initialisation and pre-
    personalization data, Bundle Business package) from the IC embedded software
    developer to the TOE manufacturer.
‚óè   Delivery of the final TOE from the TOE manufacturer to the composite product
    manufacturer. After phase 3 the TOE is delivered in form of wafers or sawn wafers, after
    phase 4 in form of modules (with or without inlay antenna).
The TOE is delivered via the logistics sites:
‚óè   DHL Singapore (Distribution Center Asia),
‚óè   G&D Neustadt,
‚óè   KWE Shanghai,
‚óè   K&N Gro√üostheim (Distribution Center Europe),
‚óè   IFX Morgan Hill.

3.      Security Policy
The security policy enforced is defined by the selected set of Security Functional
Requirements and implemented by the TOE. It covers the following issues:
The Security Policy of the TOE is to provide basic security functionalities to be used by the
smart card operating system and the smart card application, thus providing an overall
smart card system security. Therefore, the TOE will implement a symmetric cryptographic
block cipher algorithm (Triple-DES and AES) to ensure the confidentiality of plain text data
by encryption and to support secure authentication protocols and it will provide a True
Random Number Generator (TRNG).
The optional SCL provides TDES and AES cryptography, which is partly implemented on
the hardware component ŒºSCP and includes countermeasures against SPA, DPA and
DFA attacks. The SCL is delivered as object code and in this way integrated into the user
software.
The optional HSL provides functionality via APIs to the Smartcard Embedded Software,
which contains SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM service routines and functionality for tearing-safe
programming of SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM.
The UMSLC library provides a wrapper around the UMSLC hardware functionality with
some software measures to counter fault attacks.



                                                                                        14 / 29
BSI-DSZ-CC-1126-2019                                                        Certification Report




As the TOE is a hardware security platform, the security policy of the TOE is also to
provide protection against leakage of information (e.g. to ensure the confidentiality of
cryptographic keys during AES and Triple-DES cryptographic functions performed by the
TOE), against physical probing, against malfunctions, against physical manipulations and
against abuse of functionality. Hence the TOE shall
‚óè   maintain the integrity and the confidentiality of data stored in the memory of the TOE,
    and
‚óè   maintain the integrity, the correct operation and the confidentiality of security
    functionalities (security mechanisms and associated functions) provided by the TOE.
Specific details concerning the above mentioned security policies can be found in Chapter
7 of the Security Target [6] and [9].

4.      Assumptions and Clarification of Scope
The assumptions defined in the Security Target and some aspects of threats and
Organisational Security Policies are not covered by the TOE itself. These aspects lead to
specific security objectives to be fulfilled and measures to be taken by the IT environment,
the user or the risk manager. The following topics are of relevance:
The ST only includes one security objective for the IC Embedded Software Developer, the
objective OE.Resp-Appl.
The objective OE.Resp-Appl states that the IC Embedded Software Developer shall treat
user data (especially keys) appropriately. The IC Embedded Software Developer gets
sufficient information on how to protect user data adequate in the security guidelines [14].
The ST includes the following security objectives for the operational environment, which
are relevant for the Composite Product Manufacturer: OE.Process-Sec-IC,
OE.Lim_Block_Loader, OE.Loader_Usage and OE.TOE_Auth.
The objective OE.Process-Sec-IC requires the protection of the TOE, as well as of its
manufacturing and test data up to the delivery to the end-consumer. As defined in [6] and
[9] section 1.4.5, the TOE can be delivered to the composite product manufacturer after
phase 3 or after phase 4. However, the single chips are identical in all cases. This means
that the test mode is deactivated and the TOE is locked in the user mode. Therefore it is
not necessary to distinguish between these forms of delivery. Since Infineon has no
information about the security requirements of the implemented IC embedded software it is
not possible to define any concrete security requirements for the environment of the
composite product manufacturer.
The objective OE.TOE_Auth requires that the environment has to support the
authentication and verification mechanism and has to know the corresponding
authentication reference data. The composite product manufacturer receives sufficient
information with regard to the authentication mechanism in [16], section 4.2.2.
The objective OE.Loader_Usage requires that the authorised user has to support the
trusted communication with the TOE by protecting the confidentiality and integrity of the
loaded data and he has to meet the access conditions defined by the flash loader. [15],
section 4 provides sufficient information regarding this topic.
The objective OE.Lim_Block_Loader requires the composite product manufacturer to
protect the loader against misuse, to limit the capability of the loader and to terminate the
loader irreversibly after the intended usage. The permanent deactivation of the flash loader



                                                                                         15 / 29
Certification Report                                                      BSI-DSZ-CC-1126-2019




is described in [16], section 4.5.1.3. This objective for the environment originates from the
‚ÄúPackage 1: Loader dedicated for usage in secured environment only‚Äù. However, this TOE
also implements ‚ÄúPackage 2: Loader dedicated for usage by authorized users only‚Äù and
thus the flash loader can also be used in an unsecure environment and is able to protect
itself against misuse if the authentication and download keys are handled appropriately.

5.       Architectural Information
The TOE is a SmartCard (Security IC). Detailed information on the TOE hardware
architecture is to be found in [6] and [9] section 1.2, 1.3 and especially 1.4.

6.       Documentation
The evaluated documentation as outlined in table 2 is being provided with the product to
the customer. This documentation contains the required information for secure usage of
the TOE in accordance with the Security Target.
Additional obligations and notes for secure usage of the TOE as outlined in chapter 10 of
this report have to be followed.

7.       IT Product Testing
The developer performed the following categories of tests:
     ‚Ä¢   Simulation Tests (Design Verification),
     ‚Ä¢   Qualification Tests / Software Verification,
     ‚Ä¢   Verification Tests and
     ‚Ä¢   Production Tests.
The developer tests cover all security functionalities and all security mechanisms as
identified in the functional specification.
The evaluators were able to repeat the tests of the developer either using the library of
programs, tools and prepared chip samples delivered to the evaluator or at the developer‚Äôs
site. They performed independent tests to supplement, augment and to verify the tests
performed by the developer. For the developer tests repeated by the evaluators other test
parameters were used and the test equipment was varied. Security features of the TOE
realised by specific design and layout measures were checked by the evaluators during
layout inspections both in design data and on the final product.
The evaluation has shown that the actual version of the TOE provides the security
functionalities as specified by the developer. The test results confirm the correct
implementation of the TOE security functionalities.
For penetration testing the evaluators took all security functionalities into consideration.
Intensive penetration testing was planned based on the analysis results and performed
forthe underlying mechanisms of security functionalities. The penetration tests considered
both the physical tampering of the TOE and attacks which do not modify the TOE
physically. The penetration tests results confirm that the TOE is resistant to attackers with
high attack potential in the intended environment for the TOE.

8.      Evaluated Configuration
This certification covers the following configurations of the TOE:
  IFX_CCI_000Dh, IFX_CCI_0020h, IFX_CCI_0031h, IFX_CCI_0032h, IFX_CCI_0034h,
IFX_CCI_0037h design step T31 and M31 with optional HSL v2.62.7626, optional SCL
    version v2.04.003, UMSLC lib v01.00.0234 with specific IC-dedicated firmware
                       identifier 80.301.05.1 and user guidance
Hardware Configuration:
The hardware of the TOE can be ordered with different SOLID FLASH TM and RAM sizes
(up to 800 kBytes SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ and up to 20 kBytes RAM). The configuration (as listed
in [6] and [9] table 3 and 4) can be done during the manufacturing process of the TOE
according to the choice of the user. The TOE operating temperature range configuration
options are reflected by the different design steps M31 and T31.
Firmware Packages:
The firmware of the TOE comprises the BOS (FW identifier provided in table 2) and the
Flash Loader (version provided in Table 2). The latter can be configured in three different
ways as outlined in the following:
‚óè   Option 1: The user or/and a subcontractor downloads the software into the SOLID
    FLASH‚Ñ¢ memory. Infineon Technologies does not receive any user software.
    Result: Flash Loader can be activated or reactivated by the user or subcontractor to
    download software into the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ memory.
‚óè   Option 2: The user provides software to download into the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ memory to
    Infineon Technologies AG. The software is loaded into the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ memory
    during chip production.
    Result: No Flash Loader present.
‚óè   Option 3: The user provides software to download into the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ memory to
    Infineon Technologies AG. The software is loaded into the NVM memory during chip
    production.
    Result: Flash Loader is blocked by Infineon but can be activated or reactivated by the
    user or subcontractor to download software into the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ memory. The user
    is required to provide a reactivation procedure as part of the software to Infineon
    Technologies AG.
An overview about the different Flash Loader options is also given in [6] and [9], section
1.4.8.
Optional Software Libraries:
The TOE can be delivered with up to three software libraries, as described in [6] and [9]
section 1.4.1.2. All libraries are delivered as object code and in this way integrated into the
user software.
The optional software libraries listed in Table 2 can be combined according to the
demands of the user. Based on the library selection the TOE can be delivered with or
without the functionality of the HSL and/or SCL library. This is considered in the developer
documentation and corresponding notes are added where required.
If the user decides not to use the HSL and/or SCL library, it is not delivered to the user and
the accompanying additional specific security functionality as listed in Table 2 is not


                                                                                           17 / 29
Certification Report                                                       BSI-DSZ-CC-1126-2019




provided by the TOE. Upon deselection of a library the code implementing the functionality
is excluded and thus this functionality is not available to the user.
Excluding the code of the deselected functionality has no impact on any other security
policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the situation where the user decides just not to
use this functionality.
Evaluation scope:
The ITSEF tested the TOE in those configurations, in which the TOE is delivered, and
which are stated above (and in the ST [6] and [9]).

9.2.    Results of cryptographic assessment
The strength of the cryptographic algorithms was not rated in the course of this certification
procedure (see BSIG Section 9, Para. 4, Clause 2). But cryptographic functionalities with a
security level of lower than 100 bits can no longer be regarded as secure without
considering the application context. Therefore, for these functionalities it shall be checked
whether the related crypto operations are appropriate for the intended system. Some
further hints and guidelines can be derived from the 'Technische Richtlinie BSI TR-02102'
(https://www.bsi.bund.de).
The following table gives an overview of the cryptographic functionalities inside the TOE to
enforce the security policy and outlines its rating from cryptographic point of view. Any
Cryptographic Functionality that is marked in column 'Security Level above 100 Bits' of the
following table with 'no' achieves a security level of lower than 100 Bits (in general context)
only:

The Flash Loader's and the ICS‚Äô (internal ciphering system, see [6] and [9]) cryptographic
strength was not assessed by BSI. However, the evaluation according to the TOE's
Evaluation Assurance Level did not reveal any implementation weaknesses.
Please note, that this holds true also for those algorithms, where no cryptographic 100-Bit-
Level assessment was given. Consequently, the targeted Evaluation Assurance Level has
been achieved for those functionalities as well.
Detailed results on conformance have been compiled into the report [19].

10. Obligations and Notes for the Usage of the TOE
The documents as outlined in table 2 contain necessary information about the usage of the
TOE and all security hints therein have to be considered. In addition all aspects of
Assumptions, Threats and OSPs as outlined in the Security Target not covered by the TOE
itself need to be fulfilled by the operational environment of the TOE.
The customer or user of the product shall consider the results of the certification within his
system risk management process. In order for the evolution of attack methods and
techniques to be covered, he should define the period of time until a re-assessment of the
TOE is required and thus requested from the sponsor of the certificate.
The limited validity for the usage of cryptographic algorithms as outlined in chapter 9 has
to be considered by the user and his system risk management process, too.
Some security measures are partly implemented in this certified TOE, but require
additional configuration or control or measures to be implemented by a product layer on
top, e.g. the Embedded Software using the TOE. For this reason the TOE includes
guidance documentation (see table 2) which contains obligations and guidelines for the
developer of the product layer on top on how to securely use this certified TOE and which
measures have to be implemented in order to fulfil the security requirements of the
Security Target of the TOE. In the course of the evaluation of the composite product or
system it must be examined if the required measures have been correctly and effectively
implemented by the product layer on top. Additionally, the evaluation of the composite
product or system must also consider the evaluation results as outlined in the document
ETR for composite evaluation [10].
At the point in time when evaluation and certification results are reused there might be an
update of the document "ETR for composite evaluation" available. Therefore, the certified
products list on the BSI website has to be checked for latest information on
reassessments, recertifications or maintenance result available for the product.



                                                                                          21 / 29

The Security IC Embedded Software Developer receives all necessary recommendations
and hints to develop his software in form of the delivered documentation.
‚óè    All security hints described in the delivered documents [12]-[14] and [16]-[18] (also listed
     in Table 2) have to be considered.
The Composite Product Manufacturer receives all necessary recommendations and hints
to develop his software in form of the delivered documentation.
‚óè    All security hints described in [15] have to be considered.
In addition the following hints resulting from the evaluation of the ALC evaluation aspect
has to be considered:
‚óè    The IC Embedded Software Developer can deliver his software either to Infineon to let
     them implement it in the TOE (in Flash memory) or to the Composite Product
     Manufacturer to let him download the software in the Flash memory.
‚óè    The delivery procedure from the IC Embedded Software Developer to the Composite
     Product Manufacturer is not part of this evaluation and a secure delivery is required.

11.      Security Target
For the purpose of publishing, the Security Target [9] of the Target of Evaluation (TOE) is
provided within a separate document as Annex A of this report. It is a sanitised version of
the complete Security Target [6] used for the evaluation performed. Sanitisation was
performed according to the rules as outlined in the relevant CCRA policy (see AIS 35 [4]).

 TOE. No management of these security
attribute (i.e. SFR FMT_MSA.1 and FMT_MSA.3) is necessary here.
No. 2: A Diffie-Hellman key agreement is used in order to have no key distribution, therefore FCS_CKM.2
makes no sense in this case.77
No. 3: The Active Authentication key pair cannot be deleted or regenerated.

6.4.3 Security Assurance Requirements Rationale
The EAL5 was chosen to permit a developer to gain maximum assurance from positive security engineering
based on good commercial development practices and a Java card platform that offers cryptographic func-
tionality certified according to EAL5 or higher.
The selection of the component ALC_DVS.2 provides a higher assurance of the security of the travel docu-
ment‚Äôs development and manufacturing especially for the secure handling of the travel document‚Äôs mate-
rial.
The selection of the component AVA_VAN.5 provides a higher assurance of the security by vulnerability
analysis to assess the resistance to penetration attacks performed by an attacker possessing a high attack
potential. This vulnerability analysis is necessary to fulfil the security objectives OT.Sens_Data_Conf and
OT.Chip_Auth_Proof.
The component ALC_DVS.2 has no dependencies. The component AVA_VAN.5 has the following dependen-
cies:
         ÔÇ∑ ADV_ARC.1 Security architecture description
         ÔÇ∑ ADV_FSP.4 Complete functional specification
         ÔÇ∑ ADV_TDS.3 Basic modular design
         ÔÇ∑ ADV_IMP.1 Implementation representation of the TSF
         ÔÇ∑ AGD_OPE.1 Operational user guidance
         ÔÇ∑ AGD_PRE.1 Preparative procedures
All of these are met or exceeded in the EAL5 assurance package.



77   This justification was taken from [PP0068v2].

6.4.4 Security Requirements ‚Äì Mutual Support and Internal Consistency
This security target claims strict conformance to the Protection Profiles given insection 2.2. Therefore this
security target includes the analysis of the internal consistency of the Security Requirements of the Protec-
tion Profiles without repeating these here.
As the complete Security Problem Definition, the Extended Components and the Security Functional Re-
quirements have also been included, the consistency analysis of the Protection Profiles is also valid for this
security target.
The additions made to include the Active Authentication Mechansim have been integrated in a consistent
way to the model designed by the Protection Profiles, e. g. by using the subject, object and operation defi-
nitions.
Inconsistency between functional and assurance requirements could only arise if there are functional-as-
surance dependencies which are not met, a possibility which has been shown not to arise in sections 6.3.2
Dependency Rationale and 6.3.3 Security Assurance Requirements Rationale. Furthermore, as also dis-
cussed in section 6.3.3 Security
Assurance Requirements Rationale, the chosen assurance components are adequate for the functionality
of the TOE. So the assurance requirements and security functional requirements support each other and
there are no inconsistencies between the goals ofthese two groups of security requirements.

7.1 TOE Security Functionality

7.1.1 TSF_Access: Access Control
This security functionality manages the access to objects (files, directories, data and secrets) stored in the
applet‚Äôs file system. It also controls write access of initialization, pre-personalization and personalization
data. Access control for initialization and pre-personalization in Phase 2 ‚Äì while the actual applet is not yet
present ‚Äì is based on the card manager of the underlying JCOP4 P71 Java Card platform (SF.CM).
Access is granted (or denied) in accordance to access rights that depend on appropriate identification and
authentication mechanisms.
TSF_Access covers the following SFRs:
    ÔÇ∑   FIA_UID.1.1/PACE requires that the TSF shall allow to establish the communication channel, to carry
        out the PACE Protocol, to read the Initialization Data if it is not disabled by TSF according to
        FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS, to carry out the Chip Authentication Protocol, to carry out the Terminal Au-
        thentication Protocol, and to carry out the Active Authentication Mechanism on behalf of the user
        to be performed before the user is identified. FIA_UID.1.2 requires that the TSF shall require each
        user to be successfully identified before allowing any other TSF-mediated actions on behalf of that
        user. TSF_Access realizes the appropriate control of the access rights, TSF_Auth the authentication
        mechanisms.
    ÔÇ∑   FIA_UAU.1/PACE requires that the TSF shall allow to establish the communication channel, to carry
        out the PACE Protocol, to read the Initialization Data if it is not disabled by TSF according to
        FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS, to identify themselves by selection of the authentication key, to carry out the
        Chip Authentication Protocol, to carry out the Terminal Authentication Protocol, and to carry out
        the Active Authentication Mechanism on behalf of the user to be performed before the user is au-
        thenticated. FIA_UAU.1.2 requires that the TSF shall require each user to be successfully authenti-
        cated before allowing any other TSF-mediated actions on behalf of that user. TSF_Access realizes
        the appropriate control of the access rights.
    ÔÇ∑   FIA_UAU.4/PACE requires that the TSF shall prevent reuse of authentication data related to the
        PACE Protocol, the Terminal Authentication Protocol, and the Authentication Mechanism based on
        AES. TSF_Access realizes the appropriate control of the access rights.
    ÔÇ∑   FIA_UAU.5.1/PACE requires that the TSF shall provide the PACE Protocol, Passive Authentication,
        Terminal Authentication, Secure messaging in MAC-ENC mode, Symmetric Authentication Mecha-
        nism based on AES, and the Terminal Authentication Protocol to support user authentication.
        FIA_UAU.5.2/PACE requires that the TSF shall authenticate any user‚Äôs claimed identity according to
        specified rules. TSF_Access realizes the appropriate control of the access rights.
    ÔÇ∑   FIA_UAU.6/PACE requires that the TSF shall re-authenticate the user under the condition that each
        command sent to the TOE after successful run of the PACE Protocol shall be verified as being sent
        by the terminal. TSF_Access realizes the appropriate control of the access rights.
    ÔÇ∑   FIA_UAU.6/EAC requires that the TSF shall re-authenticate the user under the condition that each
        command sent to the TOE after successful run of the Chip Authentication Protocol shall be verified
        as being sent by the Inspection System. TSF_Access realizes the appropriate control of the access
        rights.
    ÔÇ∑   FDP_ACC.1/TRM requires that the TSF shall enforce the Access Control SFP on terminals gaining
        access to the User data and data stored in EF.Sod of the logical travel document.. TSF_Access real-
        izes the appropriate control of the access rights.

                       The IC hardware platform P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF is a microcontroller
                       incorporating a central processing unit, memories accessible via a Memory Management
                       Unit, cryptographic coprocessors, other security components and two communication
                       interfaces. The central processing unit supports a 32-/24-/16-/8-bit instruction set optimized
                       for smart card applications, which is a super set of the 80C51 family instruction set. The first
                       and in some cases the second byte of an instruction are used for operation encoding. On-
                       chip memories are ROM, RAM and EEPROM. The non-volatile EEPROM can be used as
                       data or program memory. It consists of high reliable memory cells, which guarantee data
                       integrity. The EEPROM is optimized for applications requiring reliable non-volatile data
                       storage for data and program code. EEPROM double read function is included for correct
                       memory readout. Dedicated security functionality protects the contents of all memories.
                       The security functionality of the TOE is designed to act as an integral part of a complete
                       security system in order to strengthen the design as a whole. Several security mechanisms
                       are completely implemented in and controlled by the TOE. Other security mechanisms allow
                       for configuration or even require handling of exceptions by the Security IC Embedded
                       Software. The different CPU modes and the Memory Management Unit support the
                       implementation of multi-application projects using the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF.
                       A Security IC must provide high security in particular when being used in the banking and
                       finance market, in electronic commerce or in governmental applications because the TOE
                       is intended to be used in a potential insecure environment. Hence the TOE shall maintain
                           ‚Ä¢ the integrity and the confidentiality of code and data stored in its memories and
                           ‚Ä¢ the different CPU modes with the related capabilities for configuration and memory
                             access and
                           ‚Ä¢ the integrity, the correct operation and the confidentiality of security functionality
                             provided by the TOE.
                       This is ensured by the construction of the TOE and its security functionality.
                       P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF basically provides a hardware platform for an
                       implementation of a smart card application with
                           ‚Ä¢ functionality to calculate the Data Encryption Standard (Triple-DES) with up to three
                             keys,
                           ‚Ä¢ functionality to calculate the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with different key
                             lengths,
                           ‚Ä¢ support for large integer arithmetic operations like multiplication, addition and logical
                             operations, which are suitable for public key cryptography and elliptic curve
                             cryptography,
                           ‚Ä¢ a True Random Number Generator,
                           ‚Ä¢ memory management control,
                           ‚Ä¢ cyclic redundancy check (CRC) calculation,
                           ‚Ä¢ ISO/IEC 7816 contact interface with UART,
                           ‚Ä¢ ISO/IEC 14443 A contactless interface.
                       In addition, several security mechanisms are implemented to ensure proper operation as
                       well as integrity and confidentiality of stored data. For example, this includes security
                       mechanisms for memory protection and security exceptions as well as sensors, which allow

                       operation under specified conditions only. Memory encryption is used for memory protection
                       and chip shielding is added to the chip.
                       Note:        Large integer arithmetic operations are intended to be used for calculation of
                                    asymmetric cryptographic algorithms. Any asymmetric cryptographic
                                    algorithm utilizing the support for large integer arithmetic operations has to be
                                    implemented in the Security IC Embedded Software. Thus, the support for
                                    large integer arithmetic operations itself does not provide security functionality
                                    like cryptographic support. The Security IC Embedded Software implementing
                                    an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm is not included in this evaluation.
                                    Nevertheless the support for large integer arithmetic operations is part of the
                                    Security IC and therefore a security relevant component of the TOE, that must
                                    resist to the attacks mentioned in this Security Target and that must operate
                                    correctly as specified in the data sheet. The same scope of evaluation is
                                    applied to the CRC calculation.


                  1.3.2 TOE type
                       The P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF is provided as IC hardware platform for various
                       operating systems and applications with high security requirements.

                       The TOE consists of the IC hardware platform and Security IC Dedicated Software as
                       composed of Security IC Dedicated Test Software and Security IC Dedicated Support
                       Software. The Security IC Dedicated Test Software contains the Test-ROM Software; the
                       Security IC Dedicated Support Software contains the Boot-ROM Software and the
                       Firmware Operating System.All other software is called Security IC Embedded Software.
                       The Security IC Embedded Software is not part of the TOE.
                       The IC Dedicated Support Software consists of Boot-ROM Software controlling the boot
                       process of the hardware platform and the Firmware Operating System which can be called
                       by the Security IC Embedded Software.
                       The Firmware Operating System for the hardware platform is called the Plain Firmware
                       Operating System (FOS-Plain) and the Firmware Operating System for the MIFARE
                       Software Emulation is called the Emulation Firmware Operating System (FOS- Emu).
                       The FOS-Plain provides an interface for programming of the internal EEPROM memory,
                       which is mandatory for use by the Security IC Embedded Software when programming the
                       EEPROM memory. Furthermore FOS-Plain provides an interface for the Post Delivery
                       Configuration functionality.
                       All configurations other than P60D024/016/012P include emulation MIFARE Plus
                       MF1PLUSx0 or MIFARE DESFire EV1 in the FOS-Emu. These emulations are represented
                       by the term MIFARE Software in this document. Note that MIFARE Software is not part of
                       the TOE (see Fig 2).

                         Release VB(Y) can be identified by ROM Code number xxx in the range of 005 to 013 and 092 to 095. All
                            other ROM Code numbers are assigned to version VB(Z) and VB(A). The ROM code number can
                            unambiguously identified by reading Security Row bytes RCN0 (DFFF8A) and RCN1 (DFF8B), see [9].
                            In addition, the ROM Code number is physically visible on the dice surface according to [12]. Releases

                            compared to VB(Y). Compared to Release VB(Z) the release VB(A) introduces additional configuration
                            option. Releases VB(Z), and VB(A) can be distinguished by the Device Coding of ‚ÄúNXP option of

                           7816 contact interface and the ISO/IEC 14443 contactless interface. Their major differences
                           are related to the availability of EEPROM space. The ‚Äò024‚Äô, ‚Äò016‚Äô and ‚Äò012‚Äô specify the
                           accessible EEPROM memory.
                           The ‚Äòy‚Äô indicates the selection of the Firmware Operating System (FOS). It is a placeholder for
                           either ‚ÄòP‚Äô, ‚ÄòM‚Äô or ‚ÄòD‚Äô:

                          Table 8. The availability of minor configuration options partly depends on the selected major
                          configuration option. However, in general the minor configuration options can be chosen
                          independently.
                1.4.2.3     Post Delivery Configuration
                          Post Delivery Configuration (PDC) can be applied by the customer himself after the TOE
                          has been delivered to that customer. These options can be used to tailor the TOE to the
                          specific customer requirements. The Post Delivery Configuration can be changed multiple
                          times but must be set permanently by the customer before the TOE is delivered to phase 7
                          of the life cycle.
                          The Post Delivery Configuration for the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF is listed in Table
                          9.

1 ST Introduction
The aim of this document is to describe the Security Target for IDeal Pass v2.3ct against new attack methods needs to be re-assessed.
Therefore, the sponsor should apply for the certified product being monitored within the
assurance continuity program of the BSI Certification Scheme (e.g. by a re-assessment or
re-certification). Specifically, if results of the certification are used in subsequent evaluation
and certification procedures, in a system integration process or if a user's risk
management needs regularly updated results, it is recommended to perform a re-
assessment on a regular e.g. annual basis.
In order to avoid an indefinite usage of the certificate when evolved attack methods would
require a re-assessment of the products resistance to state of the art attack methods, the
maximum validity of the certificate has been limited. The certificate issued on 12 February
2020 is valid until 11 February 2025. Validity can be re-newed by re-certification.
The owner of the certificate is obliged:

     1. when advertising the certificate or the fact of the product's certification, to refer to
        the Certification Report as well as to provide the Certification Report, the Security
        Target and user guidance documentation mentioned herein to any customer of the
        product for the application and usage of the certified product,
     2. to inform the Certification Body at BSI immediately about vulnerabilities of the
        product that have been identified by the developer or any third party after issuance
        of the certificate,
     3. to inform the Certification Body at BSI immediately in the case that security relevant
        changes in the evaluated life cycle, e.g. related to development and production sites
        or processes, occur, or the confidentiality of documentation and information related
        to the Target of Evaluation (TOE) or resulting from the evaluation and certification
        procedure where the certification of the product has assumed this confidentiality
        being maintained, is not given any longer. In particular, prior to the dissemination of
        confidential documentation and information related to the TOE or resulting from the
        evaluation and certification procedure that do not belong to the deliverables
        according to the Certification Report part B, or for those where no dissemination
        rules have been agreed on, to third parties, the Certification Body at BSI has to be
        informed.
In case of changes to the certified version of the product, the validity can be extended to
the new versions and releases, provided the sponsor applies for assurance continuity (i.e.
re-certification or maintenance) of the modified product, in accordance with the procedural
requirements, and the evaluation does not reveal any security deficiencies.

usable. Rendering the last SCD in the TOE per-
manently unusable ends the life of the TOE as SSCD.
The TOE may support functions to generate additional signing keys. If the TOE supports these functions it
will support further functions to securely obtain certificates for the new keys. For an additional key the
signatory may be allowed to choose the kind of certificate (qualified, or not) to obtain for the SVD of the
new key. The signatory may also be allowed to choose some of the data in the certificate request for in-
stance to use a pseudonym instead of the legal name in the certificate5. If the conditions to obtain a quali-
fied certificate are met, the new key can also be used to create advanced electronic signatures. The optional
TOE functions for additional key generation and certification may require additional security functions in
the TOE and an interaction with the SSCD-provisioning service provider in an environment that is secure.
The TOE life cycle as SSCD ends when all SCD stored in the TOE are destructed. This may include deletion of
the corresponding certificates.

for optimized contactless communication. The ROM and SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM areas storing the RFAPI functions
are access protected and only the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM part, which is not part of the TOE, implements the user
interface. The RFAPI is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

This TOE implements a Hybrid Random Number Generator (HRNG). This HRNG equals to the expression Hybrid
Physical True Random Number Generator (hybrid PTRNG) as defined by the BSI. In the following, the BSI
expression hybrid PTRNG is used. The hybrid PTRNG implements a true physical random source and has
evidenced its conformance to the classes of AIS31 [13] as declared in chapter 7.1.1.1.
The produced genuine random numbers are available as a security service for the user and are also used for
internal purposes. Together with the guidelines in [6] the hybrid PTRNG operates in the following modes of
operation and is conformant to the named classes:
    ÔÇ∑ True Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.2
    ÔÇ∑ Hybrid Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.3
    ÔÇ∑ Deterministic Random Number Generation (DRNG) AIS31 DRG.3
    ÔÇ∑ Key Stream Generation (KSG), stream cipher generation AIS31 DRG.2
The hybrid PTRNG is deemed for any application requiring excellent physical random data entropy.

   ÔÇ∑ The symmetric co-processor (SCP) combines both AES and DES with one, two or triple-key hardware
       acceleration. Please note that the single DES algorithm is not in the scope of evaluation due to national
       regulation by BSI.
   ÔÇ∑ And, the Asymmetric Crypto Co-processor, called Crypto@2304T, provides optimized high performance
       calculations for the user software executing cryptographic operations and is also used by the optional
       cryptographic libraries for Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and Elliptic Curve (EC) cryptography.

The optional software parts are differentiated into following libraries:
   ÔÇ∑ The asymmetric cryptographic libraries (ACL) in following alternative versions:
       v2.08.007, v2.07.003 and v2.06.003.
           o All ACL libraries provide RSA1 2048/4096 cryptography.
                The library supports also smaller key lengths, but the certification follows the national regulation

Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)


    ÔÇ∑   the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ Cryptographic Library (CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL and CCL) in the version v02.00.0004 provides the
        user OSPT alliance CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ V2 conformant communication functionality between a PICC and a PCD
    ÔÇ∑   the NRG Software. The NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

The RSA cryptographic library, regardless of the version chosen:
    ÔÇ∑ provides a high level interface to the hardware component Crypto2304T and includes countermeasures
        against fault injection and side channel attacks.
    ÔÇ∑ implements the generation of RSA Key Pairs (RsaKeyGen), the RSA signature verification (RsaVerify),
        the RSA signature generation (RsaSign) and the RSA modulus recalculation (RsaModulus). This RSA
        library can perform RSA operations from 512 to 4096 bits.
    ÔÇ∑ implements the high level interface to hardware cryptographic coprocessor Crypto2304T which runs the
        basic long number calculations (add, subtract, multiply, square) with high performance.
The RSA library is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software.
Following the national BSI recommendations, RSA key lengths below 1976 bits are not included in the certificate.
Please note that the BSI expects this key length as appropriate until 2022 and recommends for longer usage
times key lengths of 3000 bits or higher.

The EC library, regardless of the version chosen:
    ÔÇ∑ provides a high level interface to Elliptic Curve Cryptography computed on the hardware component
        Crypto2304T and includes countermeasures against fault injection and side channel attacks.
    ÔÇ∑ implements routines for ECDSA signature generation, for ECDSA signature verification, ECDSA key
        generation and for the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement.
    ÔÇ∑ In addition, the EC library provides an additional function for calculating primitive elliptic curve
        operations like ECC Add and ECC Double.
    ÔÇ∑ EC curves over prime field Fp, as well as over GF(2n) finite field are supported too.
The EC library is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software.
The security functional requirement covers the standard Brainpool [19] and NIST [26] Elliptic Curves with key
lengths of 160, 163, 192, 224, 233, 256, 283, 320, 384, 409, 512 or 521 bits.
The definition of the key lengths follows the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100 bit security level by the
BSI.
Numerous other curve types, being also secure in terms of side channel attacks on this TOE, exist, which the user
optionally can add in the composition certification process.

If the user decides not to use any of the offered cryptographic library(s), regardless of the version, none of the
cryptographic libraries is consequently delivered and the accompanying Additional Specific Security
Functionality (O.Add-Functions) Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and/ or EC is/are not provided by the TOE. Else it
depends of the chosen library whether the Additional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions) Rivest-
Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and/ or EC is/are supported.

The Toolbox library, regardless of the version chosen, does not provide cryptographic support or additional
security functionality as it provides only the following basic long integer arithmetic and modular functions in
software, supported by the cryptographic coprocessor: Addition, subtraction, division, multiplication,
comparison, reduction, modular addition, modular subtraction, modular multiplication, modular inversion and
modular exponentiation. No security relevant policy, mechanism or function is supported. The Toolbox library is
deemed for software developers as support for simplified implementation of long integer and modular
arithmetic operations. The Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

The symmetric cryptographic library SCL offers a high level interface to perform the cryptographic operations
DES, TDES and AES with different key lengths on the symmetric cryptographic coprocessor (SCP) for this TOE.

In addition, the SCL implements MAC computation of a CMAC, using AES and 3DES algorithms, respectively a
RetailMAC using the DES algorithm.
The SCL implements already several block cipher modes as declared in this document and covers a wide range of
applications, but the SCL offers in addition the flexibility to implement additional user defined block cipher
modes.
Both library versions provide a simplified interface to the hardware Symmetric Cryptographic Coprocessor (SCP)
and preserve the security and performance requirements as required by the user.
Even in the basic configuration the SCL meets the tarlse it depends of the chosen library whether the Additional Specific Security Functionality
(O.Add-Functions) Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and/ or EC is/are supported.

The Toolbox library, regardless of the version chosen, provides the user optionally basic arithmetic and modular
arithmetic operations, in order to support user software development using long integer operations. These basic
arithmetic operations do not provide security functionality, implement no security mechanism, and do not
proved additional specific security functionality ‚Äì as defined for the cryptographic libraries.
The user developed software using the Toolbox basic operations is not part of the TOE.
The Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

The symmetric cryptographic library SCL ‚Äì in both versions ‚Äì offers a high level interface to perform the
cryptographic operations DES, TDES and AES with different key lengths on the symmetric cryptographic

Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)


The SCL implements already several bgeted security level, which can be further increased by
simple means of configuration options.
The key lengths used for the AES and DES functionality follow the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100
bit security level issued by the BSI1. This regulation excludes the single DES operation from the certification as it
is considered to be not sufficiently secure from algorithm perspective.
For both versions, the certification covers the SCL cryptographic functionality of the AES algorithm with key
lengths of 128, 192, 256 bits and the TDEA or TripleDES (TDES) algorithm with an effective key size of 112 and
168 bits. For the version v2.04.002 the certification covers the CMAC functionality too.

Note that this TOE can come with both cryptographic co-processors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a
blocked Crypto2304T, or with both cryptographic co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the user‚Äôs
choice. No accessibility of the deselected cryptographic co-processors is without impact on any other security
policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the situation where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic
co-processors.

Beside the inclusion and support of cryptographic libraries this TOE comes with the optional Hardware Support
Library (HSL) in different alternative versions, significantly simplifying the management of the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢
NVM functionality. The HSL constitutes an application interface (API) accessing the HSL state machine and
abstracting low level properties like special function registers and settings of specific hardware features. In short
the HSL provides a user friendly also use case oriented interface considering endurance, reliability and
performance. In certain configurations the HSL provides also functions implementing tearing safe behaviour of
the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM. If used the user has no need to care about cases where the TOE is suddenly cut off the
power supply even during managing the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM.
Anyhow, the HSL remains as an optional library as even sudden power off situations does never lead to
exploitable conditions of the TOE. In the worse the TOE ends operation in case of a faulty programmed SOLID
FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM location due to the Integrity Guard.
In addition to the above, the HSL in version 03.12.8812 and 03.11.8339 provide an advanced additional method
called Incremental Write (IWR). This method provides enhanced endurance of the SOLID FLASH NVM even
beyond the erase endurance limits for often written objects. Thus this method serves applications with a demand
for high endurance and fast writing times. On the other hand, the read times using this method are slower than
the other methods provided.

The order option CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ Cryptographic Library (CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL) provides cryptographic functionality to
implement a CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ V2 conformant protocol.
This protocol provides a secure mutual authentication of two entities, namely the terminal (denoted as PCD =
Proximity Coupling Device (CIPURSE‚Ñ¢-compliant terminal)) and a smart card or a token in other form factors
which is called PICC. PICC stands for Proximity Integrated Circuit Card (CIPURSE‚Ñ¢-compliant card).
Beside the mutual authentication, the protocol implements measures to maintain the integrity of the transferred
data and preserves in parallel the confidentiality of the transferred data.
By that the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL supports the user to implement systems conformant to the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ open standard
implementing a secured, interoperable and flexible transit fare collection solution, including ISO 7816, ISO/IEC
14443-4 communication and AES-128 bit cryptography for multiple payment types.

Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)


By that the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL supports the user to implement systems conformant to the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ open standard
implementing a secured, interoperable and flexible transit fare collection solution, including ISO 7816, ISO/IEC
14443-4 communication and AES-128 bit cryptography for multiple payment types.
The order option of the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL is conformant to the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ open standard [18] for both, the PICC and
then PCD software parts. It implements the by the OSPT alliance standardized application interface for the card
and the terminal side.
The scope of this certification of this TOE covers all parts of the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL which are later implemented by
the user on the user card respectively token based on this TOE and the functionality of the PCD software part
which is implemented in the terminal side. The PCD software operates also on the hardware of this TOE which is
implemented in the terminal.
The CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL implements the by the OSPT alliance standardized application interface for the card and the
terminal side.

The NRG Software is a further order option and implements the routines for a NRG interface. The NRG
implements an operating system handling the emulation of an NRG card together with the RF interface. One
part of the NRG is permanently stored in the ROM and the second part consisting of patch and API is located in
the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM. The second part is only present if the NRG is part of the delivery. If the NRG is not part
of the delivery the ROM part is present but not used. The NRG implements tearing safe behaviour in context with
the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM management and is therefore independent from the HSL. The NRG is not part of the
TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

To fulfill the highest security requirements for smartcards today and also in the future, this TOE implements a
progressive digital security concept, which already has been certified in various forerunner processes. This TOE
utilizes digital security features to include customer friendly security, combined with a robust design overcoming
the disadvantages on analogue protection technologies. The TOE provides full on-chip encryption covering the
complete core, busses, memories and cryptographic co-processors leaving no plain data on the chip. A further
security feature has been implemented for this TOE protecting also the involved addresses transferred over the
memory bus. Therefore the attractiveness for attackers is a step further extremely reduced as encrypted signals
are of no use for the attacker ‚Äì neither for manipulation nor for eavesdropping.
In addition, the TOE is equipped with a comprehensive error detection capability for the complete data path. The
dual CPU approach allows error detection even while processing. A comparator detects whether a calculation
was performed without errors. This approach does not leave any parts of the core circuitry unprotected. The
concept allows that the relevant attack scenarios are detected, whereas other conditions that would not lead to
an error would mainly be ignored. That renders the TOE robust against environmental influences.
Furthermore, the TOE implements what we call intelligent implicit shielding (I2). These measures constitute a
shield on sensitive and security critical signals which is not recognizable or obvious as a shield. This provides
excellent protection against invasive physical attacks, such as probing, forcing or similar.
In this Security Target the TOE is briefly described and a summary specification is given. The security
environment of the TOE durlock cipher modes as declared in this document and covering a wide range
of applications, the SCL offers in addition the flexibility to implement additional block cipher modes defined by
the user.
This library provides a simplified interface to the hardware Symmetric Cryptographic Coprocessor (SCP) and
preserves the security and performance requirements as required by the user.
Note that the definition of the key lengths follows the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100 bit security
level by the BSI. This excludes the single DES operation from the certification.

Beside the inclusion and support of cryptographic libraries this TOE comes with the optional Hardware Support
Library (HSL) in different versions significantly simplifying the management of the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM
functionality. The HSL constitutes an application interface (API) accessing the HSL state machine and
abstracting low level properties like special function registers and settings of specific hardware features. In short
the HSL provides a user friendly also useing its different phases of the lifecycle is defined. The assets are identified which
have to be protected through the security policy. The threats against these assets are described. The security
objectives and the security policy are defined, as well as the security requirements. These security requirements
are built out of the security functional requirements as part of the security policy and the security assurance
requirements. These are the formal steps applied during the evaluation and certification showing that the TOE
meets the targeted requirements. In additi case oriented interface considering endurance, reliability and
performance requirements.
In certain configurations each of the HSL versions provide also functions implementing tearing safe behavon, simplified functionality of the TOE matching the requirements is
described.
