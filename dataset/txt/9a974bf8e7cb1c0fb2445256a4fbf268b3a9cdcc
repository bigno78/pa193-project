                                                                                                                   Security Target Lite


                      by means of sensors. There are multiple voltage and frequency sensors for the different
                      ISO/IEC 7816 voltage classes and the contactless operation mode. Light sensors are
                      distributed over the chip surface and used to detect light attacks. In addition to the light
                      sensors the EEPROM provides two functions to detect light attacks. The Security IC
                      Embedded Software can enable/disable the EEPROM double read function.
                      Specific functional units of the P6022y VB are equipped with further fault injection
                      detection. This comprises the Secure Fetch for the processing of code and data by the
                      CPU or special circuitry within a functional unit. The functional units are the Program
                      Counter, the stack pointer, the CPU control register, the MMU address cache and control
                      registers, the SBC interface for the Triple-DES and the AES coprocessors, the Fame2
                      coprocessor, Copy Machine control registers and hardware configuration as well as test
                      control registers. Furthermore the P6022y VB contains a watchdog timer which can be
                      enabled and configured by the Security IC Embedded Software to protect the program
                      execution.
                      If one of the monitored parameters is out of the specified range, either (i) a reset is forced
                      and the actually running program is aborted or (ii) an exception is raised which interrupts
                      the program flow and allows a reaction of the Security IC Embedded Software. In case
                      minor configuration option “Inverse EEPROM Error Correction” is enabled (see Section
                      1.4.2.2) the probability to detect fault injection attack detectors at the EEPROM memory
                      and interface increases and the error correction logic raises an exception when detecting
                      an error. The RAM memory is equipped with additional parity bits which are checked
                      when the corresponding data stored in RAM is read. Additionally a RAM parity watchdog
                      mechanism is supported which checks the parity bits of the complete RAM in random
                      order when the Security IC Embedded Software is not accessing the RAM. In case of
                      detected RAM parity attack detectors both mechanisms trigger a security reset. In case
                      the P6022y VB processes a reset all components of the P6022y VB are initialised with
                      their reset values and the P6022y VB provides a reset cause indicator to the Security IC
                      Embedded Software. In the case an exception is raised an indicator for the reason of the
                      exception is provided. The P6022y VB defends the sensors from being disabled by the
                      Security IC Embedded Software.
                      The P6022y VB controls the specified range of the stack pointer. The stack pointer and
                      the related control logic are implemented threefold for the User Mode, System Mode
                      and Super System Mode (comprising Boot Mode, Test Mode and Firmware Mode). An
                      exception is generated in case the specified limits are exceeded.
                      In addition, SF.OPC comprises a sensor, which checks the high voltage of the write
                      process to the EEPROM during each write sequence. The result of this sensor must
                      be read from a Special Function Register and does not force an automatic event (e.g.
                      exception).
                      SF.PHY: Protection against Physical Manipulation
                      SF.PHY protects the P6022y VB against manipulation of (i) the IC hardware, (ii) the
                      IC Dedicated Software in ROM, (iii) the Security IC Embedded Software in ROM and
                      EEPROM, (iv) the Application Data in EEPROM and RAM including TSF data in the
                      Security Rows. It also protects User Data and TSF data against disclosure by physical
                      probing when stored or while being processed by the P6022y VB.
                      The protection of the P6022y VB comprises several security mechanisms in design and
                      construction, which make reverse-engineering and tamper attacks more difficult. These
                      mechanisms comprise dedicated shielding techniques for the P6022y VB and specific
                      encryption- and check mechanisms for the memories and internal buses. SF.PHY
                      supports the efficiency of other portions of the security functionality.

                                                                                                                  P6022y VB
                                                                                                                  Security Target Lite


                      SF.PHY also supports the integrity of the EEPROM, RAM and the ROM. The EEPROM
                      is able to correct a 1-bit error within each byte. The EEPROM corrects these attack
                      detectors automatically without user interaction. The RAM and the ROM provide a parity
                      check. In both cases a reset is forced based on a parity error.
                      The CRC coprocessor is used in Boot Mode by the IC dedicated Software for calculation
                      of a CRC checksum for integrity protection of TSF data.
                      SF.PUF: User Data Protection using PUF
                      SF.PUF implements a mechanism to seal/unseal the user data stored in shared
                      memory against unintended disclosure. SF.PUF encrypts/decrypts the user data with
                      a cryptographic key derived from the PUF data. SF.PUF calculates a MAC as a PUF
                      authentication value. SF.PUF provides this sealing/unsealing mechanism through the
                      specified interfaces FVEC2 (see Fig. 2) only.
                      SF.LOG: Logical Protection
                      SF.LOG implements security mechanisms to limit or eliminate the information in the
                      shape and amplitude of signals or in the time between events, which might be found by
                      measuring such signals. This comprises the power supply, signals on other pads, which
                      are not intentionally used for communication by the terminal or the Security IC Embedded
                      Software as well as emanation of the hardware platform. Thereby SF.LOG prevents from
                      disclosure of User Data and TSF data stored and/or processed in the Security IC through
                      measurement of power consumption or emanation and subsequent complex signal
                      analysis. This protection of the P6022y VB is enforced by several security mechanisms in
                      the design, which support these portions of security functionality.
                      The Triple-DES coprocessor includes specific security mechanisms to prevent SPA/
                      DPA analysis of shape and amplitude of the power consumption and emanation. The
                      implementation of the Triple-DES coprocessor further ensures that the calculation time is
                      independent from the chosen key value and plain/cipher text.
                      The AES coprocessor includes specific security mechanisms to prevent SPA/DPA
                      analysis of shape and amplitude of the power consumption and emanation. The
                      implementation of the AES coprocessor further ensures that the calculation time is
                      independent from the chosen key any plain/cipher text for a given key length.
                      The Fame2 coprocessor provides measures to prevent timing attacks on basic modular
                      function. The calculation time of an operation depends on the lengths of the operands,
                      but not on the value of the operands, with the following exceptions: multiplication with
                      reduction, modular inversion and modular division. These three operations have no
                      constant timing due to correction cycles that are needed based on the calculation
                      method. In addition, mechanisms are included, which provide limitations of the capability
                      for the analysis of shape and amplitude of the power consumption. Of course the Fame2
                      coprocessor does not realise an algorithm on its own and algorithm-specific leakage
                      countermeasures have to be added by the Security IC Embedded Software when using
                      the Fame2 coprocessor.
                      Additional security mechanisms can be configured by the Security IC Embedded
                      Software. This comprises the configuration of the clock that can be used to prevent the
                      synchronisation between internal operations and external clock or characteristics of the
                      power consumption that can be used as trigger signal to support leakage attacks (DPA or
                      timing attacks)
                      Some mechanisms described for SF.PHY (e.g. the encryption mechanisms) and for
                      SF.OPC (e.g. the filter mechanisms) support SF.LOG.

                                                                                                                   Security Target Lite


                      SF.COMP provides control of the CPU mode for (i) Boot Mode, (ii) Test Mode and
                      (iii) Firmware Mode. This includes protection of electronic fuses stored in a protected
                      memory area, the so-called Security Rows, and the possibility to store initialisation or
                      pre-personalisation data in the so-called FabKey Area.
                      Control of the CPU mode for Boot Mode, Test Mode and Firmware Mode prevents abuse
                      of test functions after TOE delivery. It also inhibits abuse of features, which are used
                      during start-up or reset to configure the P6022y VB.
                      The integrity control of electronic fuses ensures secure storage and setup of
                      configuration and calibration data, during the start-up in Boot Mode. The protection
                      of electronic fuses especially ensures that configuration options with regard to the
                      security functionality cannot be changed, abused or influenced in any way. The transfer
                      of the content of the electronic fuses into the related hardware configuration registers
                      is protected by a CRC checksum generated using the CRC coprocessor. SF.COMP
                      ensures that activation or deactivation of security mechanisms cannot be influenced by
                      the Security IC Embedded Software so that the TSF provides self-protection against
                      interference and tampering by untrusted Security IC Embedded Software.
                      SF.COMP protects CPU mode switches regarding Boot Mode, Test Mode and Firmware
                      Mode in the following way: Switching from Boot Mode to Test Mode or Firmware Mode is
                      allowed, switching from these modes back to Boot Mode is prevented. Switching to Test
                      Mode is prevented as well after TOE delivery, because Test Mode then is permanently
                      disabled. SF.COMP also ensures that Boot Mode is active only in the boot phase during
                      start-up or reset of the P6022y VB, and cannot be invoked afterwards. Therefore, once
                      the P6022y VB has left the test phase and each time the P6022y VB completed start-up
                      or reset, Firmware Mode is the only Super System Mode available.
                      The TSF controls access to the Security Rows, the top-most 512 Bytes of the EEPROM
                      memory, accessible at reserved addresses in the memory map. The available EEPROM
                      memory space for the Security IC Embedded Software is reduced by this area.
                      SF.COMP provides three memory areas in the Security Rows, which can be used by the
                      Security IC Embedded Software. These are
                      • the User Read Only Area
                      • the User Write Protected Area and
                      • the User Write Once Area.
                      The User Read Only Area contains 32 bytes, which are read-only for the Security IC
                      Embedded Software. The User Write Protected area contains 16 bytes, which can be
                      write-protected by the Security IC Embedded Software on demand. The User Write Once
                      Area contains 32 bytes of which each bit can separately be set to ‘1’ once only, and not
                      reset to ‘0’.
                      SF.COMP also provides a memory area in the Security Row where the current values
                      for the Post Delivery Configuration (see SS.RECONFIG). This area cannot be accessed
                      by the Security IC Embedded Software, but it can be accessed by the Resource
                      Configuration Firmware.
                      If minor configuration option “Card Disable” feature is used (refer to section 1.4.2.2)
                      SF.COMP inhibits any start-up of the Security IC Embedded Software once the Security
                      IC Embedded Software disables the card.
                      If minor configuration option “EEPROM application content erase” is used (see Section
                      1.4.2.2) SF.COMP erases the application data stored in the EEPROM once the Security
                      IC Embedded Software has activated this security feature.

                      SF.COMP also provides the FabKey Area where initialisation and identification data can
                      be stored. The FabKey area does not belong to the Security Rows and is not protected
                      by hardware mechanisms. The FabKey Area as well as the Security Rows can be used
                      by SF.COMP to store a unique identification for each die.
                      The complete EEPROM is initialized during wafer testing and pre-personalisation. The
                      values for the Security Row depend on the configuration options and choice of the
                      Security IC Embedded Software developer. The values for the application EEPROM
                      depend on the choice of the Security IC Embedded Software developer and are
                      included in the Order Entry Form. The User Write Protected Area and the User Write
                      Once Area are designed to store the identification of a (fully personalised) Security IC
                      (e.g. smartcard) or a sequence of events over the life-cycle, that can be coded by an
                      increasing number of bits set to "one" or protecting bytes, respectively.
                      SF.COMP limits the capabilities of the test functions and provides test personnel during
                      phase 3 with the capability to store identification and/or pre-personalisation data and/or
                      supplements of the Security IC Embedded Software in the EEPROM. SF.COMP provides
                      self-protection against interference and tampering by untrusted subjects both in the Test
                      Mode and in the other modes. It also enforces the separation of domains regarding the
                      IC Dedicated Software and the Security IC Embedded Software.
                      SF.MEM_ACC: Memory Access Control
                      SF.MEM_ACC controls access of any subject (program code comprising processor
                      instructions) to the memories of the P6022y VB through the Memory Management Unit.
                      Memory access is based on virtual addresses that are mapped to physical addresses.
                      The CPU always uses virtual addresses. The Memory Management Unit performs the
                      translation from virtual to physical addresses and the physical addresses are passed
                      from the Memory Management Unit to the memory interfaces to access the memories.
                      Access control is conducted in two ways:
                      • Memory partitioning: Each memory type ROM, RAM and EEPROM is partitioned into
                        two parts. In Boot Mode and Firmware Mode the CPU has access to the Firmware
                        EEPROM, Firmware RAM and Test-ROM. In System Mode and User Mode the CPU
                        has access to the Application EEPROM, Application RAM and Application ROM.
                        Access to both parts of each type is allowed in Test Mode for testing.
                      • Memory segmentation in User Mode: The three accessible parts of the memory in
                        ROM, RAM and EEPROM can be segmented into smaller memory areas. Access
                        rights (read/write or execute) can be defined for these segments. The operation read
                        and write are considered as one kind of operation, if one is allowed, so is the other.
                        However, in general the access to a segment can be denied.
                        In addition, access rights to Special Function Registers related to hardware
                        components can be defined for code executed in User Mode.
                      Memory partitioning is fixed and cannot be changed. It is determined during
                      production of the P6022y VB and is solely dependent on the major configuration (see
                      Section 1.4.2.1.1) and Post Delivery Configuration (see Section 1.4.2.3.1).
                      Memory segmentation can be defined in System Mode. The segmentation is active when
                      the CPU switches to User Mode. The segments, their access rights and the access
                      rights to Special Function Registers related to hardware components are defined in the
                      MMU Segment Table. The MMU Segment Table stores five values for each segment:
                      The memory access rights, the virtual start address of the segment, the virtual end
                      address of the segment, the address offset for the segment and the access rights to
                      Special Function Registers for code that is executed in the segment. The address offset
                      is used to relocate the segment anywhere in the memory map. The resulting address
                      computed by the Memory Management Unit can not overrule memory partitioning. Up

                      to 64 segments can be defined in the MMU Segment Table. Special configurations of
                      the memory access rights allow to specify less than 64 segments and to split the MMU
                      Segment Table into several parts being stored at different locations in memory.
                      Note that the MMU Segment Table itself is stored in the memory and therefore the table
                      itself can be placed in a segment accessible in User Mode.
                      In addition, SF.MEM_ACC permanently checks whether accessed addresses point to
                      physically implemented memory. Any access outside the boundaries of the physical
                      implemented memory in all CPU modes except the Test Mode and access to forbidden
                      memory addresses in User Mode are notified by raising an exception.
                      The Memory Management Unit also handles access rights to Special Function Registers
                      related to hardware components for code running in Firmware Mode. The configuration
                      of the access rights for User Mode and Firmware Mode are used by SF.SFR_ACC to
                      grant or block access to the related Special Function Registers. The access rights can
                      be defined for up to 16 groups of Special Function Registers, which are related to 16
                      hardware peripherals or memories described in [9], section 12.4. Thus, User Mode
                      and Firmware Mode can be restricted in their access to the Special Function Registers
                      related to hardware components on demand of the Security IC Embedded Software.
                      Note that SF.MEM_ACC only provides the access rights to SF.SFR_ACC, the access
                      control is enforced by SF.SFR_ACC.
                      SF.SFR_ACC: Special Function Register Access Control
                      SF.SFR_ACC controls access to the Special Function Registers and CPU mode
                      switches based on specific Special Function Register. SF.SFR_ACC implements access
                      control to the Special Function Registers as specified in the Access Control Policy and
                      the Security Functional Requirements FDP_ACC.1[SFR] and FDP_ACF.1[SFR].
                      The function of the Special Function Register and the CPU mode determine, whether
                      read and/or write access to a Special Function Register is allowed or not. Key registers
                      cannot be read since they are write-only to support the confidentiality of keys. Write
                      access is granted depending on the CPU mode. Similar for the output register of the
                      Random Number Generator, which is read-only based on its function, and read access is
                      granted based on the CPU mode.
                      SF.SFR_ACC controls accesses to Special Function Registers. If the access is not
                      allowed or the Special Function Register addressed by the code is not implemented an
                      exception is triggered. The Security IC Embedded Software can react on this exception.
                      Some Special Function Registers are implemented threefold, one for User Mode, a
                      second one for System Mode and a third one for Super System Mode meaning Boot
                      Mode, Test Mode and Firmware Mode. Hence, such Special Function Registers are
                      inherently separated and enforce the separation between the CPU modes.
                      SF.SFR_ACC relies on access rights to Special Function Registers related to hardware
                      components, which are provided by SF.MEM_ACC. Access rights to all other Special
                      Function Registers are pre-defined and cannot be configured by the code running on the
                      hardware platform.
                      This implies that code running in User Mode or Firmware Mode is not able to use
                      SS.RNG, SS.TDES, and SS.AES until access to the respective group of Special Function
                      Registers is explicitly granted by code running in System Mode. This holds for all 16

1.3 TOE Overview
The Security Target (ST) defines the security objectives and requirements for a
contact or contactless based chip of machine readable travel documents (MRTD)
based on the requirements and recommendations of the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO), EU requirements for biometric European passport
(Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 and Commission Implementing Decision
6181) and Biometric European Resident Permit (REGULATION (EU) 2017/1954
and Commission Implementing Decision 6178). This product is intended to
enable verification of the authenticity of the travel document and to identify its
holder during a border control, using an inspection system. The verification
process is based on Extended Access Control with Password Authenticated
Connection Establishment (PACE) and optionally Active Authentication (AA).

The main features and their origin are the following:
 Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
   according to ICAO Technical Report “Supplemental Access Control” [ICAO-
   9303] part 11 and strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0068-V2 [PACE-PP] for
   protection of the communication between terminal and chip. The following
   PACE mapping modes are supported and covered by the TOE:
      o    Generic Mapping (PACE-GM)
      o    Integrated Mapping (PACE-IM)
      o    Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM), which combines PACE-GM
           with Chip Authentication into a single protocol.

    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    travel document’s chip to the inspection system.
   Terminal Authentication v1
    according to BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1], [TR-03110-3] and
    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    inspection system to travel document’s chip and protects the confidentiality
    and integrity of the sensitive biometric reference data during their
    transmission from the TOE to the inspection system.

As a feature that can be optionally configured the TOE supports:
   Active Authentication
    which according to [ICAO-9303] prevents copying the SOD and proves that it
    has been read from the authentic chip. It proves that the chip has not been
    substituted.


   Polymorphic Authentication
    which according to [PCA-eMRTD] provides additional privacy by randomisation
    of returned Polymorphic Identities, Polymorphic Pseudonyms and
    Complementary Polymorphic ID attributes in combination with standard ICAO
    and EAC1 eMRTD protocols specified in ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] and BSI
    TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1] and [TR 03110-3].

The TOE may also be used as an ISO driving license, compliant to ISO/IEC 18013
or ISO/IEC TR 19446 supporting PACE, AA and CA, as both applications (MRTD
and IDL) share the same protocols and data structure organization. Therefore, in
the rest of the document, the word “MRTD” MAY be understood either as a MRTD
in the sense of ICAO, or a driving license compliant to ISO/IEC 18013 or ISO/IEC
TR 19446 depending on the targeted usage envisioned by the issuer.

Application note
This TOE claims an assurance level EAL5 augmented with AVA_VAN.5 and
ALC_DVS.2. AVA_VAN.5 implies that the TOE is resistant to attacks performed by
an attacker possessing "High attack potential".
Not all key sizes specified in this security target have sufficient cryptographic
strength for satisfying the AVA_VAN.5 “high attack potential”. In order to be
protected against attackers with a "high attack potential", sufficiently large
cryptographic key sizes SHALL be configured for this TOE. References can be
found in national and international document standards. Further details have
been specified in the TOE’s guidance documentation [AGD_PRE].

[TR-03110] have also been refered to in ISO18013 for EU driving licences. The
BAP-1 protocol defined in ISO18013 is equal to Basic Access Protocol (BAC)
defined in [ICAO-9303]. As to the logical data structure, the ISO18013 uses the
same concept of Passive Authentication defined in [ICAO-9303], but specifies
different ISO7816-4 elementary file identifiers for storing the ICAO defined
content of DG3, DG4 and DG15.

When an Issuing state is using the product as an ISO compliant Driving licence,
the following name mapping of roles, definitions, data groups and protocol is

Polymorphic eMRTD.


1.4.2.1 ICAO/EAC eMRTD and ISO Driving licence
This sub section explains the TOE security features for operational use of TOE
configured as ICAO/EAC eMRTD or as Driving Licence.

A State or Organisation issues travel documents to be used by the holder for
international travel. The traveller presents a travel document to the inspection
system to prove his or her identity. The travel document in context of this
Security Target contains:
  I.  visual (eye readable) biographical data and portrait of the holder,
 II.  a separate data summary (MRZ data) for visual and machine reading using
       OCR methods in the Machine readable zone (MRZ) and
III.  data elements on the travel document’s chip according to LDS in case of
       contactless machine reading.

The authentication of the traveller is based on:
  I.  the possession of a valid travel document personalized for a holder with
      the claimed identity as given on the biographical data page and
 II.  biometrics using the reference data stored in the travel document.

The issuing State or Organization ensures the authenticity of the data of genuine
travel documents. The receiving State trusts a genuine travel document of an
issuing State or Organization.

For this Security Target the travel document is viewed as unit of:
(i) the physical part of the travel document in form of paper and/or plastic
    and chip. It presents visual readable data including (but not limited to)
    personal data of the travel document holder
    (a) the biographical data on the biographical data page of the travel
         document surface,
    (b) the printed data in the Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) and
    (c) the printed portrait.

(ii) the logical travel document as data of the travel document holder stored
     according to the Logical Data Structure as defined in [ICAO-9303] as specified
     by ICAO on the contact based or contactless integrated circuit. It presents
     contact based / contactless readable data including(but not limited to)
     personal data of the travel document holder
     (a) the digital Machine Readable Zone Data (digital MRZ data, EF.DG1),
     (b) the digitized portraits (EF.DG2),
     (c) the biometric reference data of finger(s) (EF.DG3) or iris image(s)
          (EF.DG4) or both1,
     (d) the other data according to LDS (EF.DG5 to EF.DG16) and
     (e) the Document Security Object (SOD).


The issuing State or Organisation implements security features of the travel
document to maintain the authenticity and integrity of the travel document and
their data. The physical part of the travel document and the travel document’s
chip are identified by the Document Number.

The physical part of the travel document is protected by physical security
measures (e.g. watermark, security printing), logical (e.g. authentication keys of
the travel document’s chip) and organisational security measures (e.g. control of
materials, personalisation procedures) [ICAO-9303].These security measures can
include the binding of the travel document’s chip to the travel document.

The logical travel document is protected in authenticity and integrity by a digital
signature created by the document signer acting for the issuing State or
Organisation and the security features of the travel document’s chip.

The ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] defines the baseline security methods Passive
Authentication, advanced security access methods Basic Access Control (BAC)
and Password Authenticated Connection Establishment to the logical travel



These biometric reference data are optional according to [ICAO-9303]. This ST assumes that the issuing State or
1

Organisation uses this option and protects these data by means of extended access control.

document, Active Authentication of the travel document’s chip, Extended Access
Control and the Data Encryption of sensitive biometrics as optional security
measure. The Passive Authentication Mechanism is performed completely and
independently of the TOE by the TOE environment.

The BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1] and [TR 03110-3] specify the
Extended Access Control protocols Chip Authentication version 1 (CAv1) and
Terminal Authentication (TAv1), which are required to get secured access to the
biometric data stored in data groups DG3 and DG4 in combination with PACE or
BAC.

This Security Target addresses the protection of the logical travel document:
   (i) in integrity by write-only-once access control and by physical means, and
   (ii) in confidentiality by the Extended Access Control Mechanism.

This Security Target addresses the Chip Authentication Version 1 described in
[TR-03110-1] and PACE-CAM described in [ICAO-9303] part 11 as an alternative
to the Active Authentication stated in [ICAO-9303].

For Basic Access Control (BAC) supported by the product, a separate evaluation
and certification is performed with ST [ST-BAC].

The confidentiality by Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
is a mandatory security feature of the TOE. The travel document shall strictly
conform to the ‘Common Criteria Protection Profile Machine Readable Travel
Document using Standard Inspection Procedure with PACE [PACE-PP]. Note that
[PACE-PP] considers high attack potential.

For the PACE protocol according to [ICAO-9303] part 11, the following steps shall
be performed:
 (i) the travel document's chip encrypts a nonce with the shared password,
       derived from the MRZ resp. CAN data and transmits the encrypted nonce
       together with the domain parameters to the terminal.
 (ii) The terminal recovers the nonce using the shared password, by
       (physically) reading the MRZ or CAN data. This nonce shall be converted to
       a group generator using one of the following mapping algorithms, which
       maps a static generator to an ephemeral generator:
           a. Generic mapping (PACE-GM) or
           b. Integrated mapping PACE-IM)
 (iii) The travel document's chip and terminal computer perform a Diffie-
       Hellmann key agreement together with the ephemeral domain parameters
       to create a shared secret. Both parties derive the session keys KMAC and
       KENC from the shared secret.
 (iv) Each party generates an authentication token, sends it to the other party
       and verifies the received token.

In case of PACE with Chip Authenticated Mapping (PACE-CAM), in addition to the
steps above executed for the PACE-GM variant, the MRTD chip computes Chip
Authentication Data CAIC, encrypts them AIC = E(KSEnc, CAIC) and sends them

to the terminal. The terminal decrypts AIC and verifies the authenticity of the
chip using the recovered Chip Authentication Data CAIC.

After successful key negotiation, the terminal and the travel document's chip
provide private communication (secure messaging) [TR-03110-1], [ICAO-9303].

This Security Target requires the TOE to implement the Extended Access Control
as defined in [TR-03110-1]. The Extended Access Control consists of two parts:
  (i) the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1 and
  (ii) the Terminal Authentication Protocol Version 1 (v.1).

The Chip Authentication Protocol v.1
  (i) authenticates the travel document’s chip to the inspection system and
  (ii) establishes secure messaging which is used by Terminal Authentication v.1
       to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the sensitive biometric
       reference data during their transmission from the TOE to the inspection
       system. Therefore Terminal Authentication v.1 can only be performed if
       Chip Authentication v.1has been successfully executed.

The Terminal Authentication Protocolv.1 consists of
  (i) the authentication of the inspection system as entity authorized by the
       receiving State or Organisation through the issuing State, and
  (ii) an access control by the TOE to allow reading the sensitive biometric
       reference data only to successfully authenticated authorized inspection
       systems.

The Active Authentication protocol may be optionally configured during
personalisation.

The issuing State or Organisation authorizes the receiving State by means of
certification the authentication public keys of Document Verifiers who create
Inspection System Certificates.


1.4.2.2 Polymorphic eMRTD

In addition to an ICAO/EAC eMRTD functionality, the TOE supports Polymorphic
eMRTD extensions that can be configured using the same applet during
personalisation. The TOE’s Polymorphic eMRTD extensions enable secure
authentication with enhanced privacy protection features. The Polymorphic
extensions provide the holder the possibility to authenticate towards a service
provider using an authentication service in a non-traceable and non-linkable
manner thanks to usage of Polymorphic ID attributes.

The Polymorphic extensions are used to configure a Polymorphic eMRTD as stand
alone application instance or next to an ICAO/EAC eMRTD/Driving application
licence instance having its own application identifier during personalisation.

                        eMRTD Configuration)

The Polymorphic eMRTD uses the same ICAO and EAC1 protocols like PACEv2,
Chip Authentication v1 (CAv1) and Terminal Authentication (v1) as defined in
[ICAO-9303], [TR-03110-1] and [TR-03110-3]. The TOE’s Polymorphic eMRTD
extensions provide the following features:

      Secure storage of the Polymorphic ID attributes during personalisation or
       the TOE.
      Polymorphic Authentication Protocol (PMA) for authenticated access with
       user consent, randomization and secure readout of the Polymorphic ID
       attributes, in combination with PACEv2 and EAC1 eMRTD protocols.
      PACEv2 protocol extended with PIN and PUK passwords, to enforce user
       authentication (document holder verification) in compliance with [TR-
       03101-3].

For Polymorphic eMRTD, the PACE protocol is configured with PIN, PUK and CAN
passwords in compliance with [TR-03110-3] during personalisation. Only PACE-
GM and PACE-IM are configurable for a Polymorphic eMRTD.

The Active Authentication protocol shall not be configured for a polymorphic
eMRTD.

The logical data structure consists only of EF.CVCA, DG14 and EF.SOD. In order
to assure a sufficient level of privacy during authentication the CAv1 private key
and EF.SOD are shared amoung a sufficient high number of personalised
Polymorphic eMRTDs, i.e. the logical data structure does not contain any unique
identifiable data.



1.4.3 TOE life cycle
The TOE life cycle is described in terms of its four life cycle phases. (With respect
to the [SIC-PP], the TOE life-cycle is additionally subdivided into 7 steps in the
ST. These steps are denoted too in the following although the sequence of the
steps differs for the TOE life cycle).

1.4.3.1 Phase 1 “Development”
(Step1) The TOE is developed in phase 1. The IC developer develops the
integrated circuit, the IC Dedicated Software and the guidance documentation
associated with these TOE components.
The IC developer also acts as the developer of the embedded software (operating
system), which is the NXP JCOP 3 P60.

(Step2) The software developer uses the guidance documentation for the
integrated circuit and the guidance documentation for relevant parts of the NXP
JCOP 3 P60 and develops the ePassport application and the guidance
documentation associated with this TOE component.

The ePassport application (i.e. the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
(SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet run time code) may be
integrated either in ROM or in EEPROM of the chip. Depending on the intention:
      (a) the ePassport application is securely delivered directly from the
          software developer (IDEMIA development dept.) to the IC manufacturer
          (NXP). The applet code will be integrated into the ROM mask code or
          inEEPROM by the IC manufacturer, or
      (b) the ePassport application is securely delivered directly from the
          software developer (IDEMIA development dept.) to the travel document
          manufacturer (IDEMIA production dept.) .) for loading in EEPROM.

Notice that the guidance documentation of the ePassport application is always
securely delivered directly from the software developer (IDEMIA development
dept.) to the travel document manufacturer (IDEMIA production dept.).


1.4.3.2 Phase 2 “Manufacturing”
(Step3) In a first step the TOE integrated circuit is produced containing the travel
document’s chip Dedicated Software, the parts of the travel document’s chip
Embedded Software and in case of alternative a) the ePassport application in
ROM or in EEPROM.

The IC manufacturer writes the IC Identification Data onto the chip to control the
IC as travel document material during the IC manufacturing and the delivery
process to the travel document manufacturer. The IC is securely delivered from
the IC manufacturer to the travel document manufacturer.

                           eMRTD Configuration)

If necessary the IC manufacturer adds the parts of the IC Embedded Software in
the non-volatile programmable memories (for instance EEPROM).

(Step4 optional) The travel document manufacturer combines the IC with
hardware for the contact based / contactless interface in the travel document
unless the travel document consist of the chip only.

(Step5) The travel document manufacturer
  i.  adds the IC Embedded Software or part of it in the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM) if necessary and in case
      of alternative (b), loads the ePassport application into the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM),
 ii.      creates the ePassport application and
iii.      equips travel document’s chips with pre-personalization Data.

EAC PP Application Note 1: Creation of the application for this TOE implies
Applet instantiation.

For this Security Target the following name mappings to the protection profile
[EAC-PP-V2] apply:
    IC Dedicated SW = Low level IC libraries
    travel document’s chip Embedded Software = NXP JCOP 3 P60 operating
       system.
    ePassport application = IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
       (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet run time code or an
       instantiation of it.
    Pre-personalization Data = Personalization Agent Key Set, Card Production
       Life Cycle (CPLC) data and buffer settings.

Both the underlying platform and IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
(SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet provide configuration and
life-cycle management functions required for TOE preparation. TOE preparation
steps are performed in manufacturing phase and consist of the following 2
activities:
    1. Platform initialisation
       2. Pre-personalisation

Platform initialisation
Platform initialisation consists of the configuration of the NXP JCOP 3 P60 in
accordance with requirements specified in the platform administrator guidance
[PLTF-PRE] by using the dedicated platform commands. Furthermore the Pre-
Personalisation Agent key set is installed and (a part of) the CPLC data is
updated. To prevent unattended tracing of the MRTD document, the NXP JCOP 3
P60 is configured such that unauthenticated access to any platform unique
idenfiable data is not possible.

                              eMRTD Configuration)

Pre-personalisation
The pre-personalisation consists of the following steps:
   a. IC (chip) Authentication and getting chip access with the pre-
      personalisation key set.
   b. [optional] In case the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
      (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet runtime code does
      not reside in ROM, it is loaded into EEPROM.
   c. Install the applet application instances depending on the desired TOE
      configuration specified in section 1.4.2, using IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with
      Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet.
   d. Set the ePassport (and if present) the Polymorphic eMRTD applet
      irreversibly in its PERSONALISATION life-cycle state by installation of the
      Personalisation Agent specific personalisation key set(s).

During step (c) the CPLC data with the IC Identifier as well as the other pre-
personalisation data is configured in the TOE. The last step (d) finalizes the TOE.
This is the moment the TOE starts to exist and is ready for delivery to the
Personalisation Agent. The guidance documentation for the Personalisation Agent
is [AGD_PRE].

The pre-personalised travel document together with the IC Identifier is securely
delivered from the travel document manufacturer to the Personalisation Agent.
The travel document manufacturer also provides the relevant parts of the
guidance documentation [AGD_PRE] and [AGD_OPE] and the Personalisation
Agent Key set to the Personalisation Agent. The following table describes the
physical delivery of the TOE components:

1.4.3.3 Phase 3 “Personalisation of the travel document”
(Step 6) The personalisation of the travel document includes
  i.  the survey of the MRTD holder’s biographical data,
 ii.   the enrolment of the MRTD holder biometric reference data (i.e. the
       digitized portraits and the optional biometric reference data),
iii.   the printing of the visual readable data onto the physical MRTD,
iv.    the writing of the TOE User Data and TSF Data into the logical MRTD and
 v.    configuration of the TSF if necessary.

The step (iv) is performed by the Personalisation Agent and includes but is not
limited to the creation of:
  i.   the digital MRZ data (EF.DG1),
 ii.   the digitized portrait (EF.DG2), and
iii.   the Document security object.

The signing of the Document security object by the Document signer [ICAO-
9303] finalizes the personalisation of the genuine travel document for the travel
document holder. The personalised travel document (together with appropriate
guidance (AGD_OPE) for TOE usage if necessary) is handed over to the travel
document holder for operational use.

The personalisation of Polymorphic eMRTD application instance includes:

 i.    establishing the identity of the polymorphic eMRTD document holder,
 ii.   Requesting the required Polymorphic eMRTD ID attributes from the central
       Key Management authority,
iii.   writing Polymorphic ID attributes, Polymorphic LDS data as defined in
       [PCA-eMRTD],
iv.    writing the TSF data (PIN, PUK, CAv1 private key) as defined in [PCA-
       eMRTD],
 v.    signing the Document Security Object defined in
       [ICAO-9303] (in the role of DS).


The signing of the Document security object by the Document signer [ICAO-
9303] finalizes the personalisation of the genuine Polymorphic eMRTD document
for the travel document holder. The personalised Polymorphic eMRTD document
(together with appropriate guidance (AGD_OPE) for TOE usage if necessary) is
handed over to the Polymorphic eMRTD document holder for operational use.

Private Key.

EAC PP Application note 3: This ST distinguishes between the Personalisation
Agent as entity known to the TOE and the Document Signer as entity in the TOE
IT environment signing the Document security object as described in [ICAO-
9303]. This approach allows but does not enforce the separation of these roles.


1.4.3.4 Phase 4 “Operational Use”
(Step 7) The TOE is used as a travel document's chip by the traveller and the
inspection systems in the “Operational Use” phase. The user data can be read
according to the security policy of the issuing State or Organisation and can be
used according to the security policy of the issuing State but they can never be
modified.

EAC PP Application note 42: The intention of the ST is to consider at least the
phases 1 and parts of phase 2 (i.e. Step1 to Step3) as part of the evaluation and
therefore to define the TOE delivery according to CC after this phase. Since
specific production steps of phase 2 are of minor security relevance (e.g. booklet
manufacturing and antenna integration) these are not part of the CC evaluation
under ALC. Nevertheless the decision about this has to be taken by the
certification body resp. the national body of the issuing State or Organisation. In
this case the national body of the issuing State or Organisation is responsible for
these specific production steps.
Note that the personalisation process and its environment may depend on
specific security needs of an issuing State or Organisation. All production,
generation and installation procedures after TOE delivery up to the “Operational
Use” (phase 4) have to be considered in the product evaluation process under
AGD assurance class. Therefore, the Security Target outlines the split up of
P.Manufact, P.Personalisation and the related security objectives into aspects
relevant before vs. after TOE delivery.


1.4.3.5 Non-TOE hardware/software/firmware required by the TOE
There is no explicit non-TOE hardware, software or firmware required by the TOE
to perform its claimed security features. The TOE is defined to comprise the chip
and the complete operating system and application. Note, the inlay holding the
chip as well as the antenna and the booklet (holding the printed MRZ) are
needed to represent a complete travel document. Nevertheless, these parts are
not inevitable for the secure operation of the TOE.




2
 For this ST all steps of both phase 1 and phase 2 are part of the evaluation and therefore define the TOE
delivery according to the CC evaluation after this phase.

2.3 Package Claim
This ST is conforming to assurance package EAL5 augmented with ALC_DVS.2
and AVA_VAN.5 defined in CC part 3 [CC-3].


2.4 PP Conformance Rationale
This ST claims strict conformance to [EAC-PP-V2]. According to hints in [EAC-PP-
V2] parts of the [PACE-PP] have been included into this ST. A detailed
justification is given in the following.


2.4.1 Main aspects
-   The TOE description (chapter 1.3) is based on the TOE definition and TOE
    usage of [EAC-PP, 1.1]. It was enhanced by product specific details.

-   All definitions of the security problem definition in [EAC-PP, 3] have been
    taken exactly from the protection profile in the same wording.

-   All security objectives have been taken exactly from [EAC-PP, 4] in the same
    wording, except for OT.Chip_Auth_Proof which is enhanced to support
    Active Authentication.

-   The part of extended components definition has been taken originally from
    [EAC-PP, 5].

-   All SFRs for the TOE have been taken originally from the [EAC-PP, 6.1] added
    by according iterations, selections and assignments.

-   The security assurance requirements (SARs) have been taken originally from
    the EAC-PP. The requirements are shifted to those of EAL 5+.


2.4.2 Overview of differences between the PP and the ST

The Active Authentication has been added to the TOE. For that:
- One assumption has been added to cover Active Authentication during
   personalization: A.Pers_Agent_AA
- Two security objectives for the environment have been added:
   OE.Auth_Key_MRTD and OE.AA_MRTD. These additions to the original
   objectives of the PP do not contradict with any other objective nor mitigate a
   threat (or part of a threat) meant to be addressed by security objectives for
   the TOE in the PP.
- Three security functional requirements have been added:
              FCS_COP.1/SIG_GEN
                FIA_API.1/AA
                FMT_MTD.1/AAPK

                                                                2018_2000036361

                        eMRTD Configuration)

The additional functionality of Password Authenticated Connection Establishment
with Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM) has been added to the TOE. It
possesses the same security requirements as the PACE functionality, which
means that the same security problem definition is applicable for PACE-CAM.


The following additional SFRs have been defined for PACE-CAM:
              FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM
                FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM
                FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM
                FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM
                FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM
                FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ
                FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_WRITE




The additional functionality of the Polymorphic eMRTD extensions has been
added to the TOE with: (i) additional security problem definition; (ii) additional
security objectives; (iii) additional SFRs. Notice that many SFRs are included
from the [EACv2-PP].

                           eneral support for cryptographic operations needed.

OT.Data_Authenticity The security objective OT.Data_Authenticity aims
  ensuring authenticity of the User- and TSF data (after the PACE
  Authentication) by enabling its verification at the terminal-side and by an
  active verification by the TOE itself. This objective is mainly achieved by
  FTP_ITC.1/PACE using FCS_COP.1/PACE_MAC. A prerequisite for establishing
  this trusted channel is a successful PACE or Chip and Terminal Authentication
  v.1       FIA_UID.1/PACE,       FIA_UAU.1/PACE        (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM,
  FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) using FCS_CKM.1/DH_PACE resp.
  FCS_CKM.1/CA and possessing the special properties FIA_UAU.5/PACE,
  FIA_UAU.6/PACE (FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM, FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM for PACE
  CAM) resp. FIA_UAU.6/EAC. FDP_RIP.1 requires erasing the values of session
  keys (here: for KMAC). FIA_UAU.4/PACE, FIA_UAU.5/PACE and FCS_CKM.4
  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM, FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM and FCS_CKM.4 for PACE
  CAM) represent some required specific properties of the protocols used. The
  SFR FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords, the
  Chip Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication Private Key. The
  SFR FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE
  passwords and the modular invert of the CA key. FMT_MTD.1/PA requires that
  SOD containing signature over the User Data stored on the TOE and used for
  the Passive Authentication is allowed to be written by the Personalisation
  Agent only and, hence, is to be considered as trustworthy. The SFR
  FCS_RND.1 represents a general support for cryptographic operations needed.
  The SFRs FMT_SMF.1 and FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles
  related.

OT.Data_Confidentiality The security objective OT.Data_Confidentiality aims
  that the TOE always ensures confidentiality of the User- and TSF-data stored
  and, after the PACE Authentication resp. Chip Authentication, of these data
  exchanged. This objective for the data stored is mainly achieved by
                        Security Target Lite
                                                                   Ref.:

  (FDP_ACC.1/TRM, FDP_ACF.1/TRM). FIA_UAU.4/PACE, FIA_UAU.5/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM,        FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM      for   PACE    CAM)    and
  FCS_CKM.4 represent some required specific properties of the protocols used.
  This objective for the data exchanged is mainly achieved by FDP_UCT.1/TRM,
  FDP_UIT.1/TRM and FTP_ITC.1/PACE using FCS_COP.1/PACE_ENC resp.
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC. A prerequisite for establishing this trusted channel is a
  successful PACE or Chip and Terminal Authentication v.1 FIA_UID.1/PACE,
  FIA_UAU.1/PACE (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM, FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE
  CAM) using FCS_CKM.1/DH_PACE resp. FCS_CKM.1/CA and possessing the
  special properties FIA_UAU.5/PACE, FIA_UAU.6/PACE (FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM,
  FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) resp. FIA_UAU.6/EAC. FDP_RIP.1
  requires erasing the values of session keys (here: for Kenc). The SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords, the Chip
  Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication Private Key. The SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords
  and the modular invert of the CA key. FMT_MTD.1/PA requires that SOD
  containing signature over the User Data stored on the TOE and used for the
  Passive Authentication is allowed to be written by the Personalisation Agent
  only and, hence, is to be considered trustworthy. The SFR FCS_RND.1
  represents the general support for cryptographic operations needed. The SFRs
  FMT_SMF.1 and FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related.

OT.Tracing The security objective OT.Tracing aims that the TOE prevents
  gathering TOE tracing data by means of unambiguous identifying the travel
  document remotely through establishing or listening to a communication via
  the contactless/contact-based interface of the TOE without a priori knowledge
  of the correct values of shared passwords (CAN, MRZ, PIN, PUK). This
  objective is achieved as follows:
            1. While establishing PACE communication with CAN, MRZ or PUK
                (non-blocking      authentication /   authorization  data)   by
                FIA_AFL.1/PACE,
            2. while establishing PACE communication using the PIN (blocking
                authentication data) by FIA_AFL.1/Block_PIN,
            3. for listening to PACE communication and for establishing CAv1
                communication by FTP_ITC.1/PACE,
            4. and      for     listening     to  CAv1     communication     by
                FTP_ITC.1/Polymorphic. The trusted channel shall be established
                by performing the PACE, CAv1 and TAv1 protocols according to
                [TR03110TR-03110] and the Polymorphic Authentication protocol
                (PMA).

OT.Prot_Abuse-Func The security objective OT.Prot_Abuse-Func “Protection
  against Abuse of Functionality” is ensured by the SFRs FMT_LIM.1, FMT_LIM.2,
  FMT_LIM.1/POLY and FMT_LIM.2/POLY which prevent misuse of test
  functionality of the TOE or other features which may not be used after TOE
  Delivery.

OT.Prot_Inf_Leak The security objective OT.Prot_Inf_Leak “Protection against
  Information Leakage” requires the TOE to protect confidential TSF data stored
  and/or processed in the travel document’s chip against disclosure
      by measurement and analysis of the shape and amplitude of signals or the
        time between events found by measuring signals on the electromagnetic
        field, power consumption, clock, or I/O lines which is addressed by the
        SFR FPT_EMS.1,
      by forcing a malfunction of the TOE which is addressed by the SFR
        FPT_FLS.1 and FPT_TST.1, and/or
      by a physical manipulation of the TOE which is addressed by the SFR
        FPT_PHP.3.

OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper The security objective OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper “Protection
  against Physical Tampering” is covered by the SFR FPT_PHP.3.

OT.Prot_Malfunction The security objective OT.Prot_Malfunction “Protection
  against Malfunctions” is covered by (i) the SFR FPT_TST.1 which requires self-
  tests to demonstrate the correct operation and tests of authorized users to
  verify the integrity of TSF data and TSF code, and (ii) the SFRFPT_FLS.1 which
  requires a secure state in case of detected failure or operating conditions
  possibly causing a malfunction.

OT.Identification The security objective OT.Identification “Identification of the
  TOE” addresses the storage of Initialisation and Pre-Personalisation Data in its
  non-volatile memory, whereby they also include the IC Identification Data
  uniquely identifying the TOE’s chip. This will be ensured by TSF according to
  SFR FAU_SAS.1. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA allows only the Manufacturer
  to write Initialisation and Pre-personalisation Data (including the
  Personalisation Agent key set). The SFR FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS requires the
  Personalisation Agent to disable access to Initialisation and Pre-personalisation
  Data in the life cycle phase ‘operational use’. The SFRs FMT_SMF.1 and
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related.

OT.AC_Pers The       security   objective  OT.AC_Pers      “Access   Control   for
  Personalisation of logical travel document” addresses the access control of the
  writing the logical travel document. The justification for the SFRs FAU_SAS.1,
  FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA and FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS arises from the justification for
  OT.Identification above with respect to the Pre-personalisation Data. The write
  access to the logical travel document data are defined by the SFR
  FIA_UID.1/PACE (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM), FIA_UAU.1/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM), FDP_ACC.1/TRM and FDP_ACF.1/TRM
  in the same way: only the successfully authenticated Personalisation Agent is
  allowed to write the data of the groups EF.DG1 to EF.DG16 of the logical travel
  document only once. FMT_MTD.1/PA covers the related property of
  OT.AC_Pers (writing SOD and, in generally, personalization data). The SFR
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE lists the roles (including Personalisation Agent) and the SFR
  FMT_SMF.1 lists the TSF management functions (including Personalisation).

  The SFRs FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ (FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ for
  PACE CAM protocol) and FPT_EMS.1 restrict the access to the Personalisation
  Agent Keys, the Chip Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication
  Private key. The authentication of the terminal as Personalisation Agent shall
  be performed by TSF according to SFRs FIA_UAU.4/PACE and FIA_UAU.5/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM and FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). If the
  Personalisation Terminal wants to authenticate itself to the TOE by means of
  the Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 (after Chip Authentication v.1) with
  the Personalisation Agent Keys, the TOE will use TSF according to the
  FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the challenge), FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the
  derivation of the new session keys after Chip Authentication v.1), and
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC (for the ENC_MAC_Mode secure
  messaging), FCS_COP.1/SIG_VER (as part of the Terminal Authentication
  Protocol v.1) and FIA_UAU.6/EAC (for the re-authentication). If the
  Personalisation Terminal wants to authenticate itself to the TOE by means of
  the Authentication Mechanism with the Personalisation Agent Key, the TOE will
  use TSF according to the FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the challenge) and
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC (to verify the authentication attempt). The session keys
  are destroyed according to FCS_CKM.4 after use.

OT.Sens_Data_Conf The            security     objective      OT.Sense_Data_Conf“
  Confidentiality of sensitive biometric reference data” is enforced by the Access
  Control SFP defined in FDP_ACC.1/TRM and FDP_ACF.1/TRM allowing the data
  of EF.DG3 and EF.DG4 only to be read by successfully authenticated Extended
  Inspection System being authorized by a valid certificate according
  FCS_COP.1/SIG_VER. The SFRs FIA_UID.1/PACE and FIA_UAU.1/PACE
  (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM and FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) require the
  identification and authentication of the inspection systems. The SFR
  FIA_UAU.5/PACE requires the successful Chip Authentication (CA) v.1 before
  any     authentication    attempt   as    Extended     Inspection  System    (or
  FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). During the protected communication
  following the CA v.1 the reuse of authentication data is prevented by
  FIA_UAU.4/PACE (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). The SFR
  FIA_UAU.6/EAC and FDP_UCT.1/TRM requires the confidentiality protection of
  the transmitted data after Chip Authentication v.1 by means of secure
  messaging implemented by the cryptographic functions according to
  FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the terminal authentication challenge),
  FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the generation of shared secret and for the derivation of
  the new session keys), and FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC for
  the ENC_MAC_Mode secure messaging. The session keys are destroyed
  according to FCS_CKM.4 after use. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/CAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ requires that the Chip Authentication Key cannot be
  written unauthorized or read afterwards. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/AAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ requires that the Active Authentication Key cannot be
  written       unauthorized       or      read      afterwards.      The     SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_WRITE and FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ
  requires that the modular invert of the CA key cannot be written unauthorized
  or read afterwards. To allow a verification of the certificate chain as in

OT.Chip_Auth_Proof The security objective OT.Chip_Auth_Proof “Proof of
  travel document’s chip authenticity” is ensured by the Chip Authentication
  Protocolv.1 provided by FIA_API.1/CA and by Active Authentication provided
  by FIA_API.1/AA proving the identity of the TOE. The Chip Authentication
  Protocolv.1 defined by FCS_CKM.1/CA is performed using a TOE internally
  stored confidential private key as required by FMT_MTD.1/CAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ. The Chip Authentication Protocolv.1 [TR-03110-1]
  requires additional TSF according to FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the derivation of the
  session keys), FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC (for the
  ENC_MAC_Mode        secure    messaging).    The   SFRs     FMT_SMF.1     and
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related. The Active
  Authentication defined by FCS_COP.1/SIG_GEN for the generation of the RSA
  Signature is performed using a TOE internally stored confidential private key
  as required by FMT_MTD.1/AAPK and FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ. According to
  FDP_ACF.1, only the successfully authenticated Inspection Systems are
  allowed to request active authentication (FDP_ACF.1.2, rule 2).

6.3.3.1.1 Rationale for the exclusion of Dependencies


The dependency FMT_MSA.3 of FDP_ACF.1/TRM is discarded. The access
  control TSF according to FDP_ACF.1/TRM uses security attributes which are
  defined during the personalisation and are fixed over the whole life time of the
  TOE. No management of these security attribute (i.e. SFR FMT_MSA.1 and
  FMT_MSA.3) is necessary here.

6.3.4 Rationale for the Security Assurance Requirements
The EAL5 was chosen to permits a developer to gain maximum assurance from
positive security engineering based upon rigorous commercial development
practices supported by moderate application of specialist security engineering
techniques. Such a TOE will probably be designed and developed with the intent
of achieving EAL5 assurance. It is likely that the additional costs attributable to
the EAL5 requirements, relative to rigorous development without the application
of specialised techniques, will not be large.

This section provides a description of the security functions and assurance
measures of the TOE that meet the TOE security requirements.

The TOE provides security features (SF) which can be associated to following
groups:
  Identification and Authentication mechanisms
  Cryptographic functions support
  Access control /Storage and protection of logical travel document data

will be externally available to the user by APDU commands according to the
access conditions specified by the according policies considering the life cycle
state, user role and security state.

7.1.1 SF.IA Identification and Authentication
The different authentication mechanisms are supported by APDU commands and
parameters using the cryptographic functions provided by the platform. The
authentication mechanisms are enforced by protocols and APDU methods as
specified in the functional specification.

Note that Symmetric Basic Access Control (BAC) Authentication Mechanism is
supported by the TOE but not covered by this Security Target.

The TOE supports the following authentication mechanisms:
        SF.IA.1: Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
        SF.IA.2: EAC Chip Authentication v. 1
        SF.IA.3: EAC Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1

                       eMRTD Configuration)

7.1.2 SF.CF Cryptographic functions support
Cryptographic function support is provided by the underlying NXP JCOP 3 P60,
i.e. the TOE relies on the underlying platform for performing its required
cryptographic operations.

SF.CF Cryptographic functions include:
        SF.CF.1: 3DES and AES cipher operations for secure messaging
        SF.CF.2: Digest calculations (SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and
         SHA-512)
        SF.CF.3: Signature generation (ECDSA, RSA)
        SF.CF.4: Signature verification (ECDSA, RSA)
        SF.CF.5: Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement (ECDH and DH)
        SF.CF.6: Key Generation (PACE ECDH/DH ephemeral keys and secure
         messaging MAC and ENC session keys)
        SF.CF.7: Key and secret authentication data Destruction
        SF.CF.8: True Random Number generation
        SF.CF.9: Randomization of PI/PP/CPI data as part of the Polymorphic
         Authentication protocol (PMA)




7.1.3 SF.ILTB Protection against interference, logical tampering
and bypass

SF.ILTB.1
  Protection against interference, logical tampering and bypass
  Security domains are supported by the Java Card platform used by the TOE
  underlying NXP JCOP 3 P60. The NXP JCOP 3 P60 provides protection against
  physical attack and performs self-tests as described in [PLTF-ST].
  The platform protects the TOE against malfunctions that are caused by
  exposure to operating conditions that may cause a malfunction. This includes
  hardware resets and operation outside the specified norms.
  The IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic
  eMRTD Configuration) Applet uses transient memory where a hardware reset
  always reverts the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
  (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet into an unauthenticated
  state.

7.1.4 SF.AC Access control / Storage and protection of logical
travel document data

SF.AC.1
  Access control / Storage and protection of logical travel document
  data
  The TOE provided access control, storage and protection of logical travel
  document data including access control to MRTD data. The TOE implements
  the subjects, objects, security attributes and rules according to the security
  attribute based access control. Access control is enforced by the APDU
  methods as specified in the interface defined in the functional specification.

7.1.5 SF.SM Secure Messaging

SF.SM.1
  Secure Messaging
  Secure messaging MAC and ENC operations are performed by the TOE’s
  platform.
  Secure messaging in ENC_MAC mode is established during PACE or re-
  established during Chip Authentication v1 and is based on SF.CF.1, 5, 6 and 8.

SF.SM.2
  Secure Messaging – Re-authentication
  The Retail MAC for 3DES and CMAC for AES are part of every APDU
  command/response when secure messaging is active after a successful PACE
  or Chip Authentication has been accomplished. Re-authentication after reset of
  the SM protocol is assured by accepting only valid (mandatory) MAC or CMAC
  cryptograms.

7.1.6 SF.LCM Security and life cycle management

SF.LCM.1
  Management of phases and roles
  For the TOE the following life-cycle phases have been identified:
      1. Manufacturing phase
      2. Personalisation phase
      3. Operational phase
      4. Termination phase
  Each life-cycle phase (or state) has its typical user acting as role holder.

                           Polymorphic eMRTD document holder
Terminated phase           None

  All role holders in Manufacturing, Pre-Personalisation and Personalisation
  phases are identified by cryptographic authentication keys. In Operational
  phase the PACE password is required to authenticate the Basic or Extended
  Inspection System in order to get access to the non-sensitive ICAO LDS
  datagroups.
  The IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic
  eMRTD Configuration) Applet maintains the internal life-cycle state the
  moment that the applet is installed. This state, together with the access
  control mechanisms force the Terminal into a specific role, for the pre-
  personalisation and subsequent, personalisation and operational phases. The
  phases (and corresponding life-cycle states) are controlled by APDU
  commands.



SF.LCM.2
  Life Cycle states of the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
  (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet
  The TOE supports the following life-cycle states:
      1. Not instantiated (applet resides in ROM or in EEPROM)
      2. PRE-PERSONALISATION state
      3. PERSONALISATION state
      4. OPERATIONAL state
      5. TERMINATED state (irreversibly)
  Each life-cycle phase (or state) has its typical user acting as role holder.

A.Polymorphic_Auth
  It assumed that:
      o All authentication infrastructure keys used by the central Key
          Management       Authority     for   the    polymorphic    authentication
          infrastructure (generation and transformation of PP, PI and CPI) are
          generated, handled and stored securely.
      o The PP/PI/CPI are generated securely by the central Key Management
          Authority of the polymorphic authentication infrastructure and stored
          securely in the eMRTD polymorphic chip during the personalization
          phase.
      o The TOE communicates only with Trustworthy Authentication
          Service/Terminal during the Polymorphic Authentication.
      o The randomised PP, PI and CPI are securely received by Polymorphic
          Authentication Service/Terminal. The randomised PP, PI and CPI are
          transformed (“re-keyed”) by the central Key Management Authority
          (i.e. ElGamal re-encryption of the randomized PP, PI and/or CPI using
          the public key of Service Provider, who has is authorized to read the
          plain value of identifying user attributes included in the PP, PI or CPI).
          Identification by the identifying user attributes contained inside the PP,
          PI and CPI takes place at the Service Provider.
  Application Note:
  This Assumption has been added to this ST for the polymorphic authentication
  infrastructure. This addition does not conflict with the strict conformance to
  PACE PP [PACE-PP] and EACv1 PP [EAC-PP-V2].

         infrastructure in order to limit the access to Polymorphic data of
         Polymorphic eMRTD document holders to authorized Organisations. The
         Country Verifying Certification Authority of the issuing State or
         Organisation generates card verifiable Document Verifier Certificates
         for the authorized Document Verifier only.
      o The issuing State or Organisation establishs the necessary public key
         infrastructure in order to (i) generate the Polymorphic eMRTD
         document's Chip Authentication Key Pair, (ii) sign and store the Chip
         Authentication Public Key in the Chip Authentication Public Key data
         and (iii) support Polymorphic Authentication Terminals/Services to
         verify the authenticity of the Polymorphic eMRTD document's chip
         according to [TR-03110] used for genuine Polymorphic eMRTD
         document by certification of the Chip Authentication Public Key by
         means of the Document Security Object.
      o The Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer establishes a public key
         infrastructure for the card verifiable certificates used for Terminal
         Authentication. For this aim, the Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer
         shall run a Country Verifying Certification Authority. The PKI shall fulfill
         the requirements and rules of the corresponding certificate policy. The
         Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer shall make the CVCA certificate
         available to the personalization agent or the manufacturer.
      o The polymorphic eMRTD document Issuer issues the polymorphic
         eMRTD document and approves it using the terminals and
         authentication services complying with all applicable laws and
         regulations.
  Application Note:
  This Assumption is an extension of the Assumption 'A.Auth_PKI' defined in
  [EAC-PP-V2]. For the EAC functionality of the TOE the assumption is necessary
  because it covers the pre-requisite for performing the Terminal Authentication
  Protocol Version 1.

A.Insp_Sys_Polymorphic

Polymorphic Inspection Systems and authentication services
     o Polymorphic    Inspection     Systems   (Polymorphic     Authentication
       Terminals/Services) ensure the confidentiality, Privacy, Authenticity
       and integrity of the polymorphic data read from the polymorphic
       eMRTD document (e.g. PACE PIN/PUK, integrity of PKI certificates,
       randomized PI, PP and optional CPI data, etc.), where it is necessary
       for a secure operation of the TOE.
     o Polymorphic Inspection Systems will prevent eavesdropping to their
       communication with the TOE before secure messaging is successfully
       established based on the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1.

   o   Polymorphic Inspection Systems examine the polymorphic eMRTD
       document presented by the polymorphic eMRTD document holder to
       verify its authenticity by means of the physical security measures and
       to detect any manipulation of the physical part of the polymorphic
       eMRTD document.
    o Polymorphic Inspection Systems include the Country Signing CA Public
       Key and implement the respective terminal part of the protocols
       required to execute PACE with PIN, Passive Authentication (PA), CAv1,
       TAv1 authentication according to [TR-03110-2] and Polymorphic
       Authentication (PMA). They are assumed to securely store static IS
       private keys and generate secure temporary session keys and nonces.
    o The Document Verifier authorizes Polymorphic Inspection Systems by
       creation of Inspection System Certificates for access to polymorphic
       user data stored the polymorphic eMRTD document. An Polymorphic
       Inspection Systems authenticates itselve to the polymorphic eMRTD
       document's chip for getting access to the polymorphic data with its
       private Terminal Authentication key and corresponding Inspection
       System Certificate.
Application Note:
This Assumption is an extension of the Assumption 'A.Insp_Sys' defined in
[EAC-PP-V2]. For the EAC functionality of the TOE the assumption is necessary
because it covers the pre-requisite for performing the PACE with PIN, CAv1
and TAv1 authentication.

4 Security Objectives

This chapter describes the security objectives for the TOE and the security
objectives for the TOE environment. The security objectives for the TOE
environment are separated into security objectives for the development and
production environment and security objectives for the operational environment.


4.1 Security Objectives for the TOE
This section describes the security objectives for the TOE addressing the aspects
of identified threats to be countered by the TOE and organizational security
policies to be met by the TOE.

  exchange between the TOE and the terminal connected (and represented by
  PACE authenticated BIS-PACE)after the PACE Authentication. It shall happen
  by enabling such a verification at the terminal-side (at receiving by the
  terminal) and by an active verification by the TOE itself (at receiving by the
  TOE).

OT.Data_Confidentiality
  Confidentiality of Data
  The TOE must ensure confidentiality of the User Data and the TSF-data by
  granting read access only to the PACE authenticated BIS-PACE connected. The

  communication via the contactless/contact interface of the TOE without
  knowledge of the correct values of shared passwords (PACE passwords) in
  advance.

OT.Prot_Abuse-Func
  Protection against Abuse of Functionality
  The TOE must prevent that functions of the TOE, which may not be used in
  TOE operational phase, can be abused in order (i) to manipulate or to disclose
  the User Data stored in the TOE, (ii) to manipulate or to disclose the TSF-data
  stored in the TOE, (iii) to manipulate (bypass, deactivate or modify) soft-

OT.Prot_Inf_Leak
  Potection against Information Leakage The TOE must provide protection
  against disclosure of confidential User Data or/and TSF-data stored and/or
  processed by the travel document
      by measurement and analysis of the shape and amplitude of signals or the
        time between events found by measuring signals on the electromagnetic
        field, power consumption, clock, or I/O lines,
      by forcing a malfunction of the TOE and/or
      by a physical manipulation of the TOE.

OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper
  Protection against Physical Tampering
  The TOE must provide protection the confidentiality and integrity of the User
  Data, the TSF Data, and the MRTD’s chip Embedded Software. This includes
  protection against attacks with high attack potential by means of
      measuring through galvanic contacts which is direct physical probing on
        the chips surface except on pads being bonded (using standard tools for
        measuring voltage and current) or
      measuring not using galvanic contacts but other types of physical
        interaction between charges (using tools used in solid-state physics
        research and IC failure analysis)
      manipulation of the hardware and its security features, as well as
      controlled manipulation of memory contents (User Data, TSF Data) with a
        prior
      reverse-engineering to understand the design and its properties and
        functions.

OT.Polymorphic_Data_Confidentiality
  Confidentiality of eMRTD polymorphic data
  The TOE must ensure the confidentiality of the sensitive static polymorphic
  eMRTD PI, PP and CPI user data stored on the TOE during personalisation by
  denying all read access to everybody. Only read access to the randomized
  representation of the polymorphic user data is possible and only granted to
  authorized and authenticated Polymorphic Authentication Terminals/Services.
  The TOE must ensure the confidentiality of the eMRTD polymorphic User Data
  (randomized PI, PP and optional CPI) during their exchange between the TOE
  and the Polymorphic Authentication terminal/Service connected after
  successfully executing the sequence of PACE with PIN, PA, CAv1, TAv1 and
  PMA authentication.
  Application Note:
  This OT is an extension of the OTs ‘OT.Sens_Data_Conf’ and
  ‘OT.Data_Confidentiality’ defined in [PACE-PP] and [EAC-PP-V2] respectively
  to ensure the confidentiality of the sensitive polymorphic eMRTD PI/PP/CPI

  with the connected Polymorphic Authentication Terminal/Service. This
  extension does not conflict with the strict conformance to PACE and EACv1
  PPs.

OT.Polymorphic_Data_Integrity
  Integrity of eMRTD polymorphic data
  The TOE must ensure the Integrity of the sensitive polymorphic eMRTD PI, PP
  and CPI data and PIN/PUK data stored on it by protecting these data against
  unauthorised     modification     (physical  manipulation and    unauthorised
  modifying).
  Application Note:
  This OT is an extension of the OT ‘OT.Data_Integrity’ defined in [PACE-PP] to
  ensure the integrity of the polymorphic eMRTD user data. This extension does
  not conflict with the strict conformance to PACE and EACv1 PPs.

OT.Polymorphic_Data_Authenticity
  Authenticity of eMRTD polymorphic data
  The TOE must ensure the authenticity of the polymorphic eMRTD randomized
  PI, PP and optional CPI data during their exchange between the TOE and
  Terminal/Authentication Service connected after successfully executing the
  sequence of PACE with PIN, CAv1, TAv1 and PMA.
  Application Note:
  This OT is an extension of the OT ‘OT.Data_Authenticity’ defined in [PACE-PP]
  to ensure the authenticity of the polymorphic eMRTD PI/PP/CPI data. This
  extension does not conflict with the strict conformance to PACE and EACv1
  PPs.

OT.Polymorphic_Data_Privacy
  Privacy of eMRTD polymorphic user data
  The TOE guarantees the privacy of the PI, PP and optional CPI user data by
  randomising the PI, PP and optional CPI user data during the polymorphic
  authentication (PMA), prior to returning it to the authorised Polymorphic
  Authentication Terminal/Service. This prevents the Authenication Service from
  being able to harvest any user or card unique identifiable data.
  Application Note:
  This OT has been added to this ST to ensure and maintain the privacy of the
  polymorphic     PI, PP and optional CPI user data during the Polymorphic
  Authentication (sequence of PACE with PIN, CAv1, TAv1 and PMA). This
  addition does not conflict with the strict conformance to PACE and EACv1 PPs.

  This OT is an extension of the OT ‘OT.AC_Pers’ defined in [PACE-PP] to ensure
  that the polymorphic eMRTD data PI/PP/CPI and PIN/PUK are written by
  authorized Personalisation Agents only. This extension does not conflict with
  the strict conformance to PACE and EACv1 PPs.

OT.DoS
  PIN and PUK are blocking PACE passwords. Therefore the number of incorrect
  authentication attempts on the PACE PIN and PUK passwords shall be
  controlled by the TOE to prevent a denial of service.

  The TOE shall implement the suspend and resume mechanisms specified in
  [TR-3110-2] for blocking PACE passwords, PIN and (if present) PUK.



4.2 Security Objectives for the Operational Environment


4.2.1 Issuing State or Organisation
The Issuing State or Organization will implement the following security objectives
of the TOE environment.


OE.Legislative_Compliance
  Issuing of the travel document
  The travel document Issuer must issue the travel document and approve it
  using the terminals complying with all applicable laws and regulations.

OE.Auth_Key_Travel_Document
  Travel document Authentication Key
  The issuing State or Organisation has to establish the necessary public key
  infrastructure in order to (i) generate the travel document’s Chip
  Authentication Key Pair, (ii) sign and store the Chip Authentication Public Key
  in the Chip Authentication Public Key data in EF.DG14 and (iii) support
  inspection systems of receiving States or Organisations to verify the
  authenticity of the travel document’s chip used for genuine travel document by
  certification of the Chip Authentication Public Key by means of the Document
  Security Object.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to counter the Threat
  T.Counterfeit as it specifies the pre-requisite for the Chip Authentication
  Protocol Version 1 which is one of the additional features of the TOE described
  only in [EAC-PP-V2] and not in [PACE-PP].

OE.Auth_Key_MRTD
  MRTD Authentication Key4
  The issuing State or Organization has to establish the necessary public key
  infra-structure in order to (i) generate the MRTD’s Active Authentication Key
  Pair, (ii) sign and store the Active Authentication Public Key in the Active
  Authentication Public Key data in EF.DG15 (if generated) and (iii) support
  inspection systems of receiving States or organizations to verify the
  authenticity of the MRTD’s chip used for genuine MRTD by certification of the
  Active Authentication Public Key by means of the Document Security Object.



OE.Authoriz_Sens_Data
  Authorization for Use of Sensitive Biometric Reference Data
  The issuing State or Organisation has to establish the necessary public key
  infrastructure in order to limit the access to sensitive biometric reference data
  of travel document holders to authorized receiving States or Organisations.
  The Country Verifying Certification Authority of the issuing State or
  Organisation generates card verifiable Document Verifier Certificates for the
  authorized Document Verifier only.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Read_Sensitive_Data, the Organisational Security Policy P.Sensitive_Data
  and the Assumption A.Auth_PKI as it specifies the pre-requisite for the
  Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 as it concerns the need of an PKI for this
  protocol and the responsibilities of its root instance. The Terminal
  Authentication Protocol v.1 is one of the additional features of the TOE
  described only in [EAC-PP-V2] and not in [PACE-PP].

4.2.2 Travel document Issuer and CSCA: travel document PKI
(issuing) branch
The travel document Issuer and the related CSCA will implement the following
security objectives for the TOE environment:


OE.Passive_Auth_Sign
  Authentication of travel document by Signature.
  The travel document Issuer has to establish the necessary public key
  infrastructure as follows: the CSCA acting on behalf and according to the

  contains only the hash values of genuine user data according to [ICAO-9303].
  The CSCA must issue its certificates exclusively to the rightful organisations
  (DS) and DSs must sign exclusively correct Document Security Objects to be
  stored on travel document.

OE.Personalisation
  Personalisation of travel document
  The travel document Issuer must ensure that the Personalisation Agents
  acting on his behalf
      (i) establish the correct identity of the travel document holder and create
          the biographical data for the travel document,
      (ii) enroll the biometric reference data of the travel document holder,

4.2.3 Terminal operator: Terminal receiving branch

OE.Terminal
  Terminal operating
  The terminal operators must operate their terminals as follows:
     1.) The related terminals (basic inspection systems, cf. above) are used by
        terminal operators and by travel document holders as defined in [ICAO-
        9303].
     2.) The related terminals implement the terminal parts of the PACE
        protocol [ICAO-9303] part 11, of the Passive Authentication [ICAO-
        9303] part 11 (by verification of the signature of the Document Security

         generating ephemeral keys for Diffie-Hellmann).
      3.) The related terminals need not to use any own credentials.
      4.) The related terminals securely store the Country Signing Public Key
         and the Document Signer Public Key (in form of CCSCA and CDS) in
         order to enable and to perform Passive Authentication of the travel
         document (determination of the authenticity of data groups stored in
         the travel document, [ICAO-9303] part 12).
      5.) The related terminals and their environment must ensure
         confidentiality and integrity of respective data handled by them (e.g.
         confidentiality of the PACE passwords, integrity of PKI certificates, etc.),
         where it is necessary for a secure operation of the TOE according to the
         current PP.

4.2.4 Travel document holder Obligations

OE.Travel_Document_Holder
  Travel document holder Obligations
  The travel document holder may reveal, if necessary, his or her verification
  values of the PACE password to an authorized person or device who definitely
  act according to respective regulations and are trustworthy.

4.2.5 Receiving State or Organisation

OE.Exam_Travel_Document
  Examination of the physical part of the travel document
  The inspection system of the receiving State or Organisation must examine
  the travel document presented by the traveler to verify its authenticity by
  means of the physical security measures and to detect any manipulation of the
  physical part of the travel document. The Basic Inspection System for global
  interoperability (i) includes the Country Signing CA Public Key and the
  Document Signer Public Key of each issuing State or Organisation, and (ii)
  implements the terminal part of PACE [ICAO-9303] part 11 and/or the Basic
  Access Control [ICAO-9303]. Extended Inspection Systems perform
  additionally to these points the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1 to verify
  the Authenticity of the presented travel document’s chip.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Counterfeit and the Assumption A.Insp_Sys by demanding the Inspection
  System       to     perform     the     Chip     Authentication     protocolv.1.
  OE.Exam_Travel_Document also repeats partly the requirements from
  OE.Terminal in [PACE-PP] and therefore also counters T.Forgery and A.
  Passive_Auth from [PACE-PP]. This is done because a new type of Inspection
  System is introduced in this PP as the Extended Inspection System is needed

      Control.


OE.AA_MRTD
      Active Authentication - Inspection Systems5
      An Active Authentication (Basic, General or Extended) Inspection system
      performs all the functions of the Basic, General and Extended Inspection
      System, and verifies the IC authenticity with an RSA or ECDSA signature
      generated by the MRTD (if available).



OE.Prot_Logical_Travel_Document
  Protection of data from the logical travel document
  The inspection system of the receiving State or Organisation ensures the
  confidentiality and integrity of the data read from the logical travel document.
  The inspection system will prevent eavesdropping to their communication with
  the TOE before secure messaging is successfully established based on the Chip
  Authentication Protocol Version 1.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP]in order to handle the Assumption
  A.Insp_Sys by requiring the Inspection System to perform secure messaging
  based on the Chip Authentication Protocol v.1.

OE.Ext_Insp_Systems
  Authorization of Extended Inspection Systems
  The Document Verifier of receiving States or Organisations authorizes
  Extended Inspection Systems by creation of Inspection System Certificates for
  access to sensitive biometric reference data of the logical travel document.
  The Extended Inspection System authenticates themselves to the travel
  document’s chip for access to the sensitive biometric reference data with its
  private Terminal Authentication Key and its Inspection System Certificate.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Read_Sensitive_Data, the Organisational Security Policy P.Sensitive_Data
  and the Assumption A. Auth_PKI as it specifies the pre-requisite for the
  Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 as it concerns the responsibilities of the
  Document Verifier and the Inspection Systems.

4.3 Security Objectives Rationale

4.3.1 Threats

4.3.1.1 Threats listed in PP PACE

T.Skimming addresses accessing the User Data (stored on the TOE or
  transferred between the TOE and the terminal) using the TOE's
  contactless/contact interface. This threat is countered by the security
  objectives        OT.Data_Integrity,        OT.Data_Authenticity        and
  OT.Data_Confidentiality through the PACE authentication. The objective
  OE.Travel_Document_Holder ensures that a PACE session can only be
  established either by the travel document holder itself or by an authorised
  person or device, and, hence, cannot be captured by an attacker.

T.Eavesdropping addresses listening to the communication between the TOE
  and a rightful terminal in order to gain the User Data transferred there. This
  threat is countered by the security objective OT.Data_Confidentiality through a
  trusted channel based on the PACE authentication.

T.Tracing addresses gathering TOE tracing data identifying it remotely by
  establishing or listening to a communication via the contactless/contact
  interface of the TOE, whereby the attacker does not a priori know the correct
  values of the PACE password. This threat is directly countered by security
  objectives    OT.Tracing   (no    gathering   TOE     tracing    data)   and
  OE.Travel_Document_Holder (the attacker does not a priori know the correct
  values of the shared passwords).

T.Forgery 'Forgery of data' addresses the fraudulent, complete or partial
  alteration of the User Data or/and TSF-data stored on the TOE or/and
  exchanged between the TOE and the terminal. Additionally to the security
  objectives from PACE PP [PACE-PP] which counter this threat, the examination
  of     the     presented   MRTD       passport    book       according    to
  OE.Exam_Travel_Document 'Examination of the physical part of the travel
  document' shall ensure its authenticity by means of the physical security
  measures and detect any manipulation of the physical part of the travel
  document.
  The threat T.Forgery also addresses the fraudulent, complete or partial
  alteration of the User Data or/and TSF-data stored on the TOE or/and

  exchanged between the TOE and the terminal. The security objective
  OT.AC_Pers requires the TOE to limit the write access for the travel document
  to the trustworthy Personalisation Agent (cf. OE.Personalisation). The TOE will
  protect the integrity and authenticity of the stored and exchanged User Data
  or/and TSF-data as aimed by the security objectives OT.Data_Integrity and
  OT.Data_Authenticity, respectively. The objectives OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper and
  OT.Prot_Abuse-Func contribute to protecting integrity of the User Data or/and
  TSF-data stored on the TOE. A terminal operator operating his terminals
  according to OE.Terminal and performing the Passive Authentication using the
  Document Security Object as aimed by OE.Passive_Auth_Sign will be able to
  effectively verify integrity and authenticity of the data received from the TOE.

T.Abuse-Func addresses attacks of misusing TOE's functionality to manipulate
  or to disclosure the stored User- or TSF-data as well as to disable or to bypass
  the soft-coded security functionality. The security objective OT.Prot_Abuse-
  Func ensures that the usage of functions having not to be used in the
  operational phase is effectively prevented.

T.Information_Leakage is typical for integrated circuits like smart cards under
  direct attack with high attack potential. The protection of the TOE against this
  threat is obviously addressed by the directly related security objective
  OT.Prot_Inf_Leak.

T.Phys-Tamper is typical for integrated circuits like smart cards under direct
  attack with high attack potential. The protection of the TOE against this threat
  is obviously addressed by the directly related security objective OT.Prot_Phys-
  Tamper.

T.Malfunction is typical for integrated circuits like smart cards under direct
  attack with high attack potential. The protection of the TOE against this threat
  is obviously addressed by the directly related security objective
  OT.Prot_Malfunction.

4.3.1.2 Additional Threats

T.Read_Sensitive_Data The threat T.Read_Sensitive_Data 'Read the sensitive

  OT.Sens_Data_Conf 'Confidentiality of sensitive biometric reference data'
  requiring that read access to EF.DG3 and EF.DG4 (containing the sensitive
  biometric reference data) is only granted to authorized inspection systems.
  Furthermore it is required that the transmission of these data ensures the
  data's confidentiality. The authorization bases on Document Verifier
  certificates issued by the issuing State or Organisation as required by
  OE.Authoriz_Sens_Data 'Authorization for use of sensitive biometric reference

  OE.Ext_Insp_Systems 'Authorization of Extended Inspection Systems'.

T.Counterfeit 'Counterfeit of travel document chip data' addresses the attack of
  unauthorized copy or reproduction of the genuine travel document's chip. This
  attack is thwarted by chip an identification and authenticity proof required by
  OT.Chip_Auth_Proof 'Proof of travel document's chip authentication' using an
  authentication key pair to be generated by the issuing State or Organisation.
  The Public Chip Authentication Key has to be written into EF.DG14 and signed
  by    means     of  Documents       Security    Objects    as   demanded     by
  OE.Auth_Key_Travel_Document 'Travel document Authentication Key'.
  According to OE.Exam_Travel_Document 'Examination of the physical part of
  the travel document' the General Inspection system has to perform the Chip
  Authentication Protocol Version 1 to verify the authenticity of the travel
  document's chip. Moreover, the Active Authentication Public Key has to be
  written into EF.DG15 as demanded by OE.Auth_Key_MRTD 'MRTD
  Authentication Key'. According to OE.AA_MRTD 'Active Authentication -
  Inspection Systems' the Inspection system has to perform the Active
  Authentication Protocol to verify the authenticity of the MRTD’s chip.

5 Extended Requirements


5.1 Definition of the Family FAU_SAS
To describe the security functional requirements of the TOE, the family FAU_SAS
of the class FAU (Security Audit) is defined here. This family describes the
functional requirements for the storage of audit data. It has a more general
approach than FAU_GEN, because it does not necessarily require the data to be
generated by the TOE itself and because it does not give specific details of the
content of the audit records.

The family “Audit data storage (FAU_SAS)” is specified as follows:

Family behavior:

This family defines functional requirements for the storage of audit data.

Component leveling:




FAU_SAS.1          Requires the TOE to provide the possibility to store audit data.

Management:        FAU_SAS.1
                   There are no management activities foreseen.

Audit:             FAU_SAS.1
                   There are no actions defined to be auditable.

FAU_SAS.1 Audit Storage


Hierarchical to:   No other components.

Dependencies:      No dependencies.

FAU_SAS.1.1 The TSF shall provide [assignment: authorized users] with the
  capability to store [assignment: list of audit information] in the audit records.


5.2 Definition of the Family FCS_RND
To describe the IT security functional requirements of the TOE, the family
FCS_RND of the class FCS (Cryptographic support) is defined here. This family
describes the functional requirements for random number generation used for
cryptographic purposes. The component FCS_RND.1 is not limited to generation

of cryptographic keys unlike the component FCS_CKM.1. The similar component
FIA_SOS.2 is intended for non-cryptographic use.

The family “Generation of random numbers (FCS_RND)” is specified as follows:

Family behavior:

This family defines quality requirements for the generation of random numbers
which are intended to be used for cryptographic purposes.

Component leveling:




FCS_RND.1        Generation of random numbers requires that random
numbers meet a defined quality metric.

Management:        FCS_RND.1
                   There are no management activities foreseen.

Audit:             FCS_RND.1
                   There are no actions defined to be auditable.

FCS_RND.1 Quality Metric for Random Numbers


Hierarchical to:   No other components.

Dependencies:      No dependencies.

FCS_RND.1.1 The TSF shall provide a mechanism to generate random numbers
  that meet [assignment: a defined quality metric].


5.3 Definition of the Family FIA_API
To describe the IT security functional requirements of the TOE a sensitive family
(FIA_API) of the Class FIA (Identification and authentication) is defined here.
This family describes the functional requirements for the proof of the claimed
identity for the authentication verification by an external entity where the other
families of the class FIA address the verification of the identity of an external
entity.

The family “Authentication Proof of Identity (FIA_API)” is specified as follows:

                                                                       Ref.:

                          eMRTD Configuration)

Family behavior:

This family defines functions provided by the TOE to prove their identity and to
be verified by an external entity in the TOE IT environment.

Component levelling:




FIA_API.1                  Authentication Proof of Identity.

Management:                FIA_API.1

         The following actions could be considered for the management functions in
         FMT: Management of authentication information used to prove the claimed
         identity.

Audit:                     There are no actions defined to be auditable.

FIA_API.1 Authentication Proof of Identity


Hierarchical to:     No other components.

Dependencies:        No dependencies.

FIA_API.1.1 The TSF shall provide a [assignment: authentication mechanism]
  to prove the identity of the [assignment: authorized user or role].


5.4 Definition of the Family FMT_LIM
The family FMT_LIM describes the functional requirements for the test features of
the TOE. The new functional requirements were defined in the class FMT because
this class addresses the management of functions of the TSF. The examples of
the technical mechanism used in the TOE show that no other class is appropriate
to address the specific issues of preventing abuse of functions by limiting the
capabilities of the functions and by limiting their availability.

The family “Limited capabilities and availability (FMT_LIM)” is specified as
follows:

Family behavior:

This family defines requirements that limit the capabilities and availability of
functions in a combined manner. Note that FDP_ACF restricts the access to
functions whereas the Limited capability of this family requires the functions
themselves to be designed in a specific manner.

                         eMRTD Configuration)


Component leveling:




FMT_LIM.1           Limited capabilities requires that the TSF is built to provide
only the capabilities (perform action, gather information) necessary for its
genuine purpose.

FMT_LIM.2           Limited availability requires that the TSF restrict the use of
functions (refer to Limited capabilities (FMT_LIM.1)). This can be achieved, for
instance, by removing or by disabling functions in a specific phase of the TOE’s
lifecycle.

Management:         FMT_LIM.1, FMT_LIM.2
                    There are no management activities foreseen.

Audit:              FMT_LIM.1, FMT_LIM.2
                    There are no actions defined to be auditable.



FMT_LIM.1 Limited Capabilities


Hierarchical to:    No other components.

Dependencies:       FMT_LIM.2 Limited availability.

FMT_LIM.1.1 The TSF shall be designed in a manner that limits their capabilities
  so that in conjunction with “Limited availability (FMT_LIM.2)” the following
  policy is enforced [assignment: Limited capability and availability policy].



FMT_LIM.2 Limited Availability


Hierarchical to: No other components.

Dependencies: FMT_LIM.1 Limited capabilities.

FMT_LIM.2.1 The TSF shall be designed in a manner that limits their availability
  so that in conjunction with ”Limited capabilities (FMT_LIM.1)” the following
  policy is enforced [assignment: Limited capability and availability policy].

5.5 Definition of the Family FPT_EMS
The family FPT_EMS (TOE Emanation) of the class FPT (Protection of the TSF) is
defined here to describe the IT security functional requirements of the TOE. The
TOE shall prevent attacks against secret data stored in and used by the TOE
where the attack is based on external observable physical phenomena of the
TOE. Examples of such attacks are evaluation of TOE’s electromagnetic radiation,
simple power analysis (SPA), differential power analysis (DPA), timing attacks,
etc. This family describes the functional requirements for the limitation of
intelligible emanations being not directly addressed by any other component of
CC part 2.
The family “TOE Emanation (FPT_EMS)” is specified as follows:

Family behavior:

This family defines requirements to mitigate intelligible emanations.

Component leveling:




FPT_EMS.1         TOE emanation has two constituents:
   FPT_EMS.1.1           Limit of Emissions requires to not emit intelligible
   emissions enabling access to TSF data or user data.
   FPT_EMS.1.2           Interface Emanation requires to not emit interface
   emanation enabling access to TSF data or user data.

Management:              FPT_EMS.1
                         There are no management activities foreseen.

Audit:                   FPT_EMS.1
                         There are no actions defined to be auditable.

FPT_EMS.1 TOE Emanation

Hierarchical to: No other components.

Dependencies: No dependencies.

FPT_EMS.1.1 The TOE shall not emit [assignment: types of emissions] in excess
  of [assignment: specified limits] enabling access to [assignment: list of types
  of TSF data] and [assignment: list of types of user data].

FPT_EMS.1.2 The TSF shall ensure [assignment: type of users] are unable to
  use the following interface [assignment: type of connection] to gain access to
  [assignment: list of types of TSF data] and [assignment: list of types of user
  data].

6 Security Requirements

6.1 Security Functional Requirements
This section on security functional requirements for the TOE is divided into sub-
section following the main security functionality. Several SFRs of the PACE PP
[PACE-PP] are only listed in the EAC PP [EAC-PP-V2]. Therefore the descriptions
of these SFRs are taken directly from PACE PP into the Security target on hand

  value of the PIN according to [TR-03110].
Application Note:

This SFR is included from [EACv2-PP]. This SFR is not in conflict to

                      of the memories. The P6022y VB shall support secure operation on Special Function
                      Register depending on register functionality or on the CPU mode. In addition an
                      application shall not be able to access hardware components unless permission is

The TOE provides specific security functionality, which can be used by the Smartcard Embedded Software. In the
following specific security functionality is listed which is not derived from threats identified for the TOE’s
environment because it can only be decided in the context of the smartcard application, against which threats
the Smartcard Embedded Software will use the specific security functionality.
The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the policy “Additional Specific Security Functionality
(P.Add-Functions)” as specified below.

P.Add-Functions                   Additional Specific Security Functionality
                                  The TOE shall provide the following specific security functionality to the
                                  Smartcard Embedded Software:
                                      Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA)
                                      Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC)
                                      CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CCL)
                                      Cipher based Message Authentication Code (CMAC by the SCL-1)

Note 2:
The cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL, and the Toolbox library as stated in chapter 1.1 are delivery
options. Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations of or even without these libraries. In the case of
coming without one or any combination of the cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL, the TOE does not
provide the Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or Elliptic
Curve Cryptography (EC) and/or CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library and/or Cipher based Message Authentication
Code (CMAC by SCL-1).
The Toolbox Library is no cryptographic library, provides no additional specific security functionality and thus the
Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
End of note.

The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the organizational security policy “Cryptographic services of the
TOE (P.Crypto-Service)” as specified below:

 P.Crypto-Service              Cryptographic services of the TOE
                               The TOE provides secure hardware based cryptographic services for the IC
                               Embedded Software.
                                   Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES)
                                   Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

Note 3:
This TOE can come with both cryptographic coprocessors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked
Crypto2304T, or with both crypto co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior
to the production of the hardware. In case the SCP is blocked, no AES and DES respectively CMAC computation
supported by hardware or SCL is possible. In case the Crypto2304T is blocked, no RSA and EC computation – of
any version as stated in chapter 1.1 - supported by hardware is possible. No accessibility of the deselected
cryptographic co-processors is without impact on any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to
the situation where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic co-processors.

4.3           Assumptions
The TOE assumptions on the operational environment are defined and described in PP [9] section 3.4.
The assumptions concern the phases where the TOE has left the chip manufacturer.
The support of cipher schemas requires an additional assumption.

 A.Process-Sec-IC                Protection during Packaging, Finishing and Personalization
                                 It is assumed that security procedures are used after delivery of the TOE by
                                 the TOE Manufacturer up to delivery to the end-consumer to maintain
                                 confidentiality and integrity of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test
                                 data (to prevent any possible copy, modification, retention, theft or
                                 unauthorized use).
 A.Resp-Appl                     Treatment of User data of the Composite TOE
                                 All User data of the Composite TOE are owned by Security IC Embedded
                                 Software. Therefore, it must be assumed that security relevant User data of
                                 the Composite TOE (especially cryptographic keys) are treated by the
                                 Security IC Embedded Software as defined for its specific application context.


4.3.1         Augmented Assumptions
The developer of the Smartcard Embedded Software must ensure the appropriate “Usage of Key-dependent
Functions (A.Key-Function)” while developing this software in Phase 1 as specified below.

 A.Key-Function               Usage of Key-dependent Functions
                              Key-dependent functions (if any) shall be implemented in the Smartcard
                              Embedded Software in a way that they are not susceptible to leakage attacks
                              (as described under T.Leak-Inherent and T.Leak-Forced).

Note that here the routines which may compromise keys when being executed are part of the Smartcard
Embedded Software. In contrast to this the threats T.Leak-Inherent and T.Leak-Forced address (i) the
cryptographic routines which are part of the TOE. For details please refer to PP [9] section 3.4.

4.3.2          Note regarding CIPURSE™ CL
The CIPURSE™ CL as cryptographic functionality establishes a cryptographic secured communication channel
between two identified entities. Depending on the implementation and usage, the CIPURSE™ CL can act either
in the PICC or in the PCD role. In any case the secrets applied for establishing and usage of the secured channel
must be treated in an appropriate way by both entities PICC and PCD.
This means that it is essential on user side that the critical data for establishing this cryptographic secured
communication channel is generated and stored in an appropriate way and that integrity and confidentiality is
maintained.
These preconditions are treated in the PP [9] section 3.1 claims 67 and 68, and are the reason for not placing an
assumption here.

                                  Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA)
                                  Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC)
                                  CIPURSE™ Cryptography
                                  Cipher base Message authentication code (CMAC)

Note 5:
The cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL and the Toolbox library are delivery options, regardless of the
version chosen. Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations of or even without these libraries. In the
case of coming without one or any combination of the cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL the TOE does
not provide the Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC) and/or CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library and/or Cipher based Message
Authentication Code (CMAC by the SCL-1).
The Toolbox Library is no cryptographic library, provides no additional specific security functionality and thus the
Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
End of note.

Note 6:
This TOE can come with both crypto co-processors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked
Crypto2304T, or with both crypto co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior
to the production of the hardware. In case the SCP is blocked, no AES and DES computation supported by
hardware is possible. In case the Crypto2304T is blocked, no RSA and EC computation – in any of the version
stated in chapter 1.1 – supported by hardware is possible. No accessibility of the deselected cryptographic co-
processors is without impact on any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the situation
where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic co-processors.
End of note.

Note 7:
In case the SCP is blocked, no AES, no DES and no Cipher based Message Authentication Code (CMAC by SCL)
computation supported by hardware is possible and thus the CIPURSE™ CL and SCL usage is not possible. This is
regardless of the library version chosen.
End of note.

The TOE shall provide “Area based Memory Access Control (O.Mem-Access)” as specified below.

 O.Mem Access                Area based Memory Access Control
                             The TOE must provide the Smartcard Embedded Software with the capability to
                             define restricted access memory areas. The TOE must then enforce the
                             partitioning of such memory areas so that access of software to memory areas and
                             privilege levels is controlled as required, for example, in a multi-application
                             environment.

of the version in use -, downloading and/or running the operating
system and to establish a clear separation between different applications. Nevertheless, it is also possible to
define a shared memory section where separated applications may exchange defined data. The privilege levels
clearly define by using a hierarchical model the access right from one level to the other. These measures ensure
that the threat T.Mem-Access is clearly covered by the security objective O.Mem-Access.


 5.8           P.Ctrl_Loader, P.Lim_Block_Loader, T.Masquerade_TOE and
               T.Open_Samples_Diffusion
The PP [9] section 7.3 considers the life cycle phases of the TOE also with the organizational policy
P.Lim_Block_Loader and P.Ctlr_Loader as the TOE must be protected against unauthorized usage and control
and against download of malicious software before, during and after the user downloads his software. This is
formalized with the objectives O.Cap_Avail_Loader, O.Authentication and O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader requiring
authentication of the TOE to external entities and a trusted communication channel. The O.Authentication
implements a mutual authentication and involves the environment therefore.
And the policies cover also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must be
regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.
The implemented mutual authentication requires first to authenticate the TOE to the external user. This requires
also knowledge by the user about the sequence of the protocol, interpretation of the transferred data and how to
start the authentication of the TOE. This authentication mean counters the threat T.Masquerade_TOE as only
the genuine TOE is able to identify itself correctly to the enabled user, which covers O.Authentication.
The second step of the mutual authentications mean implements the authentication of the user to the TOE. Only
the user enabled to present the correct authentication data and knowing about the sequence, data
interpretation and signaling of the authentication to the TOE is able to proceed further on.
This enforces OE.TOE_Auth, requiring the support of the verification mechanism and known authentication
reference data by the operational environment.

It is normal business that products enabled for software download by the user are either on their way to the user
or are already stored at user premises. At both situations it cannot be excluded that an attacker could manage to
steal such products enabled for software downloads. The ability to download software on a chip without
operating system and/or application is defined as open sample.
This situation generates the threat T.Open_Samples_Diffusion which is defined as follows:
The download of analysis software could enable an attacker to characterize the product and to construct an
attack path out of the gained information.
This threat is countered by the Flash Loader by following rational:
As long as the Flash Loader is active, controlled usage to the Flash Loader functionality (P.Ctrl_Loader) is
enforced which protects the TOE from achieving the status of being an open sample. And more, even the
attacker could observe, meaning in the sense of measurements during, or induce faults during an authorized
download, the Flash Loader protects the user data of the download by confidentiality and integrity protection
means. The Flash Loader functionalities of mutual authentication, establishing a dedicated trusted
communication channel, the encryption and integrity protection means cover the objectives
O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality, O.Leak-Inherent and O.Leak-Forced.
The policy P.Ctrl_Loader covers also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must
be regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.

Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


The algorithm strength of the Flash Loader has not been cryptographic-analytically evaluated by the BSI, as
Infineon has implemented a proprietary extension.
End of note.

The objective O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader Access control and authenticity for the Loader is covered by following
rational:
The identification of the communication entities of the Flash Loader requires the presence of dedicated
identification data for passing successfully the mutual authentication. This enforces the policy P.Ctrl_Loader
comprising the aspect of the mutual authentication. After successful authentication the user is enabled to
change the keys used for authentication and downloading the user data. This first user is defined as the
administrator. The TOE can then further be operated for example by a service partner who is defined as being
the Download Operator. The equal protecting means as for the Administrator apply here again but due to the
key change different roles are established. The Download Operator downloads then the encrypted user data
with the Flash Loader into the defined and accessible SOLID FLASH™ NVM area. This area is access protected by
the MMU.

OE.Travel_Document_Holder
  Travel document holder Obligations
  The travel document holder may reveal, if necessary, his or her verification
  values of the PACE password to an authorized person or device who definitely
  act according to respective regulations and are trustworthy.

4.2.5 Receiving State or Organisation

OE.Exam_Travel_Document
  Examination of the physical part of the travel document
  The inspection system of the receiving State or Organisation must examine
  the travel document presented by the traveler to verify its authenticity by
  means of the physical security measures and to detect any manipulation of the
  physical part of the travel document. The Basic Inspection System for global
  interoperability (i) includes the Country Signing CA Public Key and the
  Document Signer Public Key of each issuing State or Organisation, and (ii)
  implements the terminal part of PACE [ICAO-9303] part 11 and/or the Basic
  Access Control [ICAO-9303]. Extended Inspection Systems perform
  additionally to these points the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1 to verify
  the Authenticity of the presented travel document’s chip.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Counterfeit and the Assumption A.Insp_Sys by demanding the Inspection
  System       to     perform     the     Chip     Authentication     protocolv.1.
  OE.Exam_Travel_Document also repeats partly the requirements from
  OE.Terminal in [PACE-PP] and therefore also counters T.Forgery and A.
  Passive_Auth from [PACE-PP]. This is done because a new type of Inspection
  System is introduced in this PP as the Extended Inspection System is needed

OE.AA_MRTD
      Active Authentication - Inspection Systems5
      An Active Authentication (Basic, General or Extended) Inspection system
      performs all the functions of the Basic, General and Extended Inspection
      System, and verifies the IC authenticity with an RSA or ECDSA signature
      generated by the MRTD (if available).



OE.Prot_Logical_Travel_Document
  Protection of data from the logical travel document
  The inspection system of the receiving State or Organisation ensures the
  confidentiality and integrity of the data read from the logical travel document.
  The inspection system will prevent eavesdropping to their communication with
  the TOE before secure messaging is successfully established based on the Chip
  Authentication Protocol Version 1.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP]in order to handle the Assumption
  A.Insp_Sys by requiring the Inspection System to perform secure messaging
  based on the Chip Authentication Protocol v.1.

OE.Ext_Insp_Systems
  Authorization of Extended Inspection Systems
  The Document Verifier of receiving States or Organisations authorizes
  Extended Inspection Systems by creation of Inspection System Certificates for
  access to sensitive biometric reference data of the logical travel document.
  The Extended Inspection System authenticates themselves to the travel
  document’s chip for access to the sensitive biometric reference data with its
  private Terminal Authentication Key and its Inspection System Certificate.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Read_Sensitive_Data, the Organisational Security Policy P.Sensitive_Data
  and the Assumption A. Auth_PKI as it specifies the pre-requisite for the
  Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 as it concerns the responsibilities of the
  Document Verifier and the Inspection Systems.

     o The TOE communicates only with a Trustworthy Authentication
        Service/Terminal during the Polymorphic eMRTD authentication process
        steps (i.e. during sequence of PACE with PIN, PA, CAv1, TAv1 and
        PMA).
     o The authorized Polymorphic Authentication Service/Terminal has to
        ensure that the randomised PP, PI and optional CPI are securely
        received and transformed by the central Key Management Authority.
        This comprises:
         eMRTD       document      authentication   by   performing   Passive
            Authentication (SOD and DG14) signature verification and Chip
            Authentication (CAv1), being part of the Polymorphic Authentication
            process steps (i.e. sequence of PACE with PIN, PA, CAv1, TAv1 and
            PMA).
         eMRTD document status validation by encryption of the randomized
            PP received from the TOE using the public key of the eMRTD
            document Status Service and sending this with the the
            coresponding meta-data obtained from the TOE to the eMRTD
            document Status Service.

4.3 Security Objectives Rationale

4.3.1 Threats

4.3.1.1 Threats listed in PP PACE

T.Skimming addresses accessing the User Data (stored on the TOE or
  transferred between the TOE and the terminal) using the TOE's
  contactless/contact interface. This threat is countered by the security
  objectives        OT.Data_Integrity,        OT.Data_Authenticity        and
  OT.Data_Confidentiality through the PACE authentication. The objective
  OE.Travel_Document_Holder ensures that a PACE session can only be
  established either by the travel document holder itself or by an authorised
  person or device, and, hence, cannot be captured by an attacker.

T.Eavesdropping addresses listening to the communication between the TOE
  and a rightful terminal in order to gain the User Data transferred there. This
  threat is countered by the security objective OT.Data_Confidentiality through a
  trusted channel based on the PACE authentication.

T.Tracing addresses gathering TOE tracing data identifying it remotely by
  establishing or listening to a communication via the contactless/contact
  interface of the TOE, whereby the attacker does not a priori know the correct
  values of the PACE password. This threat is directly countered by security
  objectives    OT.Tracing   (no    gathering   TOE     tracing    data)   and
  OE.Travel_Document_Holder (the attacker does not a priori know the correct
  values of the shared passwords).

T.Forgery 'Forgery of data' addresses the fraudulent, complete or partial
  alteration of the User Data or/and TSF-data stored on the TOE or/and
  exchanged between the TOE and the terminal. Additionally to the security
  objectives from PACE PP [PACE-PP] which counter this threat, the examination
  of     the     presented   MRTD       passport    book       according    to
  OE.Exam_Travel_Document 'Examination of the physical part of the travel
  document' shall ensure its authenticity by means of the physical security
  measures and detect any manipulation of the physical part of the travel
  document.
  The threat T.Forgery also addresses the fraudulent, complete or partial
  alteration of the User Data or/and TSF-data stored on the TOE or/and

A.      Certification

1.      Preliminary Remarks
Under the BSIG1 Act, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) has the task of
issuing certificates for information technology products.
Certification of a product is carried out on the instigation of the vendor or a distributor,
hereinafter called the sponsor.
A part of the procedure is the technical examination (evaluation) of the product according
to the security criteria published by the BSI or generally recognised security criteria.
The evaluation is normally carried out by an evaluation facility recognised by the BSI or by
BSI itself.
The result of the certification procedure is the present Certification Report. This report
contains among others the certificate (summarised assessment) and the detailed
Certification Results.
The Certification Results contain the technical description of the security functionality of
the certified product, the details of the evaluation (strength and weaknesses) and
instructions for the user.

2.      Specifications of the Certification Procedure
The certification body conducts the procedure according to the criteria laid down in the
following:
●   Act on the Federal Office for Information Security 1
●   BSI Certification and Approval Ordinance2
●   BSI Schedule of Costs3
●   Special decrees issued by the Bundesministerium des Innern (Federal Ministry of the
    Interior)
●   DIN EN ISO/IEC 17065 standard
●   BSI certification: Scheme documentation describing the certification process (CC-
    Produkte) [3]
●   BSI certification: Scheme documentation on requirements for the Evaluation Facility, its

3.      Recognition Agreements
In order to avoid multiple certification of the same product in different countries a mutual
recognition of IT security certificates - as far as such certificates are based on ITSEC or
CC - under certain conditions was agreed.

3.1.    European Recognition of CC – Certificates (SOGIS-MRA)
The SOGIS-Mutual Recognition Agreement (SOGIS-MRA) Version 3 became effective in
April 2010. It defines the recognition of certificates for IT-Products at a basic recognition
level and, in addition, at higher recognition levels for IT-Products related to certain SOGIS
Technical Domains only.
The basic recognition level includes Common Criteria (CC) Evaluation Assurance Levels
EAL 1 to EAL 4. For "Smartcards and similar devices" a SOGIS Technical Domain is in
place. For "HW Devices with Security Boxes" a SOGIS Technical Domains is in place, too.
In addition, certificates issued for Protection Profiles based on Common Criteria are part of
the recognition agreement.
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes, details on
recognition, and the history of the agreement can be seen on the website at
https://www.sogisportal.eu.
The SOGIS-MRA logo printed on the certificate indicates that it is recognised under the
terms of this agreement by the related bodies of the signatory nations. A disclaimer
beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of recognition.
This certificate is recognized under SOGIS-MRA for all assurance components selected.

3.2.    International Recognition of CC – Certificates (CCRA)
The international arrangement on the mutual recognition of certificates based on the CC
(Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement, CCRA-2014) has been ratified on 08
September 2014. It covers CC certificates based on collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP)
(exact use), CC certificates based on assurance components up to and including EAL 2 or
the assurance family Flaw Remediation (ALC_FLR) and CC certificates for Protection
Profiles and for collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP).
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes can be seen on
the website: https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org.
The Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement logo printed on the certificate indicates
that this certification is recognised under the terms of this agreement by the related bodies
of the signatory nations. A disclaimer beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of
recognition.

CC part 3 EAL 2+ ALC_FLR components.

4.      Performance of Evaluation and Certification
The certification body monitors each individual evaluation to ensure a uniform procedure, a
uniform interpretation of the criteria and uniform ratings.
The product IFX_CCI_000Dh, IFX_CCI_0020h, IFX_CCI_0031h, IFX_CCI_0032h,
IFX_CCI_0034h, IFX_CCI_0037h design step T31 and M31 with optional HSL v2.62.7626,
optional SCL version v2.04.003, UMSLC lib v01.00.0234 with specific IC-dedicated
firmware identifier 80.301.05.1 and user guidance has undergone the certification
procedure at BSI.
The evaluation of the product IFX_CCI_000Dh, IFX_CCI_0020h, IFX_CCI_0031h,
IFX_CCI_0032h, IFX_CCI_0034h, IFX_CCI_0037h design step T31 and M31 with optional
HSL v2.62.7626, optional SCL version v2.04.003, UMSLC lib v01.00.0234 with specific IC-
dedicated firmware identifier 80.301.05.1 and user guidance was conducted by TÜV
Informationstechnik GmbH. The evaluation was completed on 9 October 2019. TÜV
Informationstechnik GmbH is an evaluation facility (ITSEF) 5 recognised by the certification
body of BSI.
For this certification procedure the sponsor and applicant is: Infineon Technologies AG.
The product was developed by: Infineon Technologies AG.
The certification is concluded with the comparability check and the production of this
Certification Report. This work was completed by the BSI.

5.      Validity of the Certification Result
This Certification Report applies only to the version of the product as indicated. The
confirmed assurance package is valid on the condition that
●   all stipulations regarding generation, configuration and operation, as given in the
    following report, are observed,
●   the product is operated in the environment described, as specified in the following report
    and in the Security Target.
For the meaning of the assurance components and assurance levels please refer to CC
itself. Detailed references are listed in part C of this report.
The Certificate issued confirms the assurance of the product claimed in the Security Target
at the date of certification. As attack methods evolve over time, the resistance of the
certified version of the product against new attack methods needs to be re-assessed.
Therefore, the sponsor should apply for the certified product being monitored within the
assurance continuity program of the BSI Certification Scheme (e.g. by a re-assessment or
re-certification). Specifically, if results of the certification are used in subsequent evaluation
and certification procedures, in a system integration process or if a user's risk
management needs regularly updated results, it is recommended to perform a re-
assessment on a regular e.g. annual basis.

In order to avoid an indefinite usage of the certificate when evolved attack methods would
require a re-assessment of the products resistance to state of the art attack methods, the
maximum validity of the certificate has been limited. The certificate issued on 15 October
2019 is valid until 14 October 2024. Validity can be re-newed by re-certification.
The owner of the certificate is obliged:
     1. when advertising the certificate or the fact of the product's certification, to refer to
        the Certification Report as well as to provide the Certification Report, the Security
        Target and user guidance documentation mentioned herein to any customer of the
        product for the application and usage of the certified product,
     2. to inform the Certification Body at BSI immediately about vulnerabilities of the
        product that have been identified by the developer or any third party after issuance
        of the certificate,
     3. to inform the Certification Body at BSI immediately in the case that security relevant
        changes in the evaluated life cycle, e.g. related to development and production sites
        or processes, occur, or the confidentiality of documentation and information related
        to the Target of Evaluation (TOE) or resulting from the evaluation and certification
        procedure where the certification of the product has assumed this confidentiality
        being maintained, is not given any longer. In particular, prior to the dissemination of
        confidential documentation and information related to the TOE or resulting from the
        evaluation and certification procedure that do not belong to the deliverables
        according to the Certification Report part B, or for those where no dissemination
        rules have been agreed on, to third parties, the Certification Body at BSI has to be
        informed.
In case of changes to the certified version of the product, the validity can be extended to
the new versions and releases, provided the sponsor applies for assurance continuity (i.e.
re-certification or maintenance) of the modified product, in accordance with the procedural
requirements, and the evaluation does not reveal any security deficiencies.

1.     Executive Summary
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is the IFX_CCI_000Dh, IFX_CCI_0020h, IFX_CCI_0031h,
IFX_CCI_0032h, IFX_CCI_0034h, IFX_CCI_0037h design step T31 and M31 with optional
HSL v2.62.7626, optional SCL version v2.04.003, UMSLC lib v01.00.0234 with specific IC-
dedicated firmware identifier 80.301.05.1 and user guidance.
The Security Target [6] is the basis for this certification. It is based on the certified
Protection Profile Security IC Platform Protection Profile with Augmentation Packages
Version 1.0, 13 January 2014, BSI-CC-PP-0084-2014 [8].
The TOE Security Assurance Requirements (SAR) are based entirely on the assurance
components defined in Part 3 of the Common Criteria (see part C or [1], Part 3 for details).
The TOE meets the assurance requirements of the Evaluation Assurance Level EAL 5
augmented by ALC_DVS.2 and AVA_VAN.5.
The TOE Security Functional Requirements (SFR) relevant for the TOE are outlined in the
Security Target [6] and [9], chapter 6. They are selected from Common Criteria Part 2 and
some of them are newly defined. Thus the TOE is CC Part 2 extended.
The TOE Security Functional Requirements are implemented by the following TOE
Security Functionality:
       TOE Security Functionality            Addressed issue
       SF_DPM                                Device Phase Management:
                                             The life cycle of the TOE is split up into several
                                             phases. Different operation modes help to protect
                                             the TOE during each phase of its lifecycle.
       SF_PS                                 Protection against Snooping:
                                             The TOE uses various means to protect from
                                             snooping.
       SF_PMA                                Protection against Modifying Attacks:
                                             This TOE implements protection            against
                                             modifying attacks of various TOE parts.
       SF_PLA                                Protection against Logical Attacks
       SF_CS                                 Cryptographic Support:
                                             The TOE is equipped with a hardware accelerator
                                             and an optional symmetric cryptographic library
                                             (SCL) to support the standard symmetric
                                             cryptographic operations TDES and AES.
                                             Additionally, the TOE is equipped with a True
                                             Random Number Generator for the generation of
                                             random numbers

                                     Table 2: Deliverables of the TOE
The hardware part of the TOE is identified by its Common Criteria Identifiers (CCI)
IFX_CCI_000Dh, IFX_CCI_0020h, IFX_CCI_0031h, IFX_CCI_0032h, IFX_CCI_0034h
and IFX_CCI_0034h in conjunction with the design steps T31 or M31. The complete chip
identification data is accessible via the Generic Chip Identification Mode (GCIM).
In dependence of the chosen delivery procedure (flashed at developer site or not), the
following remark needs to be taken into account:
As the TOE is under control of the user software, the TOE Manufacturer can only
guarantee the integrity up to the delivery procedure. It is in the responsibility of the
Composite Product Manufacturer to include mechanisms in the implemented software
(developed by the IC Embedded Software Developer) which allows detection of
modifications after the delivery.
In detail, regarding identification:
The Generic Chip Identification Mode (GCIM) can be activated after power-on with a
dedicated signalling sequence and is also accessible by the user software. This GCIM
outputs amongst other identifiers for the platform, chip mode, ROM code, chip type, design
step, fabrication facility, wafer, die position, firmware, temperature range, system
frequency and the CCI. The interpretation of the chip identification data is described in
[12], section 4.6.
Additionally, the customer can identify the present configuration by reading the relevant
data (see [13], section 7.9).
The SCL (optional), UMSLC and HSL library (optional), as separate software parts of the
TOE, are identified by their unique version numbers. The user can identify these versions



                                                                                                     13 / 29
Certification Report                                                      BSI-DSZ-CC-1126-2019




by calculating the hash signatures of the provided library files. The mapping of these hash
signatures to the version numbers is provided in [6] and [9], chapters 9–11.
In detail, regarding delivery:
“TOE Delivery” is uniquely used to indicate
●   after Phase 3 (or before Phase 4) if the TOE is delivered in form of wafers or sawn
    wafers (dice) or
●   after Phase 4 (or before Phase 5) if the TOE is delivered in form of packaged products.
Therefore three different delivering procedures have to be taken into consideration:
●   Delivery of the IC dedicated software components (IC dedicated SW, guidance) from the
    TOE manufacturer to the IC embedded software developer.
●   Delivery of the IC embedded software (ROM / Flash data, initialisation and pre-
    personalization data, Bundle Business package) from the IC embedded software
    developer to the TOE manufacturer.
●   Delivery of the final TOE from the TOE manufacturer to the composite product
    manufacturer. After phase 3 the TOE is delivered in form of wafers or sawn wafers, after
    phase 4 in form of modules (with or without inlay antenna).
The TOE is delivered via the logistics sites:
●   DHL Singapore (Distribution Center Asia),
●   G&D Neustadt,
●   KWE Shanghai,
●   K&N Großostheim (Distribution Center Europe),
●   IFX Morgan Hill.

3.      Security Policy
The security policy enforced is defined by the selected set of Security Functional
Requirements and implemented by the TOE. It covers the following issues:
The Security Policy of the TOE is to provide basic security functionalities to be used by the
smart card operating system and the smart card application, thus providing an overall
smart card system security. Therefore, the TOE will implement a symmetric cryptographic
block cipher algorithm (Triple-DES and AES) to ensure the confidentiality of plain text data
by encryption and to support secure authentication protocols and it will provide a True
Random Number Generator (TRNG).
The optional SCL provides TDES and AES cryptography, which is partly implemented on
the hardware component μSCP and includes countermeasures against SPA, DPA and
DFA attacks. The SCL is delivered as object code and in this way integrated into the user
software.
The optional HSL provides functionality via APIs to the Smartcard Embedded Software,
which contains SOLID FLASH™ NVM service routines and functionality for tearing-safe
programming of SOLID FLASH™ NVM.
The UMSLC library provides a wrapper around the UMSLC hardware functionality with
some software measures to counter fault attacks.



                                                                                        14 / 29
BSI-DSZ-CC-1126-2019                                                        Certification Report




As the TOE is a hardware security platform, the security policy of the TOE is also to
provide protection against leakage of information (e.g. to ensure the confidentiality of
cryptographic keys during AES and Triple-DES cryptographic functions performed by the
TOE), against physical probing, against malfunctions, against physical manipulations and
against abuse of functionality. Hence the TOE shall
●   maintain the integrity and the confidentiality of data stored in the memory of the TOE,
    and
●   maintain the integrity, the correct operation and the confidentiality of security
    functionalities (security mechanisms and associated functions) provided by the TOE.
Specific details concerning the above mentioned security policies can be found in Chapter
7 of the Security Target [6] and [9].

4.      Assumptions and Clarification of Scope
The assumptions defined in the Security Target and some aspects of threats and
Organisational Security Policies are not covered by the TOE itself. These aspects lead to
specific security objectives to be fulfilled and measures to be taken by the IT environment,
the user or the risk manager. The following topics are of relevance:
The ST only includes one security objective for the IC Embedded Software Developer, the
objective OE.Resp-Appl.
The objective OE.Resp-Appl states that the IC Embedded Software Developer shall treat
user data (especially keys) appropriately. The IC Embedded Software Developer gets
sufficient information on how to protect user data adequate in the security guidelines [14].
The ST includes the following security objectives for the operational environment, which
are relevant for the Composite Product Manufacturer: OE.Process-Sec-IC,
OE.Lim_Block_Loader, OE.Loader_Usage and OE.TOE_Auth.
The objective OE.Process-Sec-IC requires the protection of the TOE, as well as of its
manufacturing and test data up to the delivery to the end-consumer. As defined in [6] and
[9] section 1.4.5, the TOE can be delivered to the composite product manufacturer after
phase 3 or after phase 4. However, the single chips are identical in all cases. This means
that the test mode is deactivated and the TOE is locked in the user mode. Therefore it is
not necessary to distinguish between these forms of delivery. Since Infineon has no
information about the security requirements of the implemented IC embedded software it is
not possible to define any concrete security requirements for the environment of the
composite product manufacturer.
The objective OE.TOE_Auth requires that the environment has to support the
authentication and verification mechanism and has to know the corresponding
authentication reference data. The composite product manufacturer receives sufficient
information with regard to the authentication mechanism in [16], section 4.2.2.
The objective OE.Loader_Usage requires that the authorised user has to support the
trusted communication with the TOE by protecting the confidentiality and integrity of the
loaded data and he has to meet the access conditions defined by the flash loader. [15],
section 4 provides sufficient information regarding this topic.
The objective OE.Lim_Block_Loader requires the composite product manufacturer to
protect the loader against misuse, to limit the capability of the loader and to terminate the
loader irreversibly after the intended usage. The permanent deactivation of the flash loader



                                                                                         15 / 29
Certification Report                                                      BSI-DSZ-CC-1126-2019




is described in [16], section 4.5.1.3. This objective for the environment originates from the
“Package 1: Loader dedicated for usage in secured environment only”. However, this TOE
also implements “Package 2: Loader dedicated for usage by authorized users only” and
thus the flash loader can also be used in an unsecure environment and is able to protect
itself against misuse if the authentication and download keys are handled appropriately.

5.       Architectural Information
The TOE is a SmartCard (Security IC). Detailed information on the TOE hardware
architecture is to be found in [6] and [9] section 1.2, 1.3 and especially 1.4.

6.       Documentation
The evaluated documentation as outlined in table 2 is being provided with the product to
the customer. This documentation contains the required information for secure usage of
the TOE in accordance with the Security Target.
Additional obligations and notes for secure usage of the TOE as outlined in chapter 10 of
this report have to be followed.

7.       IT Product Testing
The developer performed the following categories of tests:
     •   Simulation Tests (Design Verification),
     •   Qualification Tests / Software Verification,
     •   Verification Tests and
     •   Production Tests.
The developer tests cover all security functionalities and all security mechanisms as
identified in the functional specification.
The evaluators were able to repeat the tests of the developer either using the library of
programs, tools and prepared chip samples delivered to the evaluator or at the developer’s
site. They performed independent tests to supplement, augment and to verify the tests
performed by the developer. For the developer tests repeated by the evaluators other test
parameters were used and the test equipment was varied. Security features of the TOE
realised by specific design and layout measures were checked by the evaluators during
layout inspections both in design data and on the final product.
The evaluation has shown that the actual version of the TOE provides the security
functionalities as specified by the developer. The test results confirm the correct
implementation of the TOE security functionalities.
For penetration testing the evaluators took all security functionalities into consideration.
Intensive penetration testing was planned based on the analysis results and performed
forthe underlying mechanisms of security functionalities. The penetration tests considered
both the physical tampering of the TOE and attacks which do not modify the TOE
physically. The penetration tests results confirm that the TOE is resistant to attackers with
high attack potential in the intended environment for the TOE.

8.      Evaluated Configuration
This certification covers the following configurations of the TOE:
  IFX_CCI_000Dh, IFX_CCI_0020h, IFX_CCI_0031h, IFX_CCI_0032h, IFX_CCI_0034h,
IFX_CCI_0037h design step T31 and M31 with optional HSL v2.62.7626, optional SCL
    version v2.04.003, UMSLC lib v01.00.0234 with specific IC-dedicated firmware
                       identifier 80.301.05.1 and user guidance
Hardware Configuration:
The hardware of the TOE can be ordered with different SOLID FLASH TM and RAM sizes
(up to 800 kBytes SOLID FLASH™ and up to 20 kBytes RAM). The configuration (as listed
in [6] and [9] table 3 and 4) can be done during the manufacturing process of the TOE
according to the choice of the user. The TOE operating temperature range configuration
options are reflected by the different design steps M31 and T31.
Firmware Packages:
The firmware of the TOE comprises the BOS (FW identifier provided in table 2) and the
Flash Loader (version provided in Table 2). The latter can be configured in three different
ways as outlined in the following:
●   Option 1: The user or/and a subcontractor downloads the software into the SOLID
    FLASH™ memory. Infineon Technologies does not receive any user software.
    Result: Flash Loader can be activated or reactivated by the user or subcontractor to
    download software into the SOLID FLASH™ memory.
●   Option 2: The user provides software to download into the SOLID FLASH™ memory to
    Infineon Technologies AG. The software is loaded into the SOLID FLASH™ memory
    during chip production.
    Result: No Flash Loader present.
●   Option 3: The user provides software to download into the SOLID FLASH™ memory to
    Infineon Technologies AG. The software is loaded into the NVM memory during chip
    production.
    Result: Flash Loader is blocked by Infineon but can be activated or reactivated by the
    user or subcontractor to download software into the SOLID FLASH™ memory. The user
    is required to provide a reactivation procedure as part of the software to Infineon
    Technologies AG.
An overview about the different Flash Loader options is also given in [6] and [9], section
1.4.8.
Optional Software Libraries:
The TOE can be delivered with up to three software libraries, as described in [6] and [9]
section 1.4.1.2. All libraries are delivered as object code and in this way integrated into the
user software.
The optional software libraries listed in Table 2 can be combined according to the
demands of the user. Based on the library selection the TOE can be delivered with or
without the functionality of the HSL and/or SCL library. This is considered in the developer
documentation and corresponding notes are added where required.
If the user decides not to use the HSL and/or SCL library, it is not delivered to the user and
the accompanying additional specific security functionality as listed in Table 2 is not


                                                                                           17 / 29

provided by the TOE. Upon deselection of a library the code implementing the functionality
is excluded and thus this functionality is not available to the user.
Excluding the code of the deselected functionality has no impact on any other security
policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the situation where the user decides just not to
use this functionality.
Evaluation scope:
The ITSEF tested the TOE in those configurations, in which the TOE is delivered, and
which are stated above (and in the ST [6] and [9]).

9.2.    Results of cryptographic assessment
The strength of the cryptographic algorithms was not rated in the course of this certification
procedure (see BSIG Section 9, Para. 4, Clause 2). But cryptographic functionalities with a
security level of lower than 100 bits can no longer be regarded as secure without
considering the application context. Therefore, for these functionalities it shall be checked
whether the related crypto operations are appropriate for the intended system. Some
further hints and guidelines can be derived from the 'Technische Richtlinie BSI TR-02102'
(https://www.bsi.bund.de).
The following table gives an overview of the cryptographic functionalities inside the TOE to
enforce the security policy and outlines its rating from cryptographic point of view. Any
Cryptographic Functionality that is marked in column 'Security Level above 100 Bits' of the
following table with 'no' achieves a security level of lower than 100 Bits (in general context)
only:

The Flash Loader's and the ICS’ (internal ciphering system, see [6] and [9]) cryptographic
strength was not assessed by BSI. However, the evaluation according to the TOE's
Evaluation Assurance Level did not reveal any implementation weaknesses.
Please note, that this holds true also for those algorithms, where no cryptographic 100-Bit-
Level assessment was given. Consequently, the targeted Evaluation Assurance Level has
been achieved for those functionalities as well.
Detailed results on conformance have been compiled into the report [19].

10. Obligations and Notes for the Usage of the TOE
The documents as outlined in table 2 contain necessary information about the usage of the
TOE and all security hints therein have to be considered. In addition all aspects of
Assumptions, Threats and OSPs as outlined in the Security Target not covered by the TOE
itself need to be fulfilled by the operational environment of the TOE.
The customer or user of the product shall consider the results of the certification within his
system risk management process. In order for the evolution of attack methods and
techniques to be covered, he should define the period of time until a re-assessment of the
TOE is required and thus requested from the sponsor of the certificate.
The limited validity for the usage of cryptographic algorithms as outlined in chapter 9 has
to be considered by the user and his system risk management process, too.
Some security measures are partly implemented in this certified TOE, but require
additional configuration or control or measures to be implemented by a product layer on
top, e.g. the Embedded Software using the TOE. For this reason the TOE includes
guidance documentation (see table 2) which contains obligations and guidelines for the
developer of the product layer on top on how to securely use this certified TOE and which
measures have to be implemented in order to fulfil the security requirements of the
Security Target of the TOE. In the course of the evaluation of the composite product or
system it must be examined if the required measures have been correctly and effectively
implemented by the product layer on top. Additionally, the evaluation of the composite
product or system must also consider the evaluation results as outlined in the document
ETR for composite evaluation [10].
At the point in time when evaluation and certification results are reused there might be an
update of the document "ETR for composite evaluation" available. Therefore, the certified
products list on the BSI website has to be checked for latest information on
reassessments, recertifications or maintenance result available for the product.



                                                                                          21 / 29

The Security IC Embedded Software Developer receives all necessary recommendations
and hints to develop his software in form of the delivered documentation.
●    All security hints described in the delivered documents [12]-[14] and [16]-[18] (also listed
     in Table 2) have to be considered.
The Composite Product Manufacturer receives all necessary recommendations and hints
to develop his software in form of the delivered documentation.
●    All security hints described in [15] have to be considered.
In addition the following hints resulting from the evaluation of the ALC evaluation aspect
has to be considered:
●    The IC Embedded Software Developer can deliver his software either to Infineon to let
     them implement it in the TOE (in Flash memory) or to the Composite Product
     Manufacturer to let him download the software in the Flash memory.
●    The delivery procedure from the IC Embedded Software Developer to the Composite
     Product Manufacturer is not part of this evaluation and a secure delivery is required.

11.      Security Target
For the purpose of publishing, the Security Target [9] of the Target of Evaluation (TOE) is
provided within a separate document as Annex A of this report. It is a sanitised version of
the complete Security Target [6] used for the evaluation performed. Sanitisation was
performed according to the rules as outlined in the relevant CCRA policy (see AIS 35 [4]).

 TOE. No management of these security
attribute (i.e. SFR FMT_MSA.1 and FMT_MSA.3) is necessary here.
No. 2: A Diffie-Hellman key agreement is used in order to have no key distribution, therefore FCS_CKM.2
makes no sense in this case.77
No. 3: The Active Authentication key pair cannot be deleted or regenerated.

6.4.3 Security Assurance Requirements Rationale
The EAL5 was chosen to permit a developer to gain maximum assurance from positive security engineering
based on good commercial development practices and a Java card platform that offers cryptographic func-
tionality certified according to EAL5 or higher.
The selection of the component ALC_DVS.2 provides a higher assurance of the security of the travel docu-
ment’s development and manufacturing especially for the secure handling of the travel document’s mate-
rial.
The selection of the component AVA_VAN.5 provides a higher assurance of the security by vulnerability
analysis to assess the resistance to penetration attacks performed by an attacker possessing a high attack
potential. This vulnerability analysis is necessary to fulfil the security objectives OT.Sens_Data_Conf and
OT.Chip_Auth_Proof.
The component ALC_DVS.2 has no dependencies. The component AVA_VAN.5 has the following dependen-
cies:
          ADV_ARC.1 Security architecture description
          ADV_FSP.4 Complete functional specification
          ADV_TDS.3 Basic modular design
          ADV_IMP.1 Implementation representation of the TSF
          AGD_OPE.1 Operational user guidance
          AGD_PRE.1 Preparative procedures
All of these are met or exceeded in the EAL5 assurance package.



77   This justification was taken from [PP0068v2].

6.4.4 Security Requirements – Mutual Support and Internal Consistency
This security target claims strict conformance to the Protection Profiles given insection 2.2. Therefore this
security target includes the analysis of the internal consistency of the Security Requirements of the Protec-
tion Profiles without repeating these here.
As the complete Security Problem Definition, the Extended Components and the Security Functional Re-
quirements have also been included, the consistency analysis of the Protection Profiles is also valid for this
security target.
The additions made to include the Active Authentication Mechansim have been integrated in a consistent
way to the model designed by the Protection Profiles, e. g. by using the subject, object and operation defi-
nitions.
Inconsistency between functional and assurance requirements could only arise if there are functional-as-
surance dependencies which are not met, a possibility which has been shown not to arise in sections 6.3.2
Dependency Rationale and 6.3.3 Security Assurance Requirements Rationale. Furthermore, as also dis-
cussed in section 6.3.3 Security
Assurance Requirements Rationale, the chosen assurance components are adequate for the functionality
of the TOE. So the assurance requirements and security functional requirements support each other and
there are no inconsistencies between the goals ofthese two groups of security requirements.

7 TOE summary specification (ASE_TSS)

7.1 TOE Security Functionality

7.1.1 TSF_Access: Access Control
This security functionality manages the access to objects (files, directories, data and secrets) stored in the
applet’s file system. It also controls write access of initialization, pre-personalization and personalization
data. Access control for initialization and pre-personalization in Phase 2 – while the actual applet is not yet
present – is based on the card manager of the underlying JCOP4 P71 Java Card platform (SF.CM).
Access is granted (or denied) in accordance to access rights that depend on appropriate identification and
authentication mechanisms.
TSF_Access covers the following SFRs:
       FIA_UID.1.1/PACE requires that the TSF shall allow to establish the communication channel, to carry
        out the PACE Protocol, to read the Initialization Data if it is not disabled by TSF according to
        FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS, to carry out the Chip Authentication Protocol, to carry out the Terminal Au-
        thentication Protocol, and to carry out the Active Authentication Mechanism on behalf of the user
        to be performed before the user is identified. FIA_UID.1.2 requires that the TSF shall require each
        user to be successfully identified before allowing any other TSF-mediated actions on behalf of that
        user. TSF_Access realizes the appropriate control of the access rights, TSF_Auth the authentication
        mechanisms.
       FIA_UAU.1/PACE requires that the TSF shall allow to establish the communication channel, to carry
        out the PACE Protocol, to read the Initialization Data if it is not disabled by TSF according to
        FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS, to identify themselves by selection of the authentication key, to carry out the
        Chip Authentication Protocol, to carry out the Terminal Authentication Protocol, and to carry out
        the Active Authentication Mechanism on behalf of the user to be performed before the user is au-
        thenticated. FIA_UAU.1.2 requires that the TSF shall require each user to be successfully authenti-
        cated before allowing any other TSF-mediated actions on behalf of that user. TSF_Access realizes
        the appropriate control of the access rights.
       FIA_UAU.4/PACE requires that the TSF shall prevent reuse of authentication data related to the
        PACE Protocol, the Terminal Authentication Protocol, and the Authentication Mechanism based on
        AES. TSF_Access realizes the appropriate control of the access rights.
       FIA_UAU.5.1/PACE requires that the TSF shall provide the PACE Protocol, Passive Authentication,
        Terminal Authentication, Secure messaging in MAC-ENC mode, Symmetric Authentication Mecha-
        nism based on AES, and the Terminal Authentication Protocol to support user authentication.
        FIA_UAU.5.2/PACE requires that the TSF shall authenticate any user’s claimed identity according to
        specified rules. TSF_Access realizes the appropriate control of the access rights.
       FIA_UAU.6/PACE requires that the TSF shall re-authenticate the user under the condition that each
        command sent to the TOE after successful run of the PACE Protocol shall be verified as being sent
        by the terminal. TSF_Access realizes the appropriate control of the access rights.
       FIA_UAU.6/EAC requires that the TSF shall re-authenticate the user under the condition that each
        command sent to the TOE after successful run of the Chip Authentication Protocol shall be verified
        as being sent by the Inspection System. TSF_Access realizes the appropriate control of the access
        rights.
       FDP_ACC.1/TRM requires that the TSF shall enforce the Access Control SFP on terminals gaining
        access to the User data and data stored in EF.Sod of the logical travel document.. TSF_Access real-
        izes the appropriate control of the access rights.

       travel document) and Security attributes (PACE Authentication,Terminal Authentication v.1,Author-
       ization of the Terminal). FDP_ACF.1.2 requires that the TSF shall enforce the following rules to de-
       termine if an operation among con-trolled subjects and controlled objects is allowed: a BIS-PACE is
       allowed to read data objects from FDP_ACF.1.1/TRM according to [TR-03110] after a successful
       PACE authentication as required by FIA_UAU.1/PACE. FDP_ACF.1.3 requires that the TSF shall ex-
       plicitly authorize access of subjects to objects based on the following additional rules: none.
       FDP_ACF.1.4 requires that the TSF shall explicitly deny access of subjects to objects based on the
       rules: (1.) Any terminal being not authenticated as PACE authenticated BIS-PACE is not allowed to
       read, to write, to modify, to use any User Data stored on the travel document; (2) Terminals not
       using secure messaging are not allowed to read, to write, to modify, to use any data stored on the

7.1.8 TSF_OS: Javacard OS Security Functionalities
The Javacard operation system (part of the TOE) features the following Security Functionalities. The exact
description can be found in the Javacard OS security target [ST_OS]; the realization is partly based on the
security functionalities of the certified IC platform:
       Applet firewall (SF.Firewalll)
       Secure overwriting of data (SF.RIP)
       Atomicity and rollback mechanism for Global Platform management functions (SF.Rollback)
       Secure channel protocols (SF.SCP)
       Access control policy for Global Platform card management functions (SF.CM)
       Security measures against physical tampering and leakage (SF.Physical)
       Cryptographic services for applets (SF.CS)
       Secure PIN compare functions and integrity protection of the PIN (SF.PIN)

                       The IC hardware platform P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF is a microcontroller
                       incorporating a central processing unit, memories accessible via a Memory Management
                       Unit, cryptographic coprocessors, other security components and two communication
                       interfaces. The central processing unit supports a 32-/24-/16-/8-bit instruction set optimized
                       for smart card applications, which is a super set of the 80C51 family instruction set. The first
                       and in some cases the second byte of an instruction are used for operation encoding. On-
                       chip memories are ROM, RAM and EEPROM. The non-volatile EEPROM can be used as
                       data or program memory. It consists of high reliable memory cells, which guarantee data
                       integrity. The EEPROM is optimized for applications requiring reliable non-volatile data
                       storage for data and program code. EEPROM double read function is included for correct
                       memory readout. Dedicated security functionality protects the contents of all memories.
                       The security functionality of the TOE is designed to act as an integral part of a complete
                       security system in order to strengthen the design as a whole. Several security mechanisms
                       are completely implemented in and controlled by the TOE. Other security mechanisms allow
                       for configuration or even require handling of exceptions by the Security IC Embedded
                       Software. The different CPU modes and the Memory Management Unit support the
                       implementation of multi-application projects using the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF.
                       A Security IC must provide high security in particular when being used in the banking and
                       finance market, in electronic commerce or in governmental applications because the TOE
                       is intended to be used in a potential insecure environment. Hence the TOE shall maintain
                           • the integrity and the confidentiality of code and data stored in its memories and
                           • the different CPU modes with the related capabilities for configuration and memory
                             access and
                           • the integrity, the correct operation and the confidentiality of security functionality
                             provided by the TOE.
                       This is ensured by the construction of the TOE and its security functionality.
                       P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF basically provides a hardware platform for an
                       implementation of a smart card application with
                           • functionality to calculate the Data Encryption Standard (Triple-DES) with up to three
                             keys,
                           • functionality to calculate the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with different key
                             lengths,
                           • support for large integer arithmetic operations like multiplication, addition and logical
                             operations, which are suitable for public key cryptography and elliptic curve
                             cryptography,
                           • a True Random Number Generator,
                           • memory management control,
                           • cyclic redundancy check (CRC) calculation,
                           • ISO/IEC 7816 contact interface with UART,
                           • ISO/IEC 14443 A contactless interface.
                       In addition, several security mechanisms are implemented to ensure proper operation as
                       well as integrity and confidentiality of stored data. For example, this includes security
                       mechanisms for memory protection and security exceptions as well as sensors, which allow

                       and chip shielding is added to the chip.
                       Note:        Large integer arithmetic operations are intended to be used for calculation of
                                    asymmetric cryptographic algorithms. Any asymmetric cryptographic
                                    algorithm utilizing the support for large integer arithmetic operations has to be
                                    implemented in the Security IC Embedded Software. Thus, the support for
                                    large integer arithmetic operations itself does not provide security functionality
                                    like cryptographic support. The Security IC Embedded Software implementing
                                    an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm is not included in this evaluation.
                                    Nevertheless the support for large integer arithmetic operations is part of the
                                    Security IC and therefore a security relevant component of the TOE, that must

                       The TOE consists of the IC hardware platform and Security IC Dedicated Software as
                       composed of Security IC Dedicated Test Software and Security IC Dedicated Support
                       Software. The Security IC Dedicated Test Software contains the Test-ROM Software; the
                       Security IC Dedicated Support Software contains the Boot-ROM Software and the
                       Firmware Operating System.All other software is called Security IC Embedded Software.
                       The Security IC Embedded Software is not part of the TOE.
                       The IC Dedicated Support Software consists of Boot-ROM Software controlling the boot
                       process of the hardware platform and the Firmware Operating System which can be called
                       by the Security IC Embedded Software.
                       The Firmware Operating System for the hardware platform is called the Plain Firmware
                       Operating System (FOS-Plain) and the Firmware Operating System for the MIFARE
                       Software Emulation is called the Emulation Firmware Operating System (FOS- Emu).
                       The FOS-Plain provides an interface for programming of the internal EEPROM memory,
                       which is mandatory for use by the Security IC Embedded Software when programming the
                       EEPROM memory. Furthermore FOS-Plain provides an interface for the Post Delivery
                       Configuration functionality.
                       All configurations other than P60D024/016/012P include emulation MIFARE Plus
                       MF1PLUSx0 or MIFARE DESFire EV1 in the FOS-Emu. These emulations are represented
                       by the term MIFARE Software in this document. Note that MIFARE Software is not part of
                       the TOE (see Fig 2).

                              Release VB(Y) can be identified by ROM Code number xxx in the range of 005 to 013 and 092 to 095. All
                                 other ROM Code numbers are assigned to version VB(Z) and VB(A). The ROM code number can
                                 unambiguously identified by reading Security Row bytes RCN0 (DFFF8A) and RCN1 (DFF8B), see [9].
                                 In addition the ROM Code number is physically visible on the dice surface according to [12]. Releases
                                 VB(Z), and VB(A) share the same underlying hardware, but were adapted for yield improvement
                                 compared to VB(Y). Compared to Release VB(Z) the release VB(A) introduces additional configuration
                                 option. Releases VB(Z), and VB(A) can be distinguished by the Device Coding of “NXP option of
                                 PATDET configuration selection” in DC4 (“initial” for VB(Z), “a” for VB(A), see [9].

and against download of malicious software before, during and after the user downloads his software. This is
formalized with the objectives O.Cap_Avail_Loader, O.Authentication and O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader requiring
authentication of the TOE to external entities and a trusted communication channel. The O.Authentication
implements a mutual authentication and involves the environment therefore.
And the policies cover also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must be
regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.
The implemented mutual authentication requires first to authenticate the TOE to the external user. This requires
also knowledge by the user about the sequence of the protocol, interpretation of the transferred data and how to
start the authentication of the TOE. This authentication mean counters the threat T.Masquerade_TOE as only
the genuine TOE is able to identify itself correctly to the enabled user, which covers O.Authentication.
The second step of the mutual authentications mean implements the authentication of the user to the TOE. Only
the user enabled to present the correct authentication data and knowing about the sequence, data
interpretation and signaling of the authentication to the TOE is able to proceed further on.
This enforces OE.TOE_Auth, requiring the support of the verification mechanism and known authentication
reference data by the operational environment.

It is normal business that products enabled for software download by the user are either on their way to the user
or are already stored at user premises. At both situations it cannot be excluded that an attacker could manage to
steal such products enabled for software downloads. The ability to download software on a chip without
operating system and/or application is defined as open sample.
This situation generates the threat T.Open_Samples_Diffusion which is defined as follows:
The download of analysis software could enable an attacker to characterize the product and to construct an
attack path out of the gained information.
This threat is countered by the Flash Loader by following rational:
As long as the Flash Loader is active, controlled usage to the Flash Loader functionality (P.Ctrl_Loader) is
enforced which protects the TOE from achieving the status of being an open sample. And more, even the
attacker could observe, meaning in the sense of measurements during, or induce faults during an authorized
download, the Flash Loader protects the user data of the download by confidentiality and integrity protection
means. The Flash Loader functionalities of mutual authentication, establishing a dedicated trusted
