1.2        TOE Overview
The TOE consists of the Micro Controller and a software stack which is stored on the Micro Controller and which
can be executed by the Micro Controller. The software stack can be further split into the following components:

     • Firmware for booting and low level functionality of the Micro Controller, called MC FW.

     • Software for implementing cryptographic operations on the Micro Controller, called Security Software.

     • Software to update the JCOP or UpdaterOS, called OS Update Component.

     • Software to transfer personalization applet data from an old to a new version of an applet on applet update
       time, called Applet Migration.

     • Software that provides control on the Applet Migration and OS Update processes and ensures that only
       allowed OS updates can be performed in predefined states of the TOE. This software feature is called IM4.

     • Software for implementing the JCOP:

           – Software that implements low level functionality, called Native OS.
           – Software that implements the Java Card Virtual Machine [5] and a Java Card Runtime Environment [4],
             called JCVM and JCRE.
           – Software that implements the Java Card Application Programming Interface [3], called JCAPI.
           – Software for implementing content management according to GlobalPlatform [19], called GP.
           – Software that implements a proprietary programming interface, called Extension API.
           – Software that handles personalization and configuration, called Config Applet.

     • Software for implementing third party functionality, called Native Applications.

The TOE is JCOP which consists of the software stack without the Security Software and the MC FW. The TOE
uses one or more communication interfaces to communicate with its environment.
The complete TOE is depicted in Figure 1.1. The elements are described in more detail in Section 1.3.

   2. The second group of users are administrators of cards. They can configure the TOE by using the Config
      Applet or install additional applets. These users require the same equipment as end-users.

   3. The third group of users develops Java Card applets and executes them on the TOE. These applet devel-
      opers need in addition to the communication device a set of tools for the development of applets. This set of
      tools can be obtained from the TOE vendor and comprises elements such as PC development environment,
      byte code verifier, compiler, linker and debugger.

1.3.1.3.1.1   Applet Migration Component

The new Applet Migration feature allows to perform an applet update while preserving the personalization data.
From a functional perspective there are two logical APDUs commands that trigger the Applet Migration process:

     • an export APDU command containing a migration plan which identifies uniquely the package and the applet
       instance to export data and the respective new applet instance to import it. This identification is based on
       the packages’ and applets’ AIDs. As per the migration plan the applets are triggered to export their data.
       The packages, applets and instances are then deleted.

     • an import APDU command instructing the new applet instances to import the previously exported data.

The authenticity of the Applet Migration APDUs is always guaranteed:

     • either by including a signature and chained hash, similar to the APDUs used for OS update.

     • or by sending the APDUs over a Secure Channel protocol established with the ISD.

The main components of the Applet Migration feature are:

     • a predefined Java interface MigratableApplet to be implemented by applets so that those are enabled for
       applet data migration. The JCRE notifies the applet for the import/export events via this interface.

     • the ArchiveManager which is responsible to handle migrated data. The ArchiveManager receives and han-
       dles the migration plan from the Export APDU and ensures that the exported data can be imported by an
       applet with an AID as specified in the migration plan. The ArchiveManager allows setting and personalizing
       the SSD hierarchy during import or export phases.

The underlying mechanism of Applet Migration has the following steps:

     • the off card entity sends an export APDU commands over SCP or with a valid signature and chained hashes.
       The export APDU command is handled by the ArchiveManager which triggers the data export according to
       the migration plan conveyed in the export APDUs. ArchiveManager triggers applets whose AIDs are in the
       migration plan to export their respective personalization data. The exported data is stored in a data structure
       called data store. The packages, Applets and instances are deleted and removed from the registry.

     • the off card entity sends an import APDU. The ArchiveManager triggers the new applet instances identified
       by their AID to import the previously exported data as specified in the migration plan.

Applet Migration may be combined with the OS update process. In this use case scenario applet export and
import phases take place respectively before and after the OS update.

1.3.1.3.1.2    IM4 Feature

The new IM4 feature provides control over the Applet Migration and OS update processes. This control consists
in enforcing that

     • Applet Migration and OS update steps can be performed only in a particular state of the TOE.

     • only allowed OS update plans can be applied to the TOE.

No security claims are made for IM4. The use of IM4 does not compromise any of the security of the OS update
or the Applet Migration mechanisms and all restrictions implied by these mechanisms remain in force.
The IM4 implementation does not replace or modify the existing mechanisms by which the SE decrypts, authen-
ticates and authorizes JCOP updates. Rather, the purpose of IM4 is to facilitate a counter-signature scheme
designed to verify the customer authorization of the updates with minimum impact to the update implementation.


1.3.1.3.2     Native Applications

The Native Applications extend the available cryptographic algorithms for the Security Software. These Native
Applications are proprietary implementations (e.g. Felica) which make use of the Security Software’s security
mechanisms. Native Applications are provided to the JCOP via the Security Software. No security functionality
claimed for Native Applications, it is an extension to the Crypto Lib.


1.3.1.3.3     OS Update Component

The OS Update Component can update the JCOP and UpdaterOS and contains two main components:

     • OsSelector (no security claimed): After a hardware reset it provides the functionality to either boot Up-
       daterOS or JCOP. OsSelector also ensures that

           – only one OS is active (running) at a time.
           – at any time, at least one OS can be booted.
           – an invalid OS (e.g. partly flashed) can never be booted.

     • UpdaterOS:

           – it handles APDUs to write a new OS (either JCOP or UpdaterOS) to flash.
           – it verifies the integrity of the new OS before updating.
           – it decrypts the new OS before updating.
           – it checks if the new OS can be authenticated and checks if the update can be authorized.
           – it ensures that the activation and setting of the information that identifies the new OS is done atomically.
           – if the update fails the system stays in a secure state.

           The UpdaterOS is a standalone operating system that can only be active when JCOP is not active. Besides
           the capability to update JCOP, UpdaterOS is also capable of updating itself. The UpdaterOS version can
           be queried by using a SELECT OS Update AID Command (see relevant UGM). UpdaterOS shares parts of
           the Native OS with JCOP, e.g.: communication interface, wrapper to Security Software (Flash Services and
           CryptoLib).

                                                  Tab. 1.7: Life-cycle


The evaluation process is limited to phases 1 to 5. User Applet development is outside the scope of this evaluation.
Applets can be loaded into Flash memory. Applet loading into Flash memory can be done in phases 3, 4, 5, and
6. Applet loading in phase 7 is also allowed. This means post-issuance loading of applets can be done for a
certified TOE. The certification is only valid for platforms that return the Platform Identifier as stated in Table 1.8.
The delivery process from NXP to their customers (to phase 4 or phase 5 of the life cycle) guarantees, that the
customer is aware of the exact versions of the different parts of the TOE as outlined above. TOE documentation
is delivered in electronic form (encrypted according to defined mailing procedures).
Note: Phases 1 to 3 are under the TOE developer scope of control. Therefore, the objectives for the environment
related to phase 1 to 3 are covered by Assurance measures, which are materialized by documents, process and
procedures evaluated through the TOE evaluation process. During phases 4 to 7 the TOE is no more under the
developer control. In this environment, the TOE protects itself with its own Security functions. But some
additional usage recommendation must also be followed in order to ensure that the TOE is correctly and
securely handled, and that shall be not damaged or comprised.

Additionally to the Platform Identifier the TOE can also be identified by its sequence number:

   1. If UpdaterOS is active then the "SELECT OS Update AID" command will return the Current Sequence
      Number of UpdaterOS and the Reference Sequence Number.

   2. If JCOP is active then the "Get OS Info" command will return the Current Sequence Number of the JCOP
      (Final Sequence Number).

1.3.4      Evaluated Package Types
The TOE is delivered in a plastic package combined with a communication chip. All (enabled) pins of the TOE
are externally accessible. Any additional security provided by the plastic package is ignored for the security of the
TOE and therefore the package type is not security relevant. Common Criteria requirements for the acceptance
of this package type are detailed in [30].

2          Conformance Claims (ASE_CCL)
This chapter is divided into the following sections: "CC Conformance Claim", "Package Claim", "PP Claim", and
"Conformance Claim Rationale".


2.1 CC Conformance Claim
This Security Target claims to be conformant to version 3.1 of Common Criteria for Information Technology Secu-
rity Evaluation according to

     • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 1, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April
       2017" [9]

     • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 2, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April
       2017" [10]

     • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 3, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April
       2017" [11]

The following methodology will be used for the evaluation:

     • Common Methodology for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Evaluation Methodology, Version
       3.1, Revision 5" [12]

This Security Target claims to be CC Part 2 extended and CC Part 3 conformant. The extended Security Func-
tional Requirements are defined in Chapter 6.


2.2        Package Claim
This Security Target claims conformance to the assurance package EAL5 augmented. The augmentation to
EAL5 is AVA_VAN.5 “Advanced methodical vulnerability analysis”, ASE_TSS.2 “TOE summary specification with
architectural design summary”, ALC_DVS.2 “Sufficiency of security measures” and ALC_FLR.1 “Basic flaw reme-
diation”.


2.3        PP Claim
The Security Target claims demonstrable conformance to the Java Card Protection Profile - Open Configuration,
Version 3.0, Certified by ANSSI, the French Certification Body May, 2012 [2]. The Java Card Protection Profile
makes the use of Java Card RMI and "Management of External Memory (EXT-MEM)" from the group EMG op-
tional. The TOE does not support Java Card RMI and "Management of External Memory (EXT-MEM)" from the
group EMG. This ST is more restrictive than the PP [2] which chapter 2.4 provides a rationale for.

The SPD statement that is presented in Chapter 4 includes the threats as presented in the PP [2], but also includes
additional threats. These threats are:

     • T.RND

     • T.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE.LOAD

     • T.INTEG-UPDATE-IMAGE.LOAD

     • T.UNAUTH-LOAD-UPDATE-IMAGE

     • T.INTERRUPT-OSU

     • T.CONFIG

The threat T.RND is taken from the Security IC PP [13].
The threats T.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE.LOAD, T.INTEG-UPDATE-IMAGE.LOAD, T.UNAUTH-LOAD-UPDATE-IMAGE
and T.INTERRUPT-OSU are included for the OS Update which is additional functionality the PP allows.
The threat T.CONFIG is an additional threat to cover unauthorized modifications and read access of the configu-
ration area in the TOE. It is an addition to the threats defined in the PP [2]. The threat T.ATTACK-COUNTER is

included for the Restricted Mode which is additional functionality the PP allows. The threat T.COM_EXPLOIT is
included to cover communication channels attacks and it is an addition to the threats in the PP [2].
The threat T.LIFE_CYCLE is included to cover content management attacks and it is an addition to the threats in
the PP [2].
The threat T.UNAUTHORIZED_CARD_MNGT refines the threats T.INSTALL and T.DELETION from the PP [2].
The threat T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA[REFINED] refines the threat T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA in the PP [2].
The threat T.AM_DATASTORE_ACCESS is included for Applet Migration which is additional functionality the PP
allows. Note that the threat T.EXE-CODE-REMOTE is not included, since the TOE does not support Java Card
RMI. The Java Card Protection Profile [2] makes the use of Java Card RMI optional.
The SPD statement presented in Chapter 4, copies the OSP from the PP [2], and adds the following additional
OSPs:

     • OSP.PROCESS-TOE

     • OSP.KEY-CHANGE

     • OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS

The OSP OSP.PROCESS-TOE is introduced for the pre-personalisation feature of the TOE and is an addition to
the OSPs in PP [2]. The OSP OSP.KEY-CHANGE is introduced for the SD feature of the TOE and is an addition
to the OSPs in PP [2]. The OSP OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS is introduced for the SD feature of the TOE and is an
addition to the OSPs in PP [2].
The SPD statement includes two of the three assumptions from the PP [2]. The assumption A.Deletion is ex-
cluded. The Card Manager is part of the TOE and therefore the assumption is no longer relevant. Leaving out the
assumption, makes the SPD of this ST more restrictive than the SPD in the PP [2]. As the Card Manager is part
of the TOE, it is ensuring that the deletion of applets through the Card Manager is secure, instead of assuming
that it is handled by the Card Manager in the environment of the TOE.
Besides the assumptions from the PP [2], five additional assumptions are added:

     • A.PROCESS-SEC-IC

     • A.USE_DIAG

     • A.USE_KEYS

     • A.APPS-PROVIDER

     • A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY

The assumption A.PROCESS-SEC-IC is taken from the underlying certified Micro Controller [43], which is com-
pliant to the Security IC PP [13].
The assumptions A.USE_DIAG and A.USE_KEYS are included because the Card Manager is part of the TOE
and no longer part of the environment.

The assumptions A.APPS-PROVIDER and A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY are added because Security Domains
from the GlobalPlatform Specification are introduced. All the applets and packages are signed by the APSD and
the correctness is verified on the TOE by VASD before the package or applet is installed or loaded. A.APPS-
PROVIDER and A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY are additions to PP [2] for card content management environ-
ment.

2.4.3      Security Objectives Statement
The statement of security objectives in the ST presented in Chapter 5 includes all security objectives as presented
in the PP [2], but also includes a number of additional security objectives. These security objectives are:

     • OT.IDENTIFICATION

     • OT.RND

     • OT.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE.LOAD

     • OT.AUTH-LOAD-UPDATE-IMAGE

     • OT.SECURE_LOAD_ACODE

     • OT.SECURE_AC_ACTIVATION

     • OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION

     • OT.CARD-CONFIGURATION

     • OT.ATTACK-COUNTER

     • OT.RESTRICTED-MODE

     • OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS

     • OT.APPLI-AUTH

     • OT.COMM_AUTH

     • OT.COMM_INTEGRITY

     • OT.COMM_CONFIDENTIALITY

     • OT.DATASTORE_ACCESS

The security objectives OT.IDENTIFICATION, OT.RND are part of the security objectives of the certified Micro
Controller [43](see also Section 1.3.1.1) and Security Software [44](see also Section 1.3.1.2.2), which are also
components of this composite certification. Therefore the security objective statement is equivalent to the PP[2]

for these two security objectives. OT.IDENTIFICATION is also included for the pre-personalisation feature of the
TOE, which is additional functionality the PP allows.
The security objective OT.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE.LOAD, OT.AUTH-LOAD-UPDATE-IMAGE, OT.SECURE_LOAD_
ACODE, OT.SECURE_AC_ACTIVATION, OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION are included for the OS Update which is ad-
ditional functionality the PP allows. The security objectives OT.CARD-CONFIGURATION is included for the Con-
fig Applet which is additional functionality the PP allows. The security objectives OT.ATTACK-COUNTER and
OT.RESTRICTED-MODE are included for the restricted mode which is additional functionality the PP allows. The
security objectives OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS, OT.APPLI-AUTH, OT.COMM_AUTH, OT.COMM_INTEGRITY, OT.COMM_
CONFIDENTIALITY are objectives for the TOE as the GlobalPlatform API and the definitions for Secure Channel,
Security Domains and Card Content Management are used from it.
The ST contains OE.APPLET, OE.VERIFICATION and OE.CODE-EVIDENCE from Security Objectives for the
Operational Environment from [2]. Additionally, some of the Security Objectives for the Operational Environment
from [2] are listed as TOE Security Objectives in this ST:

     • OT.SCP.RECOVERY instead of OE.SCP.RECOVERY

     • OT.SCP.SUPPORT instead of OE.SCP.SUPPORT

     • OT.SCP.IC instead of OE.SCP.IC

     • OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT instead of OE.CARD-MANAGEMENT

OT.SCP.RECOVERY, OT.SCP.SUPPORT, and OT.SCP.IC are objectives for the TOE as the Smart Card Platform
belongs to the TOE for this evaluation. OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT is an objective for the TOE as the Card Manager
belongs to the TOE for this evaluation. Moving objectives from the environment to the TOE, adds objectives to
the TOE without changing the overall objectives. The statement of security objectives is therefore equivalent to
the security objectives in the PP [2] to which conformance is claimed. The security objective OT.DATASTORE_
ACCESS addresses the need for access control policy to be enforced for the Applet Migration feature.
The security objectives O.INSTALL, O.LOAD, and O.DELETION from the PP [2] are not included since these
functionality and objectives are covered by the refined OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT.
Note that the objective O.REMOTE is not included, since the TOE does not support Java Card RMI. The Java
Card Protection Profile makes the use of Java Card RMI optional.
Note that the objective O.EXT-MEM is not included, since the TOE does not support "Management of External
Memory (EXT-MEM)". The Java Card Protection Profile makes the use of "Management of External Memory
(EXT-MEM)" optional.
A part of the security objectives for the environment defined in the PP [2] has been included in this ST. The other
part of security objectives for the environment, which is present in the PP [2], is used as part of the security
objectives for the TOE in this ST. The ST also introduces eight additional security objectives for the environment.
The additional objectives for the environment are:

     • OE.USE_DIAG

     • OE.APPS-PROVIDER

     • OE.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY

     • OE.KEY-CHANGE

     • OE.SECURITY-DOMAINS

The security objective for the environment OE.PROCESS_SEC_IC is from the hardware platform (Micro Controller
[43]see also Section 1.3.1.1) that is part of this composite product evaluation. Therefore the statement of security
objectives for the environment is equivalent to the statement in the Security IC PP [13].
OE.USE_KEYS and OE.USE_DIAG are included because the Card Manager is part of the TOE and not a security
objective for the environment as in PP [2].
The security objective for the environment OE.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE.CREATE is to cover the
confidentiality during creation and transmission phase of D.UPDATE_IMAGE and therefore partly covers the
threats introduced by the update mechanism which is additional functionality.
OE.APPS-PROVIDER and OE.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY cover trusted actors which enable the creation, dis-
tribution and verification of secure applications. OE.KEY-CHANGE covers the switch to trusted keys for the AP.
OE.SECURITY-DOMAINS covers the management of security domains in the context of the GlobalPlatform Spec-
ification.
The statement of security objectives for the environment is therefore considered to be equivalent to the security
objectives in the PP [2] to which conformance is claimed.

2.4.4      Security Functional Requirements Statement
The Security Functional Requirements Statement copies most SFRs as defined in the PP [2], with the exception
of a number of options. For the copied set of SFRs the ST is considered equivalent to the statement of SFRs
in the PP [2]. Moreover as requested by the PP [2] the ST adds additional threats, objectives and SFRs to fully
cover and describe additional security functionality implemented in the TOE.
The TOE restricts remote access from the CAD to the services implemented by the applets on the card to
none, and as a result the SFRs concerning Java Card RMI (FDP_ACF.1[JCRMI], SFRs FDP_IFC.1/JCRMI, FDP_
IFF.1/JCRMI, FMT_MSA.1/EXPORT, FMT_MSA.1/REM_REFS, FMT_MSA.3/JCRMI, FMT_SMF.1/JCRMI, FMT_
REV.1/JCRMI, and FMT_SMR.1/JCRMI) are not included in the ST. In the PP [2] the use of the Java Card RMI is
optional. The TOE does not implement Java Card RMI.
The TOE does not allow external memory access to the services implemented by the applets on the card,
and as a result the SFRs concerning "Management of External Memory (EXT-MEM)" (FDP_ACC.1/EXT_MEM,

FDP_ACF.1/EXT_MEM, FMT_MSA.1/EXT_MEM, FMT_MSA.3/EXT_MEM and FMT_SMF.1/EXT_MEM) are not
included in the ST. In the PP [2] the use of the "Management of External Memory (EXT-MEM)" is optional. The
TOE does not implement "Management of External Memory (EXT-MEM)".
The SFR FDP_ITC.2/INSTALLER from the PP [2] is replaced by FDP_ITC.2[CCM] which enforces the Firewall
access control policy and the Secure Channel Protocol information flow policy and which is more restrictive than
the PACKAGE LOADING information flow control SFP from PP [2].
The set of SFRs that define the card content management mechanism CarG are partly replaced or refined and
are considered to be equivalent or more restrictive because of the newly introduced SFPs:

   1. Security Domain access control policy

   2. Secure Channel Protocol information flow policy

These SFPs provide a concrete and more restrictive implementation of the PACKAGE LOADING information flow
control SFP from PP [2] by following the information flow policy defined by Global Platform specifications.
The table below lists the SFRs from CarG of PP [2] and their corresponding refinements in this ST.

Functional Requirements Statement more restrictive than the PP [2]:
FDP_ROL.1[CCM] and FPT_FLS.1[CCM] realize additional security functionality for the card manager which is
allowed by the PP [2].
The set of SFRs that define the security domains mechanism as specified by GlobalPlatform, realize refinements

3          Security Aspects
This chapter describes the main security issues of the Java Card System and its environment addressed in this
ST, called "security aspects", in a CC-independent way. In addition to this, the security aspects also give a semi-
formal framework to express the CC security environment and objectives of the TOE. They can be instantiated
as assumptions, threats, objectives (for the TOE and the environment) or organizational security policies. The

3.1        Confidentiality
SA.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE               Confidentiality of Update Image
                                     The update image must be kept confidential. This concerns the non disclosure of
                                     the update image in transit to the card.

SA.CONFID-APPLI-DATA                 Confidentiality of Application Data
                                     Application data must be protected against unauthorized disclosure. This con-
                                     cerns logical attacks at runtime in order to gain read access to other application’s
                                     data.

SA.CONFID-JCS-CODE                   Confidentiality of Java Card System Code
                                     Java Card System code must be protected against unauthorized disclosure. Knowl-
                                     edge of the Java Card System code may allow bypassing the TSF. This concerns
                                     logical attacks at runtime in order to gain a read access to executable code, typi-
                                     cally by executing an application that tries to read the memory area where a piece
                                     of Java Card System code is stored.

SA.CONFID-JCS-DATA                   Confidentiality of Java Card System Data
                                     Java Card System data must be protected against unauthorized disclosure. This
                                     concerns logical attacks at runtime in order to gain a read access to Java Card
                                     System data. Java Card System data includes the data managed by the Java Card
                                     RE, the Java Card VM and the internal data of Java Card platform API classes as

                                                      memory area as if it was executable code. Note that execute access to
                                                      native code of the Java Card System and applications is the concern of
                                                      SA.NATIVE.

SA.FIREWALL                                     Firewall
                                                The Firewall shall ensure controlled sharing of class instances1 , and isolation of
                                                their data and code between packages (that is, controlled execution contexts)
                                                as well as between packages and the JCRE context. An applet shall not read,
                                                write, compare a piece of data belonging to an applet that is not in the same
                                                context, or execute one of the methods of an applet in another context without its
                                                authorization.

SA.NATIVE                                       Native Code Execution
                                                Because the execution of native code is outside of the JCS TSF scope, it must
                                                be secured so as to not provide ways to bypass the TSFs of the JCS. Loading
                                                of native code, which is as well outside those TSFs, is submitted to the same
                                                requirements. Should native software be privileged in this respect, exceptions to
                                                the policies must include a rationale for the new security framework they introduce.


3.4          Bytecode Verification
SA.VERIFICATION                                 Bytecode Verification
                                                Bytecode must be verified prior to being executed. Bytecode verification includes:

                                                   1. how well-formed CAP file is and the verification of the typing constraints on
                                                      the bytecode,
                                                   2. binary compatibility with installed CAP files and the assurance that the ex-
                                                      port files used to check the CAP file correspond to those that will be present
                                                      on the card when loading occurs.


3.5          Card Management
SA.CARD-MANAGEMENT                              Card Management


                                                   1. The card manager (CM) shall control the access to card management func-
                                                      tions such as the installation, update or deletion of applets.
                                                   2. The card manager shall implement the card issuer’s policy on the card.

                              1. The TOE must be able to return to a safe and consistent state when the
                                 installation of a package or an applet fails or be cancelled (whatever the
                                 reasons).
                              2. Installing an applet must have no effect on the code and data of already
                                 installed applets. The installation procedure should not be used to bypass
                                 the TSFs. In short, it is an atomic operation, free of harmful effects on the
                                 state of the other applets.
                              3. The procedure of loading and installing a package shall ensure its integrity
                                 and authenticity.

SA.SID                      Subject Identification


                              1. Users and subjects of the TOE must be identified.
                              2. The identity of sensitive users and subjects associated with administrative
                                 and privileged roles must be particularly protected; this concerns the Java
                                 Card RE, the applets registered on the card, and especially the default applet
                                 and the currently selected applet (and all other active applets in Java Card
                                 System). A change of identity, especially standing for an administrative role
                                 (like an applet impersonating the Java Card RE), is a severe violation of the
                                 SFR. Selection controls the access to any data exchange between the TOE
                                 and the CAD and therefore, must be protected as well. The loading of a
                                 package or any exchange of data through the APDU buffer (which can be
                                 accessed by any applet) can lead to disclosure of keys, application code or
                                 data, and so on.

SA.OBJ-DELETION             Object Deletion


                              1. Deallocation of objects should not introduce security holes in the form of
                                 references pointing to memory zones that are not longer in use, or have
                                 been reused for other purposes. Deletion of collection of objects should not
                                 be maliciously used to circumvent the TSFs.
                              2. Erasure, if deemed successful, shall ensure that the deleted class instance
                                 is no longer accessible.

SA.DELETION                 Deletion


                              1. Deletion of installed applets (or packages) should not introduce security
                                 holes in the form of broken references to garbage collected code or data,
                                 nor should they alter integrity or confidentiality of remaining applets. The
                                 deletion procedure should not be maliciously used to bypass the TSFs.

                              2. Erasure, if deemed successful, shall ensure that any data owned by the
                                 deleted applet is no longer accessible (shared objects shall either prevent
                                 deletion or be made inaccessible). A deleted applet cannot be selected or
                                 receive APDU commands. Package deletion shall make the code of the
                                 package no longer available for execution.
                              3. Power failure or other failures during the process shall be taken into account
                                 in the implementation so as to preserve the SFRs. This does not mandate,
                                 however, the process to be atomic. For instance, an interrupted deletion may
                                 result in the loss of user data, as long as it does not violate the SFRs.

                            The deletion procedure and its characteristics (whether deletion is either physi-
                            cal or logical, what happens if the deleted application was the default applet, the
                            order to be observed on the deletion steps) are implementation-dependent. The
                            only commitment is that deletion shall not jeopardize the TOE (or its assets) in
                            case of failure (such as power shortage).
                            Deletion of a single applet instance and deletion of a whole package are func-
                            tionally different operations and may obey different security rules. For instance,
                            specific packages can be declared to be undeletable (for instance, the Java Card
                            API packages), or the dependency between installed packages may forbid the
                            deletion (like a package using super classes or super interfaces declared in an-
                            other package).


3.6        Services
SA.ALARM                    Alarm
                            The TOE shall provide appropriate feedback upon detection of a potential security
                            violation. This particularly concerns the type errors detected by the bytecode
                            verifier, the security exceptions thrown by the Java Card VM, or any other security-
                            related event occurring during the execution of a TSF.

SA.OPERATE                  Operate


                              1. The TOE must ensure continued correct operation of its security functions.
                              2. In case of failure during its operation, the TOE must also return to a well-
                                 defined valid state before the next service request.

SA.RESOURCES                Resources
                            The TOE controls the availability of resources for the applications and enforces
                            quotas and limitations in order to prevent unauthorized denial of service or mal-
                            function of the TSFs. This concerns both execution (dynamic memory allocation)
                            and installation (static memory allocation) of applications and packages.

SA.CIPHER                   Cipher
                            The TOE shall provide a means to the applications for ciphering sensitive data,
                            for instance, through a programming interface to low-level, highly secure crypto-
                            graphic services. In particular, those services must support cryptographic algo-
                            rithms consistent with cryptographic usage policies and standards.

SA.KEY-MNGT                 Key Management
                            The TOE shall provide a means to securely manage cryptographic keys. This
                            includes:

                              1. Keys shall be generated in accordance with specified cryptographic key gen-
                                 eration algorithms and specified cryptographic key sizes,
                              2. Keys must be distributed in accordance with specified cryptographic key dis-
                                 tribution methods,
                              3. Keys must be initialized before being used,
                              4. Keys shall be destroyed in accordance with specified cryptographic key de-
                                 struction methods.

SA.PIN-MNGT                 PIN Management
                            The TOE shall provide a means to securely manage PIN objects. This includes:

                              1. Atomic update of PIN value and try counter,
                              2. No rollback on the PIN-checking function,
                              3. Keeping the PIN value (once initialized) secret (for instance, no clear-PIN-
                                 reading function),
                              4. Enhanced protection of PIN’s security attributes (state, try counter ...) in
                                 confidentiality and integrity.

SA.SCP                      Smart Card Platform
                            The smart card platform must be secure with respect to the SFRs. Then:

                              1. After a power loss, RF signal loss or sudden card removal prior to completion
                                 of some communication protocol, the SCP will allow the TOE on the next
                                 power up to either complete the interrupted operation or revert to a secure
                                 state.
                              2. It does not allow the SFRs to be bypassed or altered and does not allow
                                 access to other low-level functions than those made available by the pack-
                                 ages of the Java Card API. That includes the protection of its private data
                                 and code (against disclosure or modification) from the Java Card System.
                              3. It provides secure low-level cryptographic processing to the Java Card Sys-

                               4. It supports the needs for any update to a single persistent object or class
                                  field to be atomic, and possibly a low-level transaction mechanism.
                               5. It allows the Java Card System to store data in a ”persistent technology
                                  memory” or in volatile memory, depending on its needs (for instance, tran-
                                  sient objects must not be stored in non-volatile memory). The memory
                                  model is structured and allows for low-level control accesses (segmentation
                                  fault detection).
                               6. It safely transmits low-level exceptions to the TOE (arithmetic exceptions,
                                  checksum errors), when applicable.
                               7. Finally, it is required that the IC is designed in accordance with a well-defined
                                  set of policies and standards (for instance, those specified in [13]), and will
                                  be tamper resistant to actually prevent an attacker from extracting or altering
                                  security data (like cryptographic keys) by using commonly employed tech-
                                  niques (physical probing and sophisticated analysis of the chip). This espe-
                                  cially matters to the management (storage and operation) of cryptographic
                                  keys.

SA.TRANSACTION               Transaction
                             The TOE must provide a means to execute a set of operations atomically. This
                             mechanism must not jeopardise the execution of the user applications. The trans-
                             action status at the beginning of an applet session must be closed (no pending
                             updates).

SA.CONFIG-APPLET             Config Applet
                             The Config Applet is a JCOP functionality which allows to:

                               1. Read and modify configuration items in the configuration area of the TOE,
                               2. Disable Access to configuration item.


3.8        OS Update
SA.OSU                       OS Update
                             The UpdaterOS allows to update JCOP OS and the UpdaterOS itself. It ensures
                             that only valid updates can be installed on the TOE.

4          Security Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)
4.1        Assets
Assets are security-relevant elements to be directly protected by the TOE. Confidentiality of assets is always
intended with respect to un-trusted people or software, as various parties are involved during the first stages of
the smart card product life-cycle. Details concerning the threats are given in Section 4.2 hereafter.
Assets have to be protected, some in terms of confidentiality and some in terms of integrity or both integrity and
confidentiality. These assets might get compromised by the threats that the TOE is exposed to.
The assets to be protected by the TOE are listed below. They are grouped according to whether it is data created
by and for the user (User data) or data created by and for the TOE (TSF data). This definition of grouping is taken
from Section 5.1 of [2].

                                     of the currently executed method, or a position of the operand
                                     stack. To be protected from unauthorized disclosure.
             D.APP_I_DATA            Integrity sensitive data of the applications, like the data contained
                                     in an object, a static field of a package, a local variable of the

                                     be protected from unauthorized modification.
             D.APP_KEYS              Cryptographic keys owned by the applets. To be protected from
                                     unauthorized disclosure and modification.
             D.PIN                   Any end-user’s PIN. To be protected from unauthorized disclo-
                                     sure and modification.

T.COM_EXPLOIT               Communication Channel Remote Exploit
                            An attacker remotely exploits the communication channels established between a
                            third party and the TOE in order to modify or disclose confidential data.
                            All assets are threatened.

T.OBJ-DELETION              Object Deletion
                            The attacker keeps a reference to a garbage collected object in order to force the
                            TOE to execute an unavailable method, to make it to crash, or to gain access to
                            a memory containing data that is now being used by another application. See

4.2.8      Miscellaneous
T.PHYSICAL                  Physical Tampering
                            The attacker discloses or modifies the design of the TOE, its sensitive data or
                            application code by physical (opposed to logical) tampering means. This threat
                            includes IC failure analysis, electrical probing, unexpected tearing, and DPA. That
                            also includes the modification of the runtime execution of Java Card System or
                            SCP software through alteration of the intended execution order of (set of) in-
                            structions through physical tampering techniques. This threatens all the identified
                            assets. This threat refers to the point (7) of the security aspect SA.SCP, and all
                            aspects related to confidentiality and integrity of code and data.


4.2.9      Random Numbers
T.RND                       Deficiency of Random Numbers
                            An attacker may predict or obtain information about random numbers generated
                            by the TOE for instance because of a lack of entropy of the random numbers pro-
                            vided. An attacker may gather information about the produced random numbers
                            which might be a problem because they may be used for instance to generate
                            cryptographic keys. Here the attacker is expected to take advantage of statis-
                            tical properties of the random numbers generated by the TOE without specific
                            knowledge about the TOE’s generator. Malfunctions or premature ageing are also
                            considered which may assist in getting information about random numbers.

4.3        Organisational Security Policies
OSP.VERIFICATION                 File Verification
                                 This policy shall ensure the consistency between the export files used in the
                                 verification and those used for installing the verified file. The policy must also
                                 ensure that no modification of the file is performed in between its verification
                                 and the signing by the verification authority. See SA.VERIFICATION for details.
                                 If the application development guidance provided by the platform developer
                                 contains recommendations related to the isolation property of the platform, this
                                 policy shall also ensure that the verification authority checks that these
                                 recommendations are applied in the application code
                                 Identification of the TOE
OSP.PROCESS-TOE
                                 An accurate identification must be established for the TOE. This requires that each
                                 instantiation of the TOE carries this identification.

                                 Security Domain Keys Change
OSP.KEY-CHANGE
                                 The AP shall change its initial security domain keys (APSD) before any operation
                                 on its Security Domain.

                                 Security Domains
OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS
                                 Security domains can be dynamically created, deleted and blocked during usage
                                 phase in post-issuance mode.



4.4        Assumptions
Note that the assumption A.DELETION is excluded. The Card Manager is part of the TOE and therefore the
assumption is no longer relevant.
A.APPLET                         Applets without Native Methods
                                 Applets loaded post-issuance do not contain native methods. The Java Card spec-
                                 ification explicitly ”does not include support for native methods” ([5]) outside the
                                 API.

A.VERIFICATION                   Bytecode Verification
                                 All the bytecodes are verified at least once, before the loading, before the installa-
                                 tion or before the execution, depending on the card capabilities, in order to ensure
                                 that each bytecode is valid at execution time.

A.USE_DIAG                       Usage of TOE’s Secure Communication Protocol by OE
                                 It is assumed that the operational environment supports and uses the secure com-
                                 munication protocols offered by the TOE.

A.USE_KEYS                  Protected Storage of Keys Outside of TOE
                            It is assumed that the keys which are stored outside the TOE and which are used
                            for secure communication and authentication between Smart Card and terminals
                            are protected for confidentiality and integrity in their own storage environment.
                            This is especially true for D.APSD_KEYS, D.ISD_KEYS, and D.VASD_KEYS.
                            Info: This is to assume that the keys used in terminals or systems are correctly
                            protected for confidentiality and integrity in their own environment, as the disclo-
                            sure of such information which is shared with the TOE but is not under the TOE
                            control, may compromise the security of the TOE.

A.PROCESS-SEC-IC            Protection during Packaging, Finishing and Personalisation
                            It is assumed that security procedures are used after delivery of the TOE by the
                            TOE Manufacturer up to delivery to the end consumer to maintain confidentiality
                            and integrity of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test data (to prevent any
                            possible copy, modification, retention, theft or unauthorised use). This means
                            that the Phases after TOE Delivery are assumed to be protected appropriately.
                            The assets to be protected are: The information and material produced and/or
                            processed by the Security IC Embedded Software Developer in Phase 1 and by
                            the Composite Product Manufacturer can be grouped as follows:

                              1. the Security IC Embedded Software including specifications, implementation
                                 and related documentation,
                              2. pre-personalisation and personalisation data including specifications of for-
                                 mats and memory areas, test related data,
                              3. the User Data and related documentation, and
                              4. material for software development support

                            as long as they are not under the control of the TOE Manufacturer.

A.APPS-PROVIDER             Application Provider
                            The AP is a trusted actor that provides basic or secure applications. He is respon-
                            sible for his security domain keys (D.APSD_KEYS).
                            Info: An AP generally refers to the entity that issues the application. For instance it
                            can be a financial institution for a payment application such as EMV or a transport
                            operator for a transport application.

A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY    Verification Authority
                            The VA is a trusted actor who is able to verify bytecode of an application loaded on
                            the card, guarantee and generate the digital signature attached to an application
                            and ensure that its public key for verifying the application signature is on the TOE.
                            Info: As a consequence, it guarantees the success of the application validation
                            upon loading.

5          Security Objectives
5.1        Security Objectives for the TOE
5.1.1       Identification
OT.SID                       Subject Identification
                             The TOE shall uniquely identify every subject (applet, or package) before granting it
                             access to any service.


5.1.2       Execution
OT.FIREWALL                  Firewall
                             The TOE shall ensure controlled sharing of data containers owned by applets of dif-
                             ferent packages or the JCRE and between applets and the TSFs. See SA.FIREWALL
                             for details.

OT.GLOBAL_ARRAYS_CONFID      Confidentiality of Global Arrays
                             The TOE shall ensure that the APDU buffer that is shared by all applications is always
                             cleaned upon applet selection. The TOE shall ensure that the global byte array used
                             for the invocation of the install method of the selected applet is always cleaned after
                             the return from the install method.

OT.GLOBAL_ARRAYS_INTEG       Integrity of Global Arrays
                             The TOE shall ensure that only the currently selected applications may have a write
                             access to the APDU buffer and the global byte array used for the invocation of the
                             install method of the selected applet.

OT.NATIVE                    Native Code
                             The only means that the Java Card VM shall provide for an application to execute
                             native code is the invocation of a method of the Java Card API, or any additional API.
                             See SA.NATIVE for details.

OT.OPERATE                   Correct Operation
                             The TOE must ensure continued correct operation of its security functions. See
                             SA.OPERATE for details.

OT.REALLOCATION              Secure Re-Allocation
                             The TOE shall ensure that the re-allocation of a memory block for the runtime areas
                             of the Java Card VM does not disclose any information that was previously stored in
                             that block.

OT.RESOURCES                 Resources availability
                             The TOE shall control the availability of resources for the applications. See SA.RESOURCES
                             for details.

                             The TOE shall provide a means to securely manage PIN objects. See SA.PIN-MNGT
                             for details.
                             AppNote: PIN objects may play key roles in the security architecture of client applica-
                             tions. The way they are stored and managed in the memory of the smart card must
                             be carefully considered, and this applies to the whole object rather than the sole value
                             of the PIN.

OT.TRANSACTION               Transaction
                             The TOE must provide a means to execute a set of operations atomically. See
                             SA.TRANSACTION for details.


5.1.4      Object Deletion
OT.OBJ-DELETION              Object Deletion
                             The TOE shall ensure the object deletion shall not break references to objects. See
                             SA.OBJ-DELETION for further details.


5.1.5      Applet Management
OT.APPLI-AUTH                Application Authentication
                             The card manager shall enforce the application security policies established by the
                             card issuer by requiring application authentication during application loading on the
                             card. This security objective is a refinement of the Security Objective O.LOAD from
                             [2].

                             will guarantee that the security policies established by the card issuer on applications
                             are enforced. For example this authority (DAP) or a third party (Mandated DAP) can

OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS             Domain Rights
                             The Card issuer shall not get access or change personalized AP Security Domain
                             keys which belong to the AP. Modification of a Security Domain keyset is restricted to
                             the AP who owns the security domain.
                             AppNote: APs have a set of keys that allows them to establish a secure channel be-
                             tween them and the platform. These keys sets are not known by the TOE issuer. The
                             security domain initial keys are changed before any operation on the SD (OE.KEY-
                             CHANGE).

OT.COMM_AUTH                 Communication Mutual Authentication
                             The TOE shall authenticate the origin of the card management requests that the card
                             receives, and authenticate itself to the remote actor.

OT.COMM_INTEGRITY            Communication Request Integrity
                             The TOE shall verify the integrity of the card management requests that the card
                             receives.

OT.COMM_CONFIDENTIALITY      Communication Request Confidentiality
                             The TOE shall be able to process card management requests containing encrypted
                             data.


5.1.6      Card Management
OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT           Card Management
                             The TOE shall provide card management functionalities (loading, installation, extradi-
                             tion, deletion of applications and GP registry updates) in charge of the life cycle of the
                             whole device and installed applications (applets). The card manager, the application
                             with specific rights responsible for the administration of the smart card, shall control
                             the access to card management functions. It shall also implement the card issuer’s
                             policy on card management.
                             The Security Objective from [2] for the environment OE.CARD-MANAGEMENT is
                             listed as TOE Security Objective OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT for the TOE as the Card
                             Manager belongs to the TOE for this evaluation. This security objective is a refine-
                             ment for the Security Objectives O.INSTALL, O.LOAD, and O.DELETION from [2].
                             Thus, the following objectives are also covered:

                                • The TOE shall ensure that the installation of an applet performs as expected
                                     (See SA.INSTALL for details).
                                • The TOE shall ensure that the loading of a package into the card is secure.
                                • The TOE shall ensure that the deletion of a package from the TOE is secure.

                            AppNote: The card manager will be tightly connected in practice with the rest of
                            the TOE, which in return shall very likely rely on the card manager for the effective
                            enforcement of some of its security functions. The mechanism used to ensure au-
                            thentication of the TOE issuer, that manages the TOE, or of the Service Providers
                            owning a Security Domain with card management privileges is a secure channel.
                            This channel will be used afterwards to protect commands exchanged with the TOE
                            in confidentiality and integrity. The platform guarantees that only the ISD or the Ser-
                            vice Providers owning a Security Domain with the appropriate privilege (Delegated
                            Management) can manage the applications on the card associated with its Security
                            Domain. This is done accordingly with the card issuer’s policy on card management.
                            The actor performing the operation must beforehand authenticate with the Security
                            Domain. In the case of Delegated Management, the card management command will
                            be associated with an electronic signature (GlobalPlatform token) verified by the ISD
                            before execution.
                            The Security Objective from [2] for the environment OE.CARD-MANAGEMENT is
                            listed as TOE Security Objective OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT for the TOE as the Card
                            Manager belongs to the TOE for this evaluation. This security objective is a refine-
                            ment for the Security Objectives O.INSTALL, O.LOAD, and O.DELETION from [2].
                            Thus, the following AppNote applicable to O.DELETION applies also:

                                 • Usurpation of identity resulting from a malicious installation of an applet on the
                                   card may also be the result of perturbing the communication channel linking
                                   the CAD and the card. Even if the CAD is placed in a secure environment,
                                   the attacker may try to capture, duplicate, permute or modify the packages sent
                                   to the card. He may also try to send one of its own applications as if it came
                                   from the card issuer. Thus, this objective is intended to ensure the integrity and
                                   authenticity of loaded CAP files.

OT.IDENTIFICATION                TOE identification
                                 The TOE must provide means to store Initialization Data and Pre-personalization Data
                                 in its non-volatile memory. The Initialization Data (or parts of them) are used for TOE

                                 The TOE will ensure the cryptographic quality of random number generation. For
                                 instance random numbers shall not be predictable and shall have sufficient entropy.
                                 The TOE will ensure that no information about the produced random numbers is avail-
                                 able to an attacker since they might be used for instance to generate cryptographic
                                 keys.

OT.SECURE_AC_ACTIVATION       Secure activation of the Additional Code
                              Activation of the Additional Code and update of the Identification Data shall be per-
                              formed at the same time in an Atomic way. All the operations needed for the code
                              to be able to operate as in the Final TOE shall be completed before activation. If the
                              Atomic Activation is successful, then the resulting product is the Final TOE, otherwise
                              (in case of interruption or incident which prevents the forming of the Final TOE), the
                              Initial TOE shall remain in its initial state or fail secure.

OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION         Secure identification of the TOE
                              The Identification Data identifies the Initial TOE and Additional Code. The TOE pro-
                              vides means to store Identification Data in its non-volatile memory and guarantees
                              the integrity of these data. After Atomic Activation of the Additional Code, the Identifi-
                              cation Data of the Final TOE allows identifications of Initial TOE and Additional Code.
                              The user shall be able to uniquely identify Initial TOE and Additional Code(s) which
                              are embedded in the Final TOE.

5.2        Security Objectives for the Operational Environment
OE.APPLET                   Applet
                            No applet loaded post-issuance shall contain native methods.

OE.VERIFICATION             Bytecode Verification
                            All the bytecodes shall be verified at least once, before the loading, before the instal-
                            lation or before the execution, depending on the card capabilities, in order to ensure
                            that each bytecode is valid at execution time. See SA.VERIFICATION for details.
                            Additionally, the applet shall follow all the recommendations, if any, mandated in the
                            platform guidance for maintaining the isolation property of the platform.
                            Application Note:
                            Constraints to maintain the isolation property of the platform are provided by the plat-
                            form developer in application development guidance. The constraints apply to all
                            application code loaded in the platform.

OE.CODE-EVIDENCE            Code Evidence
                            For application code loaded pre-issuance, evaluated technical measures implemented
                            by the TOE or audited organizational measures must ensure that loaded application
                            has not been changed since the code verifications required in OE.VERIFICATION.
                            For application code loaded post-issuance and verified off-card according to the re-
                            quirements of OE.VERIFICATION, the verification authority shall provide digital ev-
                            idence to the TOE that the application code has not been modified after the code
                            verification and that he is the actor who performed code verification.
                            For application code loaded post-issuance and partially or entirely verified on-card,
                            technical measures must ensure that the verification required in OE.VERIFICATION
                            are performed. On-card bytecode verifier is out of the scope of this Protection Profile.
                            Application Note: For application code loaded post-issuance and verified off-card,
                            the integrity and authenticity evidence can be achieved by electronic signature of the
                            application code, after code verification, by the actor who performed verification.

OE.APPS-PROVIDER            Application Provider
                            The AP shall be a trusted actor that provides applications. The AP is responsible for
                            its security domain keys.

OE.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY   Verification Authority
                            The VA should be a trusted actor who is able to verify bytecode of an application
                            loaded on the card, guarantee and generate the digital signature attached to an ap-
                            plication and ensure that its public key for verifying the application signature is on the
                            TOE.

OE.KEY-CHANGE               Security Domain Key Change
                            The AP must change its security domain initial keys before any operation on it.

OE.USE_KEYS                        Protection of OPE keys
                                   During the TOE usage, the terminal or system in interaction with the TOE, shall ensure
                                   the protection (integrity and confidentiality) of their own keys by operational means
                                   and/or procedures.

                                   Security procedures shall be used after TOE Delivery up to delivery to the end-
                                   consumer to maintain confidentiality and integrity of the TOE and of its manufacturing
                                   and test data (to prevent any possible copy, modification, retention, theft or unautho-
                                   rised use). This means that Phases after TOE Delivery up to the end of Phase 6 must
                                   be protected appropriately.

OE.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE.CR          Confidentiality of Update Image - CREATE
EATE
                                   The off-card Update Image Creator ensures that the image is signed and transferred
                                   encrypted to the device and is not disclosed during the creation and transfer. The
                                   keys used for signing and encrypting the image are kept confidential.


5.3        Security Objectives Rationale
In this section it is proven that the security objectives described in Chapter 4 can be traced for all aspects identified
in the TOE-security environment and that they are suited to cover them. At least one security objective results
from each assumption, OSP, and each threat. At least one threat, one OSP or assumption exists for each security
objective.

5.3.1      Threats
5.3.1.1 Confidentiality
T.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE.LOAD

           Objective                 Rationale
           OT.CONFID-UPDATE-         Counters the threat by ensuring the confidentiality of D.UPDATE_
           IMAGE.LOAD                IMAGE during installing it on the TOE.
           OE.CONFID-UPDATE-         Counters the threat by ensuring that the D.UPDATE_IMAGE is
           IMAGE.CREATE              not transfered in plain and that the keys are kept secret.


T.CONFID-APPLI-DATA

           Objective                 Rationale
           OT.SID                    Counters this threat by providing correct identification of applets.
           OT.FIREWALL               Counters this threat by providing the Java Card Virtual Machine
                                     Firewall as specified in [4].
           OT.GLOBAL_ARRAYS_CONFID   Counters this threat by preventing the disclosure of the informa-
                                     tion stored in the APDU buffer.
           OT.OPERATE                Counters the threat by ensuring that the firewall, which is dynam-
                                     ically enforced, shall never stop operating.
           OT.REALLOCATION           Counters this threat by preventing any attempt to read a piece
                                     of information that was previously used by an application but has
                                     been logically deleted. It states that any information that was
                                     formerly stored in a memory block shall be cleared before the
                                     block is reused.
           OT.ALARM                  Counters this threat by obtaining clear warning and error mes-
                                     sages from the firewall, which is a software tool automating crit-
                                     ical controls, so that the appropriate countermeasure can be
                                     taken.
           OT.CIPHER                 Contributes to counter this threat by protecting the data shared or
                                     information communicated between applets and the CAD using
                                     cryptographic functions.
           OT.KEY-MNGT               Counters this threat by providing appropriate management of
                                     keys, PIN’s which are particular cases of an application’s sen-
                                     sitive data.
           OT.PIN-MNGT               Counters this threat by providing appropriate management of
                                     keys, PIN’s which are particular cases of an application’s sen-
                                     sitive data.
           OT.TRANSACTION            Counters this threat by providing appropriate management of
                                     keys, PIN’s which are particular cases of an application’s sen-
                                     sitive data.

                                management functions.


T.CONFID-JCS-DATA

           Objective            Rationale
           OT.SID               Counters this threat by providing correct identification of applets.
           OT.FIREWALL          Contributes to counter this threat by providing means of separat-
                                ing data.
           OT.OPERATE           Counters the threat by ensuring that the firewall, which is dynam-

5.3.1.2 Integrity
T.INTEG-UPDATE-IMAGE.LOAD

           Objective              Rationale
           OT.SECURE_LOAD_ACODE   Counters the threat directly by ensuring the authenticity and in-
                                  tegrity of D.UPDATE_IMAGE.


T.INTEG-APPLI-CODE

           Objective              Rationale
           OT.NATIVE              Counters this threat by ensuring that no native code can be run
                                  to modify a piece of code.
           OE.VERIFICATION        Contributes to counter the threat by checking the bytecode. Byte-
                                  code verification ensures that each of the instructions used on
                                  the Java Card platform is used for its intended purpose and in
                                  the intended scope of accessibility. As none of these instruc-
                                  tions enables modifying a piece of code, no Java Card applet can
                                  therefore be executed to modify a piece of code.
           OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT     Contributes to counter this threat by controlling the access to card
                                  management functions.
           OE.CODE-EVIDENCE       The objective OE.CODE-EVIDENCE contributes to counter this
                                  threat by ensuring that integrity and authenticity evidences exist
                                  for the application code loaded into the platform.


T.INTEG-APPLI-CODE.LOAD

           Objective              Rationale
           OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT     Contributes to counter this threat by controlling the access to card
                                  management functions such as the installation, update or dele-
                                  tion of applets.
           OE.CODE-EVIDENCE       Contributes to counter this threat by ensuring that the application
                                  code loaded into the platform has not been changed after code
                                  verification, which ensures code integrity and authenticity.
           OT.APPLI-AUTH          Counters this threat by ensuring that the loading of packages is
                                  done securely and thus preserves the integrity of packages code.

          Objective                Rationale
          OT.GLOBAL_ARRAYS_INTEG   Counters this threat by ensuring the integrity of the information
                                   stored in the APDU buffer. Application data that is sent to the ap-
                                   plet as clear text arrives in the APDU buffer, which is a resource
                                   shared by all applications.
          OT.OPERATE               Counters the threat by ensuring that the firewall, which is dynam-
                                   ically enforced, shall never stop operating.

                                   information that was previously used by an application but has
                                   been logically deleted. It states that any information that was
                                   formerly stored in a memory block shall be cleared before the
                                   block is reused.
          OT.ALARM                 Contributes to counter this threat by obtaining clear warning and
                                   error messages from the firewall, which is a software tool au-
                                   tomating critical controls, so that the appropriate countermeasure
                                   can be taken.
          OT.CIPHER                Contributes to counter this threat by protecting the data shared or
                                   information communicated between applets and the CAD using
                                   cryptographic functions.

                                to modify a piece of code.
           OE.VERIFICATION      Contributes to counter the threat by checking the bytecode. Byte-
                                code verification ensures that each of the instructions used on
                                the Java Card platform is used for its intended purpose and in
                                the intended scope of accessibility. As none of these instruc-
                                tions enables modifying a piece of code, no Java Card applet can

           OE.APPLET            Contributes to counter this threat by ensuring that no native ap-
                                plets shall be loaded in post-issuance.
           OE.VERIFICATION      Contributes to counter the threat by checking the bytecodes.
                                Bytecode verification also prevents the program counter of an
                                applet to jump into a piece of native code by confining the control
                                flow to the currently executed method.

           Objective                   Rationale
           OT.RND                      Counters the threat by ensuring the cryptographic quality of ran-
                                       dom number generation. For instance random numbers shall not
                                       be predictable and shall have sufficient entropy. Furthermore,
                                       the TOE ensures that no information about the produced random
                                       numbers is available to an attacker.


5.3.1.10 Config Applet
T.CONFIG

           Objective                   Rationale
           OT.CARD-CONFIGURATION       Counters the threat by ensuring that the customer can only read
                                       and write customer configuration items using the Customer Con-
                                       figuration Token and NXP can read and write configuration items
                                       using the NXP Configuration Token. If access is disabled config-
                                       uration items can not be read or written.

                                       in a secure state after interruption of the OS Update procedure
                                       (Load Phase).
           OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION       Counters the threat directly by ensuring that D.TOE_IDENTIFI-
                                       CATION is only updated after successful OS Update procedure.
           OT.SECURE_AC_ACTIVATION     Counters the threat directly by ensuring that the update OS is
                                       only activated after successful (atomic) OS Update procedure.

                                      stance is able to import data from the datastore. The verification
                                      is based on the AID of the applet. Data import from the datas-
                                      tore by an applet instance can be done only by a trusted entity
                                      authentified either by sending the import command via a scp or
                                      via untrusted channel using signature and chained hashes.


5.3.2      Organisational Security Policies

                                      verified at least once, before the loading, before the installation
                                      or before the execution in order to ensure that each bytecode is
                                      valid at execution time.
           OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT         Contributing to enforce the OSP by ensuring that the loading of a
                                      package into the card is safe.
           OE.CODE-EVIDENCE           This policy is enforced by the security objective of the environ-
                                      ment OE.CODE-EVIDENCE which ensures that evidences exist
                                      that the application code has been verified and not changed after
                                      verification.
           OT.APPLI-AUTH              Contributing to enforce the OSP by ensuring that the loading of a
                                      package into the card is safe.

6.1.1       Family behavior
This family defines quality requirements for the generation of random numbers which are intended to be use for
cryptographic purposes.

FCS_RNG                Generation of random numbers requires that random numbers meet a defined quality metric.

Management:            FCS_RNG.1
                       There are no management activities foreseen.

Audit:                 FCS_RNG.1
                       There are no actions defined to be auditable.
FCS_RNG.1              Random Number Generation.

Hierarchical to:       No other components.

Dependencies           No dependencies.

FCS_RNG.1.1            The TSF shall provide a [selection: physical, non-physical true, deterministic, hybrid physical,
                       hybrid deterministic] random number generator that implements: [assignment: list of security
                       capabilities].

FCS_RNG.1.2            The TSF shall provide [selection: bits, octets of bits, numbers [assignment: format of the num-
                       bers]] that meet [assignment: a defined quality metric].

                       Application Note: A physical random number generator (RNG) produces the random number by
                       a noise source based on physical random processes. A non-physical true RNG uses a noise
                       source based on non-physical random processes like human interaction (key strokes, mouse
                       movement). A deterministic RNG uses an random seed to produce a pseudorandom output. A
                       hybrid RNG combines the principles of physical and deterministic RNGs where a hybrid physical
                       RNG produces at least the amount of entropy the RNG output may contain and the internal state
                       of a hybrid deterministic RNG output contains fresh entropy but less than the output of RNG may
                       contain.

6.2        Definition of Family ”Audit Data Storage (FAU_SAS)”
This section has been taken over from the certified (BSI-PP-0084-2014) Smartcard IC Platform Protection Profile
[13]. To define the security functional requirements of the TOE an additional family (”Audit Data Storage (FAU_
SAS)”) of the Class ”Security audit (FAU)” is defined here. This family describes the functional requirements for
the storage of audit data. It has a more general approach than FAU_GEN, because it does not necessarily require
the data to be generated by the TOE itself and because it does not give specific details of the content of the audit
records.

6.2.1      Family behavior
This family defines functional requirements for the storage of audit data.

                                               Fig. 6.2: SAS Component


FAU_SAS                 Requires the TOE to provide the possibility to store audit data.

7          Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)
This section states the security functional requirements for the TOE. For readability requirements are arranged into
groups taken from [2]. The permitted operations (assignment, iteration, selection and refinement) of the SFRs
taken from Common Criteria [10] are printed in bold. Completed operations related to the PP are additionally
marked within [ ] where assignments are additionally marked with the keyword "assignment".

              Group                        Description
              Core with Logical Channels   The CoreG_LC contains the requirements concerning the run-
              (CoreG_LC)                   time environment of the Java Card System implementing logi-
                                           cal channels. This includes the firewall policy and the require-
                                           ments related to the Java Card API. Logical channels are a Java
                                           Card specification version 2.2 feature. This group is the union
                                           of requirements from the Core (CoreG) and the logical channels
                                           (LCG) groups defined in [7] (cf. Java Card System Protection
                                           Profile Collection [8]).
              Installation (InstG)         The InstG contains the security requirements concerning the in-
                                           stallation of post-issuance applications. It does not address card
                                           management issues in the broad sense, but only those security
                                           aspects of the installation procedure that are related to applet
                                           execution.
              Applet deletion (ADELG)      The ADELG contains the security requirements for erasing in-
                                           stalled applets from the card, a feature introduced in Java Card
                                           specification version 2.2.
              Remote Method Invocation     The RMIG contains the security requirements for the remote
              (RMIG)                       method invocation feature, which provides a new protocol of com-
                                           munication between the terminal and the applets. This was intro-
                                           duced in Java Card specification version 2.2.
              Object deletion (ODELG)      The ODELG contains the security requirements for the object
                                           deletion capability.   This provides a safe memory recovering
                                           mechanism. This is a Java Card specification version 2.2 fea-
                                           ture.
              Secure carrier (CarG)        The CarG group contains minimal requirements for secure down-
                                           loading of applications on the card. This group contains the se-
                                           curity requirements for preventing, in those configurations that do
                                           not support on-card static or dynamic bytecode verification, the
                                           installation of a package that has not been bytecode verified, or
                                           that has been modified after bytecode verification.
              External Memory (EMG)        The EMG group contains security requirements for the manage-
                                           ment of external memory.

Subjects are active components of the TOE that (essentially) act on the behalf of users. The users of the TOE
include people or institutions (like the applet developer, the card issuer, the verification authority), hardware (like
the CAD where the card is inserted or the PCD) and software components (like the application packages installed
on the card). Some of the users may just be aliases for other users. For instance, the verification authority in
charge of the bytecode verification of the applications may be just an alias for the card issuer. Subjects (prefixed
with an "S") are described in the following table:

             Subject                       Description
             S.ADEL                        The applet deletion manager which also acts on behalf of the
                                           card issuer. It may be an applet ([4], §11), but its role asks any-
                                           way for a specific treatment from the security viewpoint. This
                                           subject is unique and is involved in the ADEL security policy.
              S.CAD                        The CAD represents the actor that requests services by issuing
                                           commands to the card. It also plays the role of the off-card entity
                                           that communicates with the S.INSTALLER.
              S.INSTALLER                  The installer is the on-card entity which acts on behalf of the card
                                           issuer. This subject is involved in the loading of packages and
                                           installation of applets.
             S.JCRE                        The runtime environment under which Java programs in a smart
                                           card are executed.
             S.JCVM                        The bytecode interpreter that enforces the firewall at runtime.
             S.LOCAL                       Operand stack of a JCVM frame, or local variable of a JCVM
                                           frame containing an object or an array of references.
             S.SD                          A GlobalPlatform Security Domain representing on the card a off-
                                           card entity. This entity can be the Issuer, an Application Provider,
                                           the Controlling Authority or the Verification Authority.
             S.MEMBER                      Any object’s field, static field or array position.
             S.PACKAGE                     A package is a namespace within the Java programming lan-
                                           guage that may contain classes and interfaces, and in the context
                                           of Java Card technology, it defines either a user library, or one or
                                           several applets.
             S.OSU                         OSU provides secure functionality to update the TOE operat-
                                           ing system with an image created by a trusted off-card entity
                                           (S.UpdateImageCreator)
             S.UpdateImageCreator          The off-card Update Image Creator ensures that the image is
                                           signed and transferred encrypted to the device and is not dis-

                              • Standard ones, whose both fields and methods are under the firewall policy,
                              • Shareable interface Objects (SIO), which provide a secure mechanism for inter-
                                 applet communication,
                              • JCRE entry points (Temporary or Permanent), who have freely accessible methods
                                 but protected fields,
                              • Global arrays, having both unprotected fields (including components; refer to JavaC-
                                 ardClass discussion above) and methods.

                           When a new object is created, it is associated with the Currently Active Context. But the
                           object is owned by the applet instance within the Currently Active Context when the object
                           is instantiated ([4], §6.1.3). An object is owned by an applet instance, by the JCRE or
                           by the package library where it has been defined (these latter objects can only be arrays
                           that initialize static fields of packages).
                           ([4], Glossary) Selected Applet Context. The Java Card RE keeps track of the currently
                           selected Java Card applet. Upon receiving a SELECT command with this applet’s AID,
                           the Java Card RE makes this applet the Selected Applet Context. The Java Card RE
                           sends all APDU commands to the Selected Applet Context.
                           While the expression ”Selected Applet Context” refers to a specific installed applet, the
                           relevant aspect to the policy is the context (package AID) of the selected applet. In this
                           policy, the ”Selected Applet Context” is the AID of the selected package.
                           ([4], §6.1.2.1) At any point in time, there is only one active context within the Java Card
                           VM (this is called the Currently Active Context).
                           It should be noticed that the invocation of static methods (or access to a static field) is
                           not considered by this policy, as there are no firewall rules. They have no effect on the
                           active context as well and the ”acting package” is not the one to which the static method
                           belongs to in this case.
                           It should be noticed that the Java Card platform, version 2.2.x and version 3 Classic
                           Edition, introduces the possibility for an applet instance to be selected on multiple logical
                           channels at the same time, or accepting other applets belonging to the same package
                           being selected simultaneously. These applets are referred to as multiselectable applets.
                           Applets that belong to a same package are either all multiselectable or not ([5], §2.2.5).
                           Therefore, the selection mode can be regarded as an attribute of packages. No selection
                           mode is defined for a library package.
                           An applet instance will be considered an active applet instance if it is currently selected in
                           at least one logical channel. An applet instance is the currently selected applet instance
                           only if it is processing the current command. There can only be one currently selected
                           applet instance at a given time. ([4], §4).

AppNote                      The following rules are given as examples only. For instance, the last two rules are
                             motivated by the fact that the Java Card API defines only transient arrays factory methods.
                             Future versions may allow the creation of transient objects belonging to arbitrary classes;
                             such evolution will naturally change the range of ”secure values” for this component.

                                 • The Context attribute of an O.JAVAOBJECT must correspond to that of an installed
                                  applet or be ”Java Card RE”.
                                 • An O.JAVAOBJECT whose Sharing attribute is a Java Card RE entry point or a
                                  global array necessarily has ”Java Card RE” as the value for its Context security
                                  attribute.

                                  ”array of primitive type” as a JavaCardClass security attribute’s value.
                                 • Any O.JAVAOBJECT whose Sharing attribute value is not ”Standard” has a PERSISTENT-
                                  LifeTime attribute’s value.
                                 • Any O.JAVAOBJECT whose LifeTime attribute value is not PERSISTENT has an

                                     creator’s Context attribute and AID respectively ([4], §6.1.3). There is one default
                                     value for the Selected Applet Context that is the default applet identifier’s Context,
                                     and one default value for the Currently Active Context that is ”Java Card RE”.
                                   • The knowledge of which reference corresponds to a temporary entry point object or

7.1.1.2    Application Programming Interface
The following SFRs are related to the Java Card API. The whole set of cryptographic algorithms is generally not
implemented because of limited memory resources and/or limitations due to exportation. Therefore, the following
requirements only apply to the implemented subset. It should be noticed that the execution of the additional native
code is not within the TSF. Nevertheless, access to API native methods from the Java Card System is controlled
by TSF because there is no difference between native and interpreted methods in their interface or invocation
mechanism.

AppNote                     A resource is allocated to the bArray object when a call to an applet’s install() method is
                            performed. There is no conflict with FDP_ROL.1 here because of the bounds on the roll-
                            back mechanism (FDP_ROL.1.2[FIREWALL]): the scope of the rollback does not extend
                            outside the execution of the install() method, and the de-allocation occurs precisely right

AppNote                     Transactions are a service offered by the APIs to applets. It is also used by some APIs
                            to guarantee the atomicity of some operation. This mechanism is either implemented
                            in Java Card platform or relies on the transaction mechanism offered by the underlying
                            platform. Some operations of the API are not conditionally updated, as documented in
                            [3] (see for instance, PIN-blocking, PIN-checking, update of Transient objects).

Refinement                  The following data elements have the user data attribute ”integrity protected data”:

                               • D.APP_KEYs
                               • D.PIN
                               • D.TOE_IDENTIFIER

AppNote                        • Although no such requirement is mandatory in the Java Card specification, at least
                                 an exception shall be raised upon integrity errors detection on cryptographic keys,
                                 PIN values and their associated security attributes. Even if all the objects cannot be
                                 monitored, cryptographic keys and PIN objects shall be considered with particular
                                 attention by ST authors as they play a key role in the overall security.
                               • It is also recommended to monitor integrity errors in the code of the native applica-
                                 tions and Java Card applets.
                               • For integrity sensitive application, their data shall be monitored (D.APP_I_DATA):
                                 applications may need to protect information against unexpected modifications, and
                                 explicitly control whether a piece of information has been changed between two
                                 accesses. For example, maintaining the integrity of an electronic purse’s balance
                                 is extremely important because this value represents real money. Its modification
                                 must be controlled, for illegal ones would denote an important failure of the payment
                                 system.
                               • A dedicated library could be implemented and made available to developers to
                                 achieve better security for specific objects, following the same pattern that already
                                 exists in cryptographic APIs, for instance.

AppNote                     Although it is not required in [4] specifications, the non-observability of operations on
                            sensitive information such as keys appears as impossible to circumvent in the smart
                            card world. The precise list of operations and objects is left unspecified, but should at
                            least concern secret keys and PIN codes when they exists on the card, as well as the
                            cryptographic operations and comparisons performed on them.

AppNote                          • By users here it must be understood the ones associated to the packages (or ap-
                                   plets) that act as subjects of policies. In the Java Card System, every action is
                                   always performed by an identified user interpreted here as the currently selected
                                   applet or the package that is the subject’s owner. Means of identification are pro-

                                  • Should the installer fail during loading/installation of a package/applet, it has to
                                    revert to a ”consistent and secure state”. The Java Card RE has some clean up
                                    duties as well; see [4], §11.1.5 for possible scenarios. Precise behavior is left to
                                    implementers. This component shall include among the listed failures the deletion
                                    of a package/applet. See ([4], §11.3.4) for possible scenarios. Precise behavior is

                                    partially handled by the underlying hardware platform (see [13]) and, from the TOE’s
                                    side, by events ”that clear transient objects” and transactional features. See FPT_

                                  • The quantification is implementation dependent, but some facts can be recalled
                                    here. First, the SCP ensures the atomicity of updates for fields and objects, and a
                                    power-failure during a transaction or the normal runtime does not create the loss of
                                    otherwise permanent data, in the sense that memory on a smart card is essentially
                                    persistent with this respect (EEPROM). Data stored on the RAM and subject to
                                    such failure is intended to have a limited lifetime anyway (runtime data on the stack,
                                    transient objects’ contents). According to this, the loss of data within the TSF scope
                                    should be limited to the same restrictions of the transaction mechanism.

                               • This policy introduces the notion of reachability, which provides a general means to
                                 describe objects that are referenced from a certain applet instance or package.
                               • S.ADEL calls the ”uninstall” method of the applet instance to be deleted, if imple-
                                 mented by the applet, to inform it of the deletion request. The order in which these
                                 calls and the dependencies checks are performed are out of the scope of this pro-
                                 tection profile.

                                    mechanism: the execution of requestObjectDeletion() is not in the scope of the
                                    rollback because it must be performed in between APDU command processing,
                                    and therefore no transaction can be in progress.

                                         Tab. 7.41: SFRs Dependencies


7.4.1      Rationale for Exclusion of Dependencies
The dependency FIA_UID.1 of FMT_SMR.1[INSTALLER] is unsupported. This ST does not require the iden-
tification of the "installer" since it can be considered as part of the TSF.
The dependency FIA_UID.1 of FMT_SMR.1[ADEL] is unsupported. This ST does not require the identification
of the "deletion manager" since it can be considered as part of the TSF.
The dependency FMT_SMF.1 of FMT_MSA.1[JCRE] is unsupported. The dependency between FMT_MSA.1[JCRE]
and FMT_SMF.1 is not satisfied because no management functions are required for the Java Card RE.
The dependency FAU_SAA.1 of FAU_ARP.1 is unsupported. The dependency of FAU_ARP.1 on FAU_SAA.1
assumes that a "potential security violation" generates an audit event. On the contrary, the events listed in FAU_
ARP.1 are self-contained (arithmetic exception, ill-formed bytecodes, access failure) and ask for a straightforward
reaction of the TSFs on their occurrence at runtime. The JCVM or other components of the TOE detect these
events during their usual working order. Thus, there is no mandatory audit recording in this ST.
The dependency FIA_UAU.1 of FIA_AFL.1[PIN] is unsupported. The TOE implements the firewall access
control SFP, based on which access to the object Implementing FIA_AFL.1[PIN] is organized.


7.5        Security Assurance Requirements Rationale
The selection of assurance components is based on the underlying PP [2]. The Security Target uses the augmen-
tations from the PP, chooses EAL5 and adds the components AVA_VAN.5, ASE_TSS.2, ADV_DVS.2 and ALC_
FLR.1. The requirement of the PP [2] to choose at least EAL4 is fulfilled. The rationale for the augmentations is
the same as in the PP. The assurance level EAL5 is an elaborated pre-defined level of the CC, part 3 [11]. The
assurance components in an EAL level are chosen in a way that they build a mutually supportive and complete
set of components. The additional requirements chosen for augmentation do not add any dependencies, which
are not already fulfilled for the corresponding requirements contained in EAL5. Therefore, the components AVA_
VAN.5, ASE_TSS.2 ALC_DVS.2 and ALC_FLR.1 add additional assurance to EAL5, but the mutual support of
the requirements is still guaranteed.

SF.JCVM                  Java Card Virtual Machine

                         SF.JCVM provides the Java Card Virtual Machine including byte code interpretation and the Java
                         Card Firewall according to the specifications [4, 5]. This fulfills the SFRs FDP_IFC.1[JCVM],
                         FDP_IFF.1[JCVM], FMT_SMF.1, FMT_SMR.1, FDP_ROL.1[FIREWALL], FDP_ACF.1[FIREWALL],
                         FDP_ACC.2[FIREWALL] and FIA_UID.2[AID]. SF.JCVM supports FAU_ARP.1 and FPT_FLS.1

                      MSA.3[FIREWALL], and FMT_MSA.3[JCVM].
                      SF.JCVM ensures together with SF.PERS_MEM that the system is halted in case non existing
                      Java objects could be referenced after an aborted transaction to fulfill FDP_RIP.1[ABORT].

SF.AM                 Applet Migration

                      The SF.AM enables applet update while applet personalization data is preserved. In particular,
                      the implementation of the Applet Migration feature supports the functions for export and import
                      of applet data and thus, covers the SFR FMT_SMF.1[AMD].
                      The Applet Migration feature relies on the ArchiveManager component which controls and man-
                      ages the data import and export steps and so, stores the AIDs of the exporting and importing
                      applets instances. Thus, it enforces the SFR FMT_SMR.1[AMD].
                      The Applet Migration process relies on an access control policy based on old/new applet AIDs
                      which controls the access of applet instances to the migrated data. This enforces the SFRs FDP_
                      ACC.1[AMD] and FDP_ACF.1[AMD]. The AID of the exporting and importing applet instances
                      used in the access control policy can be set only by the ArchiveManager and thus, the Applet
                      Migration covers the SFR FMT_MSA.3[AMD] and FMT_MSA.1[AMD]. The ArchiveManager is
                      also the component setting the Applet Migration Plan and so satisfies FMT_MSA.3[AMD] and
                      FDP_IFC.2[AMD].
                      The Applet Migration process also requires authentication of the off card entity that sends the
                      Applet Migration commands for import and export. The import/export steps are performed either
                      via a secure channel protocol with authentication or via a proprietary protocol which uses an
                      electronic signature that is verified by a public key residing on the TOE. These measures satisfy
                      the SFRs FIA_UAU.5[AMD], FDP_IFF.1[AMD], FDP_IFC.2[AMD] and FIA_UID.1[AMD].
                      In case the export or import phase fail then the an exception is thrown and the system preserves
                      secure state. Thus, the Applet Migration functionality fulfills the SFR FPT_FLS.1[AMD]

SF.CONFIG             Configuration Management

                      SF.CONFIG provides means to change configurations of the card. Some configurations can
                      be changed by the customer and some can only be changed by NXP (FDP_IFC.2[CFG], FDP_
                      IFF.1[CFG], FMT_MSA.3[CFG], FMT_MSA.1[CFG], FMT_SMR.1[CFG], FMT_SMF.1[CFG], FIA_
                      UID.1[CFG]). SF.CONFIG supports FCS_COP.1 by configuring the behavior of cryptographic op-
                      erations.
                      Additionally, SF.CONFIG provides proprietary commands to select (FIA_UID.1[SC]) the OS up-
                      date mechanism SF.OSU and to reset the OS to an initial state (FAU_ARP.1 and FPT_FLS.1).

8.3        Protection against Interference and Logical Tampering
The protection of JCOP against Interference and Logical Tampering is implemented in software within the TOE
and supported by the hardware of the micro controller.
The software protection of the TOE makes use of software security services which allow to detect and react on
manipulation of the TOE. Two types of reactions are used: If invalid data from outside the TOE is detected then it
is assumed that the TOE was used in a wrong way. This is indicated by an appropriate Status Word or Exception.

Detected deviations from the physical operating conditions and inconsistencies of internal states and program
flow however are considered to be an attack to the TOE. In such cases an internal Attack Counter is increased.
Once the Attack Counter reaches the maximum value, the TOE will go into Restricted Mode.
Typical software security mechanisms implemented in the TOE are e.g.:

     • Complex patterned values are used instead of boolean values which are sensible to tampering (only one bit
       needs to be changed to manipulate a false into a true).

     • Small random delays are inserted in the program flow to make successful physical interfering more difficult.

     • Secret information like Keys or PINs are stored encrypted in the TOE. The Masterkey to decrypt these is not
       accessible during normal operation.

     • Critical data is read after it has been written to non volatile memory.

     • Enhanced cryptographic support is based on the certified Security Software for DES, AES, ECC and RSA
       including protection against fault injection and random number generation.

     • Critical values (like PINs) are compared timing-invariant. This prevents from side channel attacks.

A full list of software countermeasures is contained in ADV_ARC.
Further protection against Tampering and Logical Interference is realized by the MMU implemented in hardware.
The MMU is able to perform access control to all types of memory. The special function registers access can be
restricted by the bridges between the CPU and the peripherals.
JCOP defines several MMU contexts which restrict access to memory areas. The Master key is stored in specific
coprocessor registers and blocked for reading/writing during JCOP operation.
Additionally Interference and Logical Tampering is prevented by hardware security services. The JCOP runs on a
certified smart card HW platform which protects against bypass by physical and logical means such as:

     • cryptographic coprocessors (for symmetric and asymmetric cryptography) protected against DPA and DFA,

     • enhanced security sensors for clock frequency range, low and high temperature sensor, supply voltage
       sensors Single Fault Injection (SFI) attack detection, light sensors, and

     • encryption of data stored in persistent and transient memory.


8.4        Protection against Bypass of Security Related Actions
JCOP prevents bypassing security related actions by several software counter measures. Different mechanisms
are used depending on the software environment.
Generally all input parameter are validated and in case of incorrect parameters the program flow is interrupted.
Such event is indicated by an appropriate Status Word or Exception. This prevents the TOE from being attacked
by undefined or unauthorized commands or data.
Basic protection is contributed by implementation of following standards within the TOE:

     • Java Applets are separated from each other as defined in the Java Card specifications [3, 4, 5]. The sep-
       aration is achieved by implementation of the firewall which prevents Applets to access data belonging to a
       different Java Card context. Sharing information between different contexts is possible by supervision of the
       well defined Java Card Firewall mechanism implemented in the TOE.

     • Access to security relevant Applications in the TOE (like Security Domains) is protected by the Secure
       Channel mechanism defined by Global platform [21]. The secure channel allows access to Applications
       only if the secret keys are known. Further protection implemented in JCOP prevents brute force attacks to
       the secret keys of the Secure Channel.

The following mechanisms ensure that it is not possible to access information from the Java Layer without being
authorized to do so.

     • Status informations like Life Cycle of Applets or the Authentication State of a Secure Channel are stored in
       complex patterned values which protects them from manipulation.

     • Correct order of Java Card Byte Code execution is ensured by the Virtual Machine which detects if Byte
       Code of a wrong context is executed.

     • Correct processing of Byte Codes is ensured by checking at the beginning and end of Byte Code execution
       that the same Byte Code is executed.

Execution of native code in the JCOP is protected by following mechanisms:

     • Critical execution paths of the TOE functionality are protected by program flow and call tree protection. This
       ensures that it is not possible to bypass security relevant checks and verifications.

     • Critical conditions are evaluated twice. This ensures that physical attacks on the compared values are
       detected during security relevant checks and verifications.

     • The true case in if-conditions leads to the less critical program flow or to an error case. This prevents attacks
       on the program flow during security relevant checks and verifications.

     • At the exit of critical loops it is checked that the whole loop was processed. This prevents from manipulation
       of the program flow and jumping out of the loop.

     • Critical parameters are check for consistency. This prevents from attacks with manipulated parameters.

Further protection is achieved by using different buffers for APDUs in case more than one physical interface is
supported. This prevents bypassing the state machine on one physical interface by the other interface.

10         Glossary
Additional Code Code activated by the Atomic Activation on the Initial TOE to generate the final TOE. For in-
     stance, Additional Code could: correct flaws, add new functionalities, update the operating system. Also
     referred to as D.UPDATE_IMAGE.

APDU buffer The APDU buffer is the buffer where the messages sent (received) by the card depart from (ar-
    rive to). The JCRE owns an APDU object (which is a JCRE Entry Point and an instance of the javac-
    ard.framework.APDU class) that encapsulates APDU messages in an internal byte array, called the APDU
    buffer. This object is made accessible to the currently selected applet when needed, but any permanent
    access (out-of selection-scope) is strictly prohibited for security reasons.

applet deletion manager The on-card component that embodies the mechanisms necessary to delete an applet
     or library and its associated data on smart cards using Java Card technology.

Atomic Activation The Loader guarantees at activation time that the loaded Additional Code is activated and
    that the Identification Data of the TOE is updated. This functionality is called Atomic Activation. If the Atomic
    Activation is successful, then the resulting product is the Final TOE, otherwise (in case of interruption or
    incident which prevents the forming of the Final TOE), the Initial TOE shall remain in its initial state or fail
    secure.

context A context is an object-space partition associated to a package. Applets within the same Java technology-
     based package belong to the same context. The firewall is the boundary between contexts (see "current
     context").

current context The JCRE keeps track of the current Java Card System context (also called "the active context").
     When a virtual method is invoked on an object, and a context switch is required and permitted, the current
     context is changed to correspond to the context of the applet that owns the object. When that method
     returns, the previous context is restored. Invocations of static methods have no effect on the current context.
     The current context and sharing status of an object together determine if access to an object is permissible.

currently selected applet The applet has been selected for execution in the current session. The Java Card RE
     keeps track of the currently selected Java Card applet. Upon receiving a SELECT command from the CAD
     or PCD with this applet’s AID, the Java Card RE makes this applet the currently selected applet over the I/O
     interface that received the command. The Java Card RE sends all further APDU commands received over
     each interface to the currently selected applet on this interface ([4], Glossary).

default applet The applet that is selected after a card reset ([4], §4.1).

Final TOE The Final TOE is generated from the Initial TOE and the Additional Code. It is the resulting product of
      the Atomic Activation of the Additional Code onto the Initial TOE..

Initial TOE The Initial TOE is the product on which the Additional Code is loaded and with the Loader as part of
       the embedded software.

installer The installer is the on-card application responsible for the installation of applets on the card. It may per-
      form (or delegate) mandatory security checks according to the card issuer policy (for bytecode-verification,
      for instance), loads and link packages (CAP file(s)) on the card to a suitable form for the Java Card VM to
      execute the code they contain. It is a subsystem of what is usually called “card manager”; as such, it can be
      seen as the portion of the card manager that belongs to the TOE.
      The installer has an AID that uniquely identifies him, and may be implemented as a Java Card applet.
      However, it is granted specific privileges on an implementation-specific manner ([4], §10).

interface A special kind of Java programming language class, which declares methods, but provides no imple-
      mentation for them. A class may be declared as being the implementation of an interface, and in this case
      must contain an implementation for each of the methods declared by the interface (See also shareable
      interface).

Java Card RE The runtime environment under which Java programs in a smart card are executed. It is in charge
     of all the management features such as applet lifetime, applet isolation, object sharing, applet loading, applet
     initializing, transient objects, the transaction mechanism and so on.

Java Card RE Entry Point An object owned by the Java Card RE context but accessible by any application.
     These methods are the gateways through which applets request privileged Java Card RE services: the
     instance methods associated to those objects may be invoked from any context, and when that occurs, a
     context switch to the Java Card RE context is performed.
     There are two categories of Java Card RE Entry Point Objects: Temporary ones and Permanent ones. As
     part of the firewall functionality, the Java Card RE detects and restricts attempts to store references to these
     objects.

Java Card RMI Java Card Remote Method Invocation is the Java Card System version 2.2 and 3 Classic Edition
     mechanism enabling a client application running on the CAD platform to invoke a method on a remote object

           on the card. Notice that in Java Card System, version 2.1.1, the only method that may be invoked from the
           CAD is the process method of the applet class and that in Java Card System, version 3 Classic Edition, this
           functionality is optional.

Java Card System Java Card System includes the Java Card RE, the Java Card VM, the Java Card API and the
     installer.

Java Card VM The embedded interpreter of bytecodes. The Java Card VM is the component that enforces
     separation between applications (firewall) and enables secure data sharing.

Load Phase The Load Phase is starting at the beginning of the Additional Code loading and ending at the end
    of Atomic Activation. During the Load Phase, the Initial TOE shall be in a secure state..

Loader The Loader is the software developed by the Product Manufacturer. It is used to load and activate the
    Additional Code into the Product FLASH or EEPROM memory. The Loader is included in the embedded
    software and is considered as part of the Initial TOE. see also UpdaterOS.

logical channel A logical link to an application on the card. A new feature of the Java Card System, version
     2.2 and 3 Classic Edition, that enables the opening of simultaneous sessions with the card, one per logical
     channel. Commands issued to a specific logical channel are forwarded to the active applet on that logical
     channel. Java Card platform, version 2.2.2 and 3 Classic Edition, enables opening up to twenty logical
     channels over each I/O interface (contacted or contactless).

MC FW Microcontroller Firmware. Firmware for booting and low level functionality of the Micro Controller.

NVRAM Non-Volatile Random Access Memory, a type of memory that retains its contents when power is turned
    off.

object deletion The Java Card System version 2.2 and 3 Classic Edition mechanism ensures that any unrefer-
     enced persistent (transient) object owned by the current context is deleted. The associated memory space
     is recovered for reuse prior to the next card reset.

OS Update OS Update process/mechanism of JCOP.

package A package is a namespace within the Java programming language that may contain classes and inter-
    faces. A package defines either a user library, or one or more applet definitions. A package is divided in two
    sets of files: export files (which exclusively contain the public interface information for an entire package of
    classes, for external linking purposes; export files are not used directly in a Java Card virtual machine) and
    CAP files.

shareable interface An interface declaring a collection of methods that an applet accepts to share with other
     applets. These interface methods can be invoked from an applet in a context different from the context of
     the object implementing the methods, thus “traversing” the firewall.

subject An active entity within the TOE that causes information to flow among objects or change the system’s
     status. It usually acts on the behalf of a user. Objects can be active and thus are also subjects of the TOE.

transient object An object whose contents are not preserved across CAD sessions. The contents of these
     objects are cleared at the end of the current CAD session or when a card reset is performed. Writes to the
     fields of a transient object are not affected by transactions.

UpdaterOS OS that implements the OS Update.

user Any application interpretable by the Java Card RE. That also covers the packages. The associated sub-
     ject(s), if applicable, is (are) an object(s) belonging to the javacard.framework.applet class.

11         Acronyms
AID Application Identifier, an ISO-7816 data format used for unique identification of Java Card applications (and
    certain kinds of files in card file systems). The Java Card platform uses the AID data format to identify
    applets and packages. AIDs are administered by the International Standards Organization (ISO), so they
    can be used as unique identifiers.
    AIDs are also used in the security policies (see ’Context’ below): applets’ AIDs are related to the selection
    mechanisms, packages’ AIDs are used in the enforcement of the firewall. Note: although they serve different
    purposes, they share the same name space.

AP Application Provider.

applet The name is given to a Java Card technology-based user application. An applet is the basic piece of code
     that can be selected for execution from outside the card. Each applet on the card is uniquely identified by
     its AID.

APSD Application Provider Security Domain.

ARM Advanced RISC Machine.

CAD Card Acceptance Device, or card reader. The device where the card is inserted, and which is used to
    communicate with the card.

DFA Differential Fault Analysis, a side channel attack that induces faults into cryptographic implementations, to
    reveal their internal states..

DPA Differential Power Analysis is a form of side channel attack in which an attacker studies the power consump-
    tion of a cryptographic hardware device such as a smart card.
