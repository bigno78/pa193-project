    2.4         TOE Overview

2.4.1               TOE Definition
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) addressed by this ST is an electronic passport representing a smart card
implementing [ICAO_9303_10], [ICAO_9303_11], [TR-03110_1] and [TR-03110_3]. This smart card / passport
provides the following application:
     the travel document containing the related user data as well as data needed for authentication with BAC,
     PACE, EAC or AA protocols (incl. PACE/BAC passwords); this application is intended to be used by
     governmental organisations as a machine readable travel document (MRTD).
For the ePassport application, the travel document holder can control access to his user data by conscious
presenting his travel document to governmental organisations.The travel document’s chip is integrated into a
physical (plastic or paper), optically readable part of the travel document, which – as the final product – shall
eventually supersede still existing, merely optically readable travel documents. The plastic or paper, optically
readable cover of the travel document, where the travel document’s chip is embedded in, is not part of the
TOE. The tying-up of the travel document’s chip to the plastic travel document is achieved by physical and
organizational security measures being out of scope of the TOE.

2.4.2               TOE Operational Usage
A State or Organization issues MRTDs to be used by the holder for international travel. The traveler presents a
MRTD to the inspection system to prove his or her identity. The MRTD in context of this ST contains (i) visual
(eye readable) biographical data and portrait of the holder, (ii) a separate data summary (MRZ data) for visual
and machine reading using OCR methods (see [ICAO_9303_01]) in the Machine readable zone (MRZ) and (iii)
data elements on the MRTD’s chip. The authentication of the traveller is based on (i) the possession of a valid
travel document personalised for a holder with the claimed identity as given on the biographical data page and
(ii) biometrics using the reference data stored in the travel document. The issuing State or Organisation ensures
the authenticity of the data of genuine travel documents. The receiving State trusts a genuine travel document
of an issuing State or Organisation.

2.4.3               TOE Major Security Features
The following TOE security features are the most significant for its operational use:
    Verifying authenticity and integrity as well as securing confidentiality of user data in the communication
     channel between the TOE and the connected terminal supporting the protocols BAC, SAC(PACE) as per
     [ICAO_9303_11] and EAC as per [TR-03110_1]
    Averting of inconspicuous tracing of the travel document as per [TR-03110_1]
    Self-protection of the TOE security functionality and the data stored inside as per [TR-03110_1]
    Means to check authenticity of the terminal, Terminal Authentication as per [TR-03110_1]
    Means to prove authenticity of the chip by means of Active Authentication or Chip Authentication as per [TR-
     03110_1]
    Chip authentication followed by terminal authentication used as a precondition to provide access to
     biometric data known as EAC, as per [TR-03110_1]

 2.6              TOE Description

2.6.1               Component Overview
The TOE is a DI chip with the ePassport configuration of SECORA™ ID S Infineon Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0.
It is based on the requirements from the ICAO for machine readable travel documents, i.e. [ICAO_9303_10],
[ICAO_9303_11], [TR-03110_1] and [TR-03110_3].
Figure 1 shows the TOE in terms of its components.
The grey color indicates what contributes to fulfill the security claims in this ST. The white color indicates
optional components which are not in the scope of the security claims of this ST, in CC terminology these are
non interefering with the TSF of the TOE.
   -    The two lower layers in the picture represent the smart card controller referenced by IFX_CCI_000005
        together with the Firmware, Asymmetric Cryptographic Library (ACL) and a Symmetric Crypto Library
        (SCL). Note that these components are certified by the same CC certificate BSI-DSZ-CC-1110-V2-2019.
        The hardware platform provides effective protection mechanisms against fault attacks. The platform
        contains hardware co-processors, which support cryptographic standards such as TDES, AES, RSA and
        EC. The hardware co-processor SCP has integrated measures against successful SCA.
   -    The OS platform called “Secora ID S” is a Java Card OS and offers services for:
                 The standard Java Card features like API, the Java Card Runtime Environment and the Java
                  Card Virtual Machine
               Proprietary PACE API providing special countermeasures against side channel leakage
               GP for content management
               Crypto operations (hash, EC, RSA, TDES and AES)
               Communication via the contactless interface and contact interface.
        It is certified in Common Criteria under the Certificate NSCIB-CC-175887.
        Secora ID S supports the standard open Java Card mode as well as the proprietary static mode
        (installation of preloaded code is possible) and the proprietary mode native (specially tailored mode for
        eMRTD usecase which enforces non traceablity of the TOE). Open and static modes are the two possible

       modes during personalization of the TOE. The TOE goes into native mode once the personalization is
       terminated. See [ST_JC_ID_S_Platform] for more details on the supported modes in Secora ID S OS.
   -   ISO or EU Electronic Driving License (eDL) or an Electronic ID(eID) are configurations of SECORA™ ID S
       Applet Infineon Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0. For more information on these optional features refer
       to [UserGuideDataBook], [UserGuideAdmin]. As already said these applications are not part of the TOE
       Security Functionalities and are non interfering with the TSFs of the TOE. The installation of eDL and
       eID is done by the customer who uses the cap file of SECORA™ ID S Applet Infineon Applet Collection
       preloaded on the card by Infineon. Again, no claims of the security for the eDL or the eID applications
       are made in this ST.
   -   ePassport configuration of SECORA™ ID S Applet Infineon Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0 is a Java Card
       applet which provides the functions of the electronic Passport as per [ICAO_9303_10], [ICAO_9303_11],
       [TR-03110_1] and [TR-03110_3].
       The installation of ePass is done by the customer who uses for this purpose the cap file of SECORA™ ID
       S Applet Infineon Applet Collection preloaded on the card by Infineon.
       The applet uses the services of the Java Card Secora ID S OS described above. It manages the various
       stages of the product’s lifecycle once the application is onto the hardware up to its end of life. The
       application implements the protocols:
                 BAC
                 PACE
                 EAC
                 AA
       It does not implement any cryptographic primitives, as these are provided by the underlying Java Card
       OS. Further it manages file access control and authentication failure handling. Also the application
       controls the secure messaging including error handling using the Java Card OS Crypto services, which
       subsequently relies on the features of the underlying hardware providing high integrity and side
       channel protection. The claims in terms of SFRs in this ST target the SECORA™ ID S Applet Infineon
       Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0.

   -   Third party applications can be installed by the customer and running on the card. Note that in this
       case the JC Secora ID S is delivered in open mode, see [ST_JC_ID_S_Platform] to the customer which
       will be then able to load and install 3rd party applications.
The TOE user guidance comprises:
   -   [UserGuideDataBook] and [UserGuideAdmin] which provide guidance, how to perform personalization
       and maintain the targeted security level during Personalisation and Operation phase.

Figure 1      TOE components overview




2.6.2              Interfaces of the TOE
   -    The physical interface of the TOE to the external environment is the entire surface of the IC.
   -    The RF interface (radio frequency power and signal interface) enabling contactless communication
        between a PICC (proximity integration chip card, PICC) and a terminal reader/writer (proximity coupling
        device, terminal). The transmission protocol meets [ISO/IEC 14443-3] and [ISO/IEC 14443-4] Type B.
   -    The contact based interface ISO 7816-3 supported for the purposes of eID and eDL.
   -    The command interface to the TOE is provided by the ePassport Application.



2.6.3              Package Types
The TOE package types and formats are exactly the same as for the underlying Java Card OS. The package
types and formats of the Java Card OS Secora ID S are described in [ST_JC_ID_S_Platform], section 1.4.3 and
1.4.6.


2.6.4              Lifecycle and Delivery
The [PP_EAC], [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC] define the lifecycle phases for the TOE as follows:
1. Development
   - Step 1: Development of hardware and IC dedicated software (firmware)
   - Step 2: Development of IC embedded software

2. Manufacturing
   - Step 3: manufacturing of IC and IC dedicated software. As the TOE does not provide any user ROM,
       manufacturing of IC embedded software parts in ROM are not relevant here.
   - Step 4 (optional): Combination of IC with contactless interface of the travel document
   - Step 5 (Prepersonalization): loading on the device of the executable Java Card OS image. Loading of
       the application JC package containing the TOE code, eDL and eID code.
3. Personalisation of Travel Document
   - Step 6: this step is performed by the customer. The customer receives from Infineon the TOE
       composed of the following components:
           o The underlying hardware
           o The underlying Java Card OS can be in two possible modes: either in the standard Java Card
                open mode (loading and installation of applets are possible) or in the proprietary Java Card
                static mode (preloaded by Infineon packages can be installed, applet loading is not possible).
           o The cap file of SECORA™ ID S Applet Infineon Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0 is preloaded by
                Infineon.
           o The customer then proceeds to installing the ePassport configuration of SECORA™ ID S Infineon
                Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0 and optionally installing the ISO/EU eDL or eID. In case the
                Secora ID S is in open mode the customer can load and install 3rd party applets. During this step
                the customer also performs the personalisation with biometric data and configuration of the
                TSF if necessary.
4. Operational Use
   - Step 7: once the personalization of the product is finished, the Java Card ID S OS is switched to its
       proprietary native mode usage of the TOE by the personalizer. Native mode switches off GP and
       identification commands to disallow tracking of the end user.

 7.3          Security Requirements Rationale

7.3.1             Security Functional Requirements Rationale
Respective sections 6.3.1 “Security Functional Requirements Rationale” of [PP_SAC], [PP_BAC] and [PP_EAC]
are applicable for this chapter.
For the additionally defined SFRs in this ST, FIA_API.1/AA, FMT_MTD.1/AA and FCS_COP.1/SIG_GEN formalizing
the Active Authentication feature they meet the security objective OT.Active_Auth.




7.3.2             Rationale for SFR’s Dependencies
[PP_SAC], [PP_BAC] and [PP_EAC] section 6.3.2 “Rationale for SFR’s Dependencies” are also applicable for this
chapter.


7.3.3             Security Assurance Requirements Rationale
[PP_BAC] section 6.3.3 “Security Assurance Requirements Rationale “ is applicable for this chapter.
[PP_EAC] and [PP_SAC] and their respective sections 6.3.3 “Security Assurance Requirements Rationale“ are
also applicable for this chapter with one additional rationale justifying the security assurance dependencies.
With the exception of ALC_DVS.2 and AVA_VAN.5, all assurance components are part of the EAL5 package,
which by package design does not have any dependency conflicts and is hierarchical to EAL4. The assurance
components ALC_DVS.2 and AVA_VAN.5 are also part of the assurance requirements from [PP_SAC], where
assurance dependencies are met as is shown in section 6.3.3 from [PP_SAC].
EAL5+ augmented with ALC_DVS.2 and AVA_VAN.5 is appropriate for this TOE, because this assurance level is
requested by several states. The assurance expectations for this kind of application are high due to the
sensitivity of data stored by the TOE. Therefore several governmental organizations request for an increased
assurance level.


7.3.4              Security Requirements – Internal Consistency
The rationale for the internal consistency of the SFRs from [PP_SAC], [PP_BAC] and [PP_EAC] section 6.3.4
“Security Requirements – Internal Consistency” are also applicable to this chapter.
The assurance package EAL5 and EAL4 are pre-defined sets of internally consistent assurance requirements.
The dependency analysis for the sensitive assurance components in [PP_SAC], [PP_EAC] and [PP_BAC] section
7.3.3 “Security Assurance Requirements Rationale” together with the additional rational from section 7.3.3
show that the assurance requirements are internally consistent as all (additional) dependencies are satisfied
and no inconsistency appears.
The rationale for internal consistency between functional and assurance requirements from [PP_SAC] ,
[PP_EAC] and and [PP_BAC] section 6.3.4 “Security Requirements – Internal Consistency” are also applicable to
this chapter.

    8             TOE Summary Specification
This TOE summary specification described in this section relies on the security services provided by the
platform product. For a description of these services please refer to [ST_JC_ID_S_Platform].
In the following each SFR is mentioned together with an indication for the PP from which these are originating
        -   (BAC) stands for SFRs originating from [PP_BAC].
        -   (SAC) stands for SFRs originating from [PP_SAC].
        -   (EAC) stands for SFRs originating from [PP_EAC]. Note that we include here also in this group the SFRs
            related to Active Authentication.
The composite TOE provides the security functions as follows:
       SF_EAC_PACE_BAC
The TOE implements the EAC, PACE and BAC protocol (PICC side). It encompasses:
        -   ECDH key generation, FCS_CKM.1/DH_PACE (SAC) and FCS_CKM.1/CA (EAC): The TOE uses the
            platform service “Elliptic Curves EC” for EC key generation. Further for session key generation the
            application uses the hybrid physical random number generator of the platform complying to PTG.3 as
            per [AIS31]. For the key generation the TOE supports “Generic Mapping” provided by the platform.
        -   Generation of Document Basic Access Keys, FCS_CKM.1 (BAC), FCS_COP.1/SHA (BAC): The TOE uses
            the cryptographic APIs provided by the underlying Secora ID S OS.
        -   Key destruction, FCS_CKM.4: The TOE uses the platform API ‘clearKey’ service to destroy session keys.
            The platform API ‘clearKey’ uses random numbers compliant to PTG.3 as per [AIS31] to overwrite the
            session keys.
        -   Provision of random numbers, as per FCS_RND.1. Authentication failure handling, FIA_AFL.1/PACE
            (SAC), FIA_AFL.1 (BAC): The TOE implements this check in such a way, that it withstands tearing events.
            A counter for unsuccessful authentication attempts is incremented before authentication is performed
            and reset in case of successful authentication.
        -   Prevention of replay attacks, FIA_UAU.4/PACE (EAC), FIA_UAU.4/PACE (SAC), FIA_UAU.4 (BAC):
            Replay attacks are prevented by the cryptographic protocol, which relies on good quality random
            numbers as required by FCS_RND.1 of this ST and supported by the underlying RNG of the platform and
            claimed in the ST of the platform with SFR FCS_RNG.1.
        -   Multiple authentication, FIA_UAU.5/PACE (EAC), FIA_UAU.5/PACE (SAC), FIA_UAU.5 (BAC): The TOE
            follows the protocol as described in [ICAO_SAC].
 SF_AA
  - Signature generation for the Active Authentication mechanism covered by FIA_API.1/AA,

   SF_SecureMessaging
    - Secure messaging, encryption/decryption, FCS_COP.1/PACE_ENC (SAC), FCS_COP.1/ENC (BAC): The
       TOE uses the proprietary PACE API from Secora ID S OS.
    - Secure messaging integrity protection, FCS_COP.1/PACE_MAC (SAC), FCS_COP.1/MAC (BAC): The TOE
       uses the underlying platform PACE dedicated API to calculate CMAC or Retail-MAC.
    - FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC (EAC), FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC (EAC) and FCS_COP.1/SIG_VER (EAC) are satisfied by
       using the standard Java Card API supported by the platform.
    - FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC (EAC) also covers to the GP scp03 used for secure card content management
       during personalization. This aspect of secure messaging by the TOE relies on the specially tailored API
       to GP SCP from the underlying platform and described in the SFR FCS_COP.1/SCP.
    - Multiple authentication, FIA_UAU.5/PACE (SAC), FIA_UAU.5 (BAC): The TOE performs a MAC check for
       every received message before instruction is executed, if the MAC check fails secure messaging is
       aborted; every response during secure messaging is MAC’ed by the TOE.
    - Re-authentication of terminal, FIA_UAU.6/EAC (EAC), FIA_UAU.6/PACE (SAC), FIA_UAU.6 (BAC): The
       TOE checks for every incoming message, whether the message is genuine (MAC check).
    - Trusted channel, FTP_ITC.1/PACE (SAC): The TOE follows the standardized implementation of the
       trusted channel according to [ICAO_SAC].

   SF_AccessControl
    - Allow specific access before user identification, FIA_UID.1/PACE (EAC), FIA_UID.1/PACE (SAC),
       FIA_UID.1 (BAC): The access rights information of the TOE grant access to EF.CardAccess (see
       [ICAO_9303_11]) and EF.ATR/INFO (see [ISO7816-4]) before PACE or BAC authentication is performed.
       The TOE allows to read a specific subset of initialization data.
    - Allow specific access before user authentication, FIA_UAU.1/PACE (EAC), FIA_UAU.1/PACE (SAC),
       FIA_UAU.1 (BAC): The access rights information of the TOE grant access to EF.CardAccess and
       EF.ATR/INFO before PACE or BAC authentication was performed. The TOE allows to read a specific
       subset of initialization data.
    - Subset and security attribute based access control, FDP_ACC.1/TRM (EAC), FDP_ACC.1/TRM (SAC),
       FDP_ACC.1 (BAC), FDP_ACF.1/TRM (EAC), FDP_ACF.1/TRM (SAC), FDP_ACF.1 (BAC), the TOE blocks
       access to EF.DG1, EF.DG2 and EF.DG5 to EF.DG16, EF.SOD and EF.COM, EF.DG3 and EF.DG4 in case BAC
       or PACE protocol is not successfully performed.
    - Residual information protection, FDP_RIP.1: as soon secure messaging is stopped, the whole secure
       messaging context including session keys is wiped with random numbers.
    - Data exchange confidentiality, FDP_UCT.1/TRM (SAC), FDP_UCT.1 (BAC): during secure messaging,
       responses by the ICC are always wrapped (encrypted and MAC’ed) before being sent.
    - Data exchange integrity, FDP_UIT.1/TRM (SAC), FDP_UIT.1 (BAC) : during secure messaging, responses
       by the ICC aCBC-CBC 112 bits,

4.3.2 Security Objectives Sufficiency

4.3.2.1   Countering of threats by security objectives:
T.SCD_Divulg (Storing, copying and releasing of the signature creation data) addresses the threat against
the legal validity of electronic signature due to storage and copying of SCD outside the TOE, as expressed in
the Directive [Directive], recital (18). This threat is countered by
- OE.SCD_Secrecy, which assures the secrecy of the SCD in the CSP environment, and
- OT.SCD_Secrecy, which assures the secrecy of the TÜV, TUEV and TUV are registered trademarks. Any use or application requires prior approval.

                                                                                            SCD during use by the TOE for signature creation.
Furthermore, generation and/or import of SCD known by an attacker is countered by
OE.SCD/SVD_Auth_Gen, which ensures that only authorised SCD generation in the environment is possible,
and OT.SCD_Auth_Imp, which ensures that only authorised SCD import is possible.
T.SCD_Derive (Derive the signature creation data) deals with attacks on the SCD via public known data
produced by the TOE, which are the SVD and the signatures created with the SCD. OE.SCD_Unique counters
this threat by implementing cryptographically secure generation of the SCD/SVD pair. OT.Sig_Secure en-
sures cryptographically secure electronic signatures.
T.Hack_Phys (Exploitation of physical vulnerabilities) deals with physical attacks exploiting physical vulner-
abilities of the TOE. OT.SCD_Secrecy preserves the secrecy of the SCD. OT.EMSEC_Design counters physical
attacks through the TOE interfaces and observation of TOE emanations. OT.Tamper_ID and
OT.Tamper_Resistance counter the threat T.Hack_Phys by detecting and by resisting tampering attacks.

NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 / SSCD with Key Import Security Target Lite


T.SVD_Forgery (Forgery of the signature verification data) deals with the forgery of the SVD given to the
CGA for certificate generation. T.SVD_Forgery is addressed by
         OE.SCD_SVD_Corresp, which ensures correspondence between SVD and SCD, and
         OE.SVD_Auth, which ensures the authenticity of the SVD given to the CGA of the CSP.

T.SigF_Misuse (Misuse of the signature creation function of the TOE) addresses the threat of misuse of the
TOE signature creation function to create SDO by others than the signatory to create SDO for data the sig-
natory has not decided to sign, as required by the Directive [Directive], Annex III, paragraph 1, literal (c).
OT.Lifecycle_Security, (Lifecycle security) requires the TOE to detect flaws during the initialisation, person-
alisation and operational usage including secure destruction of the SCD on demand of the signatory.
OT.Sigy_SigF (Signature creation function for the legitimate signatory only) ensures that the TOE provides
the signature creation function for the legitimate signatory only. OE.DTBS_Intend (Data intended to be
signed) ensures that the SCA sends the DTBS/R only for data the signatory intends to sign and
OE.DTBS_Protect counters manipulation of the DTBS during transmission over the channel between the SCA
and the TOE. OT.DTBS_Integrity_TOE (DTBS/R integrity inside the TOE) prevents the DTBS/R from alteration
inside the TOE. If the SCA provides the human interface for the user authentication, OE.HID_VAD (Protection
of the VAD) provides confidentiality and integrity of the VAD as needed by the authentication method em-
ployed. OE.Signatory ensures also that the signatory keep their VAD confidential.
T.DTBS_Forgery (Forgery of the DTBS/R) addresses the threat arising from modifications of the DTBS/R
sent to the TOE for signing which than does not correspond to the DTBS/R corresponding to the DTBS the
signatory intends to sign. The TOE IT environment addresses T.DTBS_Forgery by the means of
         OE.DTBS_Intend, which ensures that the SCA sends only those DTBS intended to be signed by the
          signatory, and
         OE.DTBS_Protect, which ensures that the DTBS/R cannot be altered in transit between the SCA
          and the TOE.

The TOE counters this threat by the means of OT.DTBS_Integrity_TOE by ensuring the integrity of the
DTBS/R inside the TOE.
T.Sig_Forgery (Forgery of the electronic signature) deals with non-detectable forgery of the electronic sig-
nature. OT.Sig_Secure, OE.SCD_Unique and OE.CGA_QCert address this threat in general. OT.Sig_Secure
(Cryptographic security of the electronic signature) ensures by means of robust cryptographic techniques
that the signed data and the electronic signature are securely linked together. OE.SCD_Unique ensures that
the same SCD cannot be generated more than once and the corresponding SVD cannot be included in
another certificate by chance. OE.CGA_QCert prevents forgery of the certificate for the corresponding SVD,
which would result in false verification decision concerning a forged signature.


4.3.2.2    Enforcement of OSPs by security objectives:
P.CSP_QCert (CSP generates qualified certificates) establishes the CSP generating qualified certificate or
non-qualified certificate linking the signatory and the SVD implemented in the SSCD under sole control of
this signatory. P.CSP_QCert is addressed by
         OT.Lifecycle_Security, which requires the TOE to detect flaws during the initialisation, personalisa-
          tion and operational usage,
         OE.SCD/SVD_Auth_Gen, which ensures that the SCD/SVD generation can be invoked by authorised
          users only,
         OT.SCD_Auth_Imp which ensures that authorised users only may invoke the import of the SCD,




                                                    41 of 82
NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 / SSCD with Key Import Security Target Lite


       OE.SCD_SVD_Corresp, which requires the CSP to ensure the correspondence between the SVD and
        the SCD during their generation, and
       OE.CGA_QCert for generation of qualified certificates or non-qualified certificates, which requires
        the CGA to certify the SVD matching the SCD implemented in the TOE under sole control of the
        signatory.
P.QSign (Qualified electronic signatures) provides that the TOE and the SCA may be employed to sign data
with an advanced electronic signature, which is a qualified electronic signature if based on a valid qualified
certificate. OT.Sigy_SigF ensures signatory's sole control of the SCD by requiring the TOE to provide the
signature creation function for the legitimate signatory only and to protect the SCD against the use of oth-
ers. OT.Sig_Secure ensures that the TOE creates electronic signatures, which cannot be forged without
knowledge of the SCD through robust encryption techniques. OE.CGA_QCert addresses the requirement of
qualified or non-qualified electronic certificates building a base for the electronic signature.
OE.DTBS_Intend ensures that the SCA provides only those DTBS to the TOE, which the signatory intends to
sign.
P.Sigy_SSCD (TOE as secure signature creation device) requires the TOE to meet the Annex II of the Di-
rective [Directive]. This is ensured as follows
       OE.SCD_Unique meets the paragraph 1(a) of the Directive [1], Annex III, by the requirements that
        the SCD used for signature creation can practically occur only once.
       OE.SCD_Unique, OT.SCD_Secrecy and OE.SCD_Secrecy meet the paragraph 1(a) of the Directive [1],
        Annex III, by the requirements to ensure the secrecy of the SCD. OT.EMSEC_Design and
        OT.Tamper_Resistance address specific objectives to ensure secrecy of SCD against specific attacks.
       OT.SCD_Secrecy and OT.Sig_Secure meet the paragraph 1(b) of the Directive [1], Annex III, by the
        requirements to ensure that the SCD cannot be derived from SVD, the digital signatures or any other
        data exported outside the TOE.
       OT.Sigy_SigF and OE.SCD_Secrecy meet the paragraph 1(c) of the Directive [1], Annex III, by the
        requirements to ensure that the TOE provides the signature creation function for the legitimate
        signatory only and protects the SCD against the use of others.
       OT.DTBS_Integrity_TOE meets the requirements the paragraph 2 of the Directive [1], Annex III, The
        TOE shall not alter the DTBS/R.
Please take note, the requirements of the Directive [Directive], Annex III, 2., that the SSCD does not prevent
the data to be signed from being presented to the signatory prior to the signature process is obviously
fulfilled by the method of TOE usage: the SCA will present the DTBS to the signatory and send them to the
SSCD for signing.
The usage of SCD under sole control of the signatory sole control is ensured by
       OT.Lifecycle_Security requiring the TOE to detect flaws during the initialisation, personalisation and
        operational usage
       OE.SCD/SVD_Auth_Gen, which limits invocation of the generation of the SCD and the SVD to au-
        thorised users only,
       OT.SCD_Auth_Imp, which limits SCD import to authorised users only,
       OE.SCD_Secrecy, which ensures the confidentiality of the SCD during generation and export to the
        TOE, and deletes the SCD after export to the TOE. The CSP does not use the SCD for signature crea-
        tion.
       OT.Sigy_SigF, which requires the TOE to provide the signature creation function for the legitimate
        signatory only and to protect the SCD against the use of others.

OE.SSCD_Prov_Service ensures that the signatory obtains an authentic copy of the TOE, initialised and per-
sonalised as SSCD from the SSCD-provisioning service.
P.Sig_Non-Repud (Non-repudiation of signatures) deals with the repudiation of signed data by the signa-
tory, although the electronic signature is successfully verified with the SVD contained in their certificate
valid at the time of signature creation. This policy is implemented by the combination of the security objec-
tives for the TOE and its operational environment, which ensures the aspects of signatory’s sole control
over and responsibility for the electronic signatures created with the TOE.
OE.SSCD_Prov_Service ensures that the signatory uses an authentic copy of the TOE, initialised and person-
alised for the signatory.
OE.SCD/SVD_Auth_Gen, OE.SCD_Secrecy and OE.SCD_Unique ensure the security of the SCD in the CSP
environment. OE.SCD_Secrecy ensures the confidentiality of the SCD during generation, during and after
export to the TOE. The CSP does not use the SCD for creation of any signature and deletes the SCD irrevers-
ibly after export to the TOE. OE.SCD_Unique provides that the signatory’s SCD can practically occur just
once. OE.SCD_SVD_Corresp ensures that the SVD in the certificate of the signatory corresponds to the SCD
that is implemented in the copy of the TOE of the signatory.
OE.CGA_QCert ensures that the certificate allows to identify the signatory and thus to link the SVD of the
signatory. OE.SVD_Auth and OE.CGA_QCert require the environment to ensure the authenticity of the SVD
as being exported by the TOE under sole control of the signatory. OE.CGA_QCert ensures that the certificate
allows to identify the signatory and thus to link the SVD of the signatory. OE.SVD_Auth and OE.CGA_QCert
require the environment to ensure the authenticity of the SVD as being exported by the TOE under sole
control of the signatory.
OE.Signatory ensures that the signatory checks that the SCD, stored in the SSCD received from an SSCD-
provisioning service is in non-operational state (i.e. the SCD cannot be used before the signatory becomes
into sole control over the SSCD). OT.Sigy_SigF provides that only the signatory may use the TOE for signature
creation. OE.DTBS_Intend, OE.DTBS_Protect and OT.DTBS_Integrity_TOE ensure that the TOE creates elec-
tronic signatures only for those DTBS/R, which the signatory has decided to sign as DTBS. The robust cryp-
tographic techniques required by OT.Sig_Secure ensure that only this SCD may create a valid electronic
signature that can be successfully verified with the corresponding SVD used for signature verification. The
security objective for the TOE OT.Lifecycle_Security (Lifecycle security), OT.SCD_Secrecy (Secrecy of the sig-
nature creation data), OT.EMSEC_Design (Provide physical emanations security), OT.Tamper_ID (Tamper
detection) and OT.Tamper_Resistance (Tamper resistance) protect the SCD against any compromise.



4.3.2.3   Upkeep of assumptions by security objectives:
A.SCA (Trustworthy signature creation application) establishes the trustworthiness of the SCA with respect
to generation of DTBS/R. This is addressed by OE.DTBS_Intend (Data intended to be signed) which ensures
that the SCA generates the DTBS/R of the data that have been presented to the signatory as DTBS and which
the signatory intends to sign in a form which is appropriate for being signed by the TOE.
A.CGA (Trustworthy certificate generation application) establishes the protection of the authenticity of
the signatory's name and the SVD in the qualified certificate by the advanced signature of the CSP by means
of the CGA. This is addressed by OE.CGA_QCert (Generation of qualified certificates), which ensures the
generation of qualified certificates, and by OE.SVD_Auth (CGA proves the authenticity of the SVD), which
ensures the verification of the authenticity of the received SVD and the correspondence between the SVD
and the SCD that is implemented by the SSCD of the signatory.
A.CSP (Secure SCD/SVD management by CSP) establishes several security aspects concerning handling of
SCD and SVD by the CSP. That the SCD/SVD generation device can only be used by authorised users is ad-
dressed by OE.SCD/SVD_Auth_Gen (Authorised SCD/SVD Generation), that the generated SCD is unique and
cannot be derived by the SVD is addressed by OE.SCD_Unique (Uniqueness of the signature creation data),

that SCD and SVD correspond to each other is addressed by OE.SCD_SVD_Corresp (Correspondence be-
tween SVD and SCD), and that the SCD are kept confidential, are not used for signature generation in the
environment and are deleted in the environment once exported to the TOE is addressed by OE.SCD_Secrecy
(SCD Secrecy).

5 Extended Component Definition

5.1 Definition of the Family FPT_EMS
The additional family FPT_EMS (TOE Emanation) of the Class FPT (Protection of the TSF) is defined here to
describe the IT security functional requirements of the TOE. The TOE shall prevent attacks against the SCD
and other secret data where the attack is based on external observable physical phenomena of the TOE.
Examples of such attacks are evaluation of TOE’s electromagnetic radiation, simple power analysis (SPA),
differential power analysis (DPA), timing attacks, radio emanation etc. This family describes the functional
requirements for the limitation of intelligible emanations. The family FPT_EMS belongs to the Class FPT
because it is the class for TSF protection. Other families within the Class FPT do not cover the TOE emana-
tion.

5.2 Definition of the Family FCS_RND
To define the IT security functional requirements of the TOE a sensitive family (FCS_RND) of the Class FCS
(cryptographic support) is defined here7. This family describes the functional FCS_RND is not limited to gen-
eration of cryptographic keys unlike the component FCS_CKM.1.
The family “Generation of random numbers (FCS_RND)” is specified as follows.

5.2.1 FCS_RND Generation of random numbers
Family behavior
This family defines quality requirements for the generation of random numbers which are intended to be
used for cryptographic purposes.

6 IT Security Requirements

6.1 General
This chapter gives the security functional requirements and the security assurance requirements for the
TOE.
Section 6.2 provides the security functional requirements.
The TOE security assurance requirements statement is given in section 6.3.


6.2 TOE Security Functional Requirements

6.2.1 Use of requirement specifications
The CC allows several operations to be performed on functional requirements; refinement, selection, as-
signment, and iteration are defined in paragraph C.4 of Part 1 [CC_1] of the CC. Each of these operations is
used in this ST and the underlying PP.
Operations already performed in the underlying PP [PP0075] are uniformly marked by bold italic font style;
for further information on details of the operation, please refer to [PP0075].
Operations performed within this security target are marked by bold underlined font style; further infor-
mation on details of the operation is provided in foot notes.

10   [assignment: cryptographic algorithm]
11   [assignment: cryptographic key sizes]
12   [assignment: list of standards]
 The combination of the two cryptographic algorithms with an „or“ is due to the fact that the final TOE
13

may be configured in a way that only one of the two cryptographic algorithms is activated.

Application note: The elliptic curves corresponding to the key sizes are defined in FCS_COP.0.1/SIG.
Application note: BSI-TR-03110 [TR03110] allows arbitrary combinations of ECC key sizes and AES key
lengths in the PACE protocol. It should be noted that ECC key lengths smaller than the AES key length will
lead to a reduced AES key space (e.g. a 224 bit entropy in a 256 bit AES key).


6.2.2.4       FCS_RND.1: Quality metric for random numbers
Hierarchical to:           No other components.
Dependencies:              No dependencies.
FCS_RND.1.1                The TSF shall provide a mechanism to generate random numbers that meet the
                           AIS20/31 Class DRG.3 quality metric14.


Application note: This SFR was added to the standard set of SFRs to address the requirements of the PACE
protocol. The random number generation is provided by the underlying NXP JCOP4 P71 platform.
Developer note: The corresponding platform SFR (FCS_RNG.1) states that the platform provides a deter-
ministic random number generator (RNG) that fulfills the following:
          (DRG.3.1) If initialized with a random seed using a PTRNG of class PTG.2 (as defined in [AIS20]) as
           random source, the internal state of the RNG shall have at least 256 bit of entropy.
          (DRG.3.2) The RNG provides forward secrecy (as defined in [AIS20]).
          (DRG.3.3) The RNG provides enhanced backward secrecy even if the current internal state is
           known (as defined in [AIS20])
          (DRG.3.4) The RNG, initialized with a random seed using a PTRNG of class PTG.2 (as defined in
           [AIS20]) as random source, generates output for which for AES-mode 248 and for TDEA-mode 235
           strings of bit length 128 are mutually different with probability at least 1 - 224.
          (DRG.3.5) Statistical test suites cannot practically distinguish the random numbers from output
           sequences of an ideal RNG. The random numbers must pass test procedure A (as defined in
           [AIS20]).

2.2.5 Assessment of Platform Organisational Security Policies
The Organisational Security Policy “OSP.VERIFICATION” focuses on the integrity of loaded applets, which is
fulfilled by the TOE of this ST since the applet is loaded secured by platform security measures into the flash
memory. This policy does not contradict to the policies of this ST.
The platform ST contains the Organisational Security Policy “OSP.PROCESS-TOE” referring to accurate iden-
tification of each TOE instance. This policy will be fulfilled by a distinct product code for the platform and
for the composite TOE each. This policy does not contradict to the policies of this ST.
The Organisational Security Policy “OSP.KEY-CHANGE” states that initial security domain keys (APSD) shall
be changed before any operation on its Security Domain. This policy does not contradict to the policies of
this ST.
The Organisational Security Policy “OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS” states that security domains can be dynami-
cally created, deleted and blocked during usage phase in post-issuance mode. This policy does not contra-
dict to the policies of this ST.
The Organisational Security Policy “OSP.SECURE-BOX” focuses on the secure box mechanism, which is not
used by the TOE. This policy does not contradict to the policies of this ST.

2.2.6.1   Assessment of Platform Assumptions

In the first column, the following table lists all assumptions of the Platform ST. The last column provides an
explanation of relevance for the Composite TOE.


 Platform Assumption                  Relevance for Composite ST
 A.APPLET                             A.APPLET states that applets loaded post-issuance do not contain na-
                                      tive methods. This assumption leads to appropriate directives in the
                                      user guidance [Guidance].
 A.VERIFICATION                       This assumption targets the applet code verification. Regarding post-
                                      issuance loading of third party applets, this assumption leads to ap-
                                      propriate directives in the user guidance [Guidance].
 A.USE_DIAG                           A.USE_DIAG is required in the platform ST to cover secure communi-
                                      cation during packaging, finishing and personalisation. This is re-
                                      flected by appropriate measures in the production and delivery of the
                                      TOE of this ST.
 A.USE_KEYS                           A.USE_KEYS assumes that that the keys which are stored outside the
                                      TOE and which are used for secure communication and authentica-
                                      tion between smart card and terminals are protected for confidenti-
                                      ality and integrity in their own storage environment.
                                      This assumption leads to appropriate directives in the user guidance
                                      [Guidance].
 A.PROCESS-SEC-IC                     A.PPROCESS-SEC-IC of the platform ST states that it is assumed that
                                      security procedures are used after delivery of the TOE by the TOE
                                      Manufacturer up to delivery to the end consumer to maintain confi-
                                      dentiality and integrity of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test
                                      data (to prevent any possible copy, modification, retention, theft or
                                      unauthorised use). This means that the phases after TOE delivery are
                                      assumed to be protected appropriately.
                                      This is reflected by appropriate measures in the production and deliv-
                                      ery of the TOE of this ST.
 A.APPS-PROVIDER                      A.APPS-PROVIDER assumes that the application provider is a trusted
                                      actor that provides basic or secure applications, and that the ap-
                                      plicatrion provider is resposible for his security domain keys.
                                      This leads to appropriate directives in the user guidance [Guidance].
 A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY             A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY assumes that the verification authority is
                                      a trusted actor and able to guarantee and check the digital signature
                                      attached to a basic or secure application. This is reflected by appro-

3 Security problem definition
This chapter has been taken from [PP0075] with minor modifications.


3.1 Assets, users and threat agents
The Common Criteria define assets as entities that the owner of the TOE presumably places value upon. The
term “asset” is used to describe the threats in the operational environment of the TOE.
Assets and objects:
    1. SCD: private key used to perform an electronic signature operation. The confidentiality, integrity
       and signatory’s sole control over the use of the SCD must be maintained.
    2. SVD: public key linked to the SCD and used to perform electronic signature verification. The integrity
       of the SVD when it is exported must be maintained.
    3. DTBS and DTBS/R: set of data, or its representation, which the signatory intends to sign. Their in-
       tegrity and the unforgeability of the link to the signatory provided by the electronic signature must
       be maintained.
User and subjects acting for users:
    1. User: End user of the TOE who can be identified as Administrator or Signatory. The subject S.User
       may act as S.Admin in the role R.Admin or as S.Sigy in the role R.Sigy.
    2. Administrator: User who is in charge to perform the TOE initialisation, TOE personalisation or other
       TOE administrative functions. The subject S.Admin is acting in the role R.Admin for this user after
       successful authentication as Administrator.
    3. Signatory: User who hold the TOE and use it on their own behalf or on behalf of the natural or legal
       person or entity they represent. The subject S.Sigy is acting in the role R.Sigy for this user after
       successful authentication as Signatory.
Threat agents:
    1. Attacker: Human or process acting on their behalf located outside the TOE. The main goal of the
       attacker is to access the SCD or to falsify the electronic signature. The attacker has got a high attack
       potential and knows no secret.


3.2 Threats

3.2.1 T.SCD_Divulg: Storing, copying, and releasing of the signature-creation data
An attacker stores or copies the SCD outside the TOE. An attacker can obtain the SCD during generation,
storage and use for signature-creation in the TOE.

3.2.2 T.SCD_Derive: Derive the signature-creation data
An attacker derives the SCD from publicly known data, such as SVD corresponding to the SCD or signatures
created by means of the SCD or any other data exported outside the TOE, which is a threat against the
secrecy of the SCD.

3.2.3 T.Hack_Phys: Physical attacks through the TOE interfaces
An attacker interacts physically with the TOE to exploit vulnerabilities, resulting in arbitrary security com-
promises. This threat is directed against SCD, SVD and DTBS.

3.2.4 T.SVD_Forgery: Forgery of the signature-verification data
An attacker forges the SVD presented by the CSP to the CGA. This results in loss of SVD integrity in the
certificate of the signatory.

3.2.5 T.SigF_Misuse: Misuse of the signature-creation function of the TOE
An attacker misuses the signature-creation function of the TOE to create a SDO for data the signatory has
not decided to sign. The TOE is subject to deliberate attacks by experts possessing a high attack potential
with advanced knowledge of security principles and concepts employed by the TOE.

3.2.6 T.DTBS_Forgery: Forgery of the DTBS/R
An attacker modifies the DTBS/R sent by the SCA. Thus the DTBS/R used by the TOE for signing does not
match the DTBS the signatory intended to sign.

3.2.7 T.Sig_Forgery: Forgery of the electronic signature
An attacker forges a signed data object, maybe using an electronic signature which has been created by the
TOE, and the violation of the integrity of the signed data object is not detectable by the signatory or by third
parties. The signature created by the TOE is subject to deliberate attacks by experts possessing a high attack
potential with advanced knowledge of security principles and concepts employed by the TOE.


3.3 Organisational Security Policies

3.3.1 P.CSP_QCert: Qualified certificate
The CSP uses a trustworthy CGA to generate a qualified certificate or non-qualified certificate ([Directive]:
2:9, Annex I) for the SVD. The certificates contain at least the name of the signatory and the SVD matching
the SCD implemented in the TOE under sole control of the signatory. The CSP ensures that the use of the
TOE as SSCD is evident with signatures through the certificate or other publicly available information.

3.3.2 P.QSign: Qualified electronic signatures
The signatory uses a signature-creation system to sign data with an advanced electronic signature ([Di-
rective]: 1, 2), which is a qualified electronic signature if it is based on a valid qualified certificate ([Directive],
Annex I). The DTBS are presented to the signatory and sent by the SCA as DTBS/R to the SSCD. The SSCD
creates the electronic signature c                                     Developer. Such software is required for testing purpose
                                                                                     (IC Dedicated Test Software) but may provide additional

6.1.5                  Memory access control
Usage of multiple applications in one Smartcard often requires code and data separation in order to prevent
that one application can access code and/or data of another application. For this reason the TOE provides Area
based Memory Access Control. The underlying Memory Protection Unit (MPU) is documented in Appendix B3.5
of the ARMv7 M architecture reference manual [ARMv7M].
In particular, the MPU provides full support for:
 Protection regions.
 Overlapping protection regions, with ascending region priority:
  − Region 7 = highest priority.
  − Region 0 = lowest priority.
 Access permissions.
   MPU mismatches and permission violations invoke the programmable-priority MemManage fault handler.

The MPU can be used to:
   Enforce privilege rules, preventing user applications from corrupting operating system data.
   Separate processes, blocking the active task from accessing other tasks’ data.
   Enforce access rules, allowing memory regions to be defined as read-only or detecting unexpected memory
    accesses.

The SFRs are provided by the Memory Access Control Policy (FDP_ACC.1 and dependencies).


6.1.5.1                Subjects, objects and operations of the Memory Access Control Policy

 MPU

 MPU enable/disable bit.
 8 regions with the following attributes
    − a unique priority
    − the enable bit
    − the xn (execute never) bit
    − the start address and size
    − an access matrix which defines if an Operation of the MPU (Subject) to a memory/code address (Object)
     lying in the region is allowed or denied
 A bit defining the acces behavior of the default region, i.e. memory/code addresses not covered by one of the
  8 MPU regions.


Security Attributes for objects:
There are no security attributes for objects.


6.1.5.3            Access control rules of the Memory Access Control Policy
The following generic rules shall apply in case the MPU is enabled. In case the MPU is disabled, a privileged and
unprivileged code has full read/write/execute rights to all addresses.
 If an address is contained in multiple enabled regions, then the region with the highest priority defines the
    access rights.
   If an address is contained in no region then the default region defines the access rights.
   The region defining the access rights checks if the Subject has access to the Object with respect to the desired
    Operation. In case the access is denied the MPU throws an access violation exception. The checks are done
    according to the access matrix inTable 21.
   overlapping regions, have access to other regions with ascending region priority:
    region 7 = highest priority, region 0 = lowest priority
   execution of code is bound to the read access of Table 21 and the xn bit. If the xn bit is cleared and read
    access is enabled then execution of code is defined by Table 21. If the xn bit is set then execution is never
    allowed.

                              additional rules: none5.

Note:          The security functional requirements FIA_API.1, FTP_ITC.1, FDP_UCT.1, FDP_UIT.1, FDP_ACC.1/Loader
               and FDP_ACF.1/Loader apply only to TOE products with activated Flash Loader. In other cases the
               Flash Loader is not available anymore and the user data download is completed.

The following SFRs have been added to the SFRs from Flash Loader package 2 of [PP0084] in order to describe
the management of the various Flash Loader authentication keys.

Note:          The Administrator User can manage the keys for Administration User, Download Operator User and
               Image Provider. The Download Operator User can delete the key for Image Provider and Download
               Operator, otherwise manage the keys for the Download Operator User only. The image provider cannot
               modify any keys or perform authentication with the Flash Loader. It can simply built authentic
               loadable images.

Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)

6.2.1.1              Implementation representation (ADV_IMP)
The refinement of [PP0084] requires the evaluator to check for completeness. In case of ADV_IMP.2 the entire
implementation representation has to be provided anyhow. A check for completeness is also applicable in case
the entire implementation representation is provided.

6.2.1.2              Life cycle support (ALC_CMS)
The refinement from [PP0084] can also be applied to the assurance level EAL 6 augmented with ALC_CMS.5.
The assurance package ALC_CMS.4 is extended to ALC_CMS.5 with aspects regarding the configuration control
system for the TOE. The refinement is still valid.

6.2.1.3              Configuration management capabilities (ALC_CMC)
The refinement from [PP0084] details, how configuration management has to be also applied to production.
This is also applicable for ALC_CMC.5. ALC_CMC.5 is not specifically focused on production.

6.2.1.4              Test Coverage (ATE_COV)
The refinement in [PP0084] clarifies, how to deal with testing of security mechanisms for physical protection. It
further requests the TOE to be tested under different operating conditions. These refinements are also
applicable for ATE_COV.3, which requires complete TSFI coverage.

6.2.1.5              Functional Specification (ADV_FSP)
The refinement from [PP0084] can also be applied to the assurance level EAL 6 augmented with ADV_FSP.5. The
assurance package ADV_FSP.4 is extended to ADV_FSP.5 with aspects regarding the level of description.
ADV_FSP.5 requires a semi-formal description in addition. The refinement is still valid.
For refinement details see [PP0084].

6.2.2                Security policy model details
EAL6 requires the development of a formal security policy model of the TSF, and establishing a correspondence
between the functional specification and this security policy model. Preserving internal consistency the
security policy model is expected to formally establish the security principles from its characteristics by means
of a mathematical proof.

                      communication protocol of the TOE is standardized in either ISO7816 [31] (T=1, T=0),
                      ISO14443 [32] (T=CL), or UM10204 [33] (I2C Slave).
                      The second group of users are administrators of cards. They want to configure the
                      card by using the Configuration Module, to install additional applets and to configure and
                      personalise these applets. These users require the same equipment as end-users.
                      The third group of users wants to develop Java Card applets and execute them on
                      the TOE. These applet developers need in addition to the communication device a
                      set of tools for the development of applets. This set of tools can be obtained from the
                      TOE vendor and comprises elements such as PC development environment, byte code
                      verifier, compiler, linker and debugger.

                     1.3 TOE Description

                    1.3.1 TOE Components and Composite Certification
                           The certification of this TOE is a composite certification. The following sections provide
                           a more detailed description of the components of Figure 1. It is also made clear whether
                           a component is covered by a previous certification or whether it is covered in the
                           certification of this TOE.

                  1.3.1.1 Micro Controller

                           The Micro Controller is a secure smart card controller from NXP’s SmartMX3 family.
                           The Micro Controller contains a co-processor for symmetric cryptographic operations,
                           supporting DES and AES, as well as an accelerator for asymmetric cryptographic
                           algorithms. The Micro Controller further contains a physical random number generator.
                           The supported memory technologies are volatile (Random Access Memory (RAM)) and
                           non-volatile (Read Only Memory (ROM) and FLASH) memory.
                           Access to all memory types is controlled by a Memory Management Unit (MMU) which
                           allows to separate and restrict access to parts of the memory.
                           The Micro Controller has been certified in a previous certification and the results are re-
                           used for this certification. The exact reference to the previous certification is given in the
                           following Table 2 "Reference to Certified Micro Controller":

                 1.3.1.2.1 MC FW (Micro Controller Firmware)

                           The Micro Controller Firmware is used for testing of the Micro Controller at production,
                           for booting of the Micro Controller after power-up or after reset, for configuration of

                 1.3.1.2.2 Crypto Library

                           The Crypto Library provides implementations for symmetric and asymmetric
                           cryptographic operations, hashing, the generation of hybrid deterministic and hybrid
                           physical random numbers and further functions like secure copy and compare.
                           Some of the cryptographic algorithms offered by the Crypto Lib are not certified, see
                           Section 1.3.1.4 "Excluded functionality".
                           The symmetric cryptographic operations comprise the algorithms 3DES and AES. These
                           algorithms use the symmetric co-processor of the Micro Controller.

                 1.3.1.3.1 JCOP 4.7 SE051

                          The OS of the TOE consists of JCVM, JCRE, JCAPI and GP framework. It is
                          implemented according to the Java Card Specification and GlobalPlatform. Additionally it
                          consists of a proprietary API, which is described in the UGM [9].
                          The TOE can be identified by using the IDENTIFY APDU command (see UGM [9]). This
                          command returns the card identification data, which includes a Platform ID, a Patch ID
                          and other information that allows to identify the content in ROM, FLASH and loaded
                          patches (if any).
                          The TOE also includes a Configuration Module (see Section 1.3.2 "Optional TOE
                          Functionality") which is used for personalisation and configuration of the TOE. It must be
                          deleted after the personalisation is finished (end of Phase 6 ”Personalisation”) by using
                          the DELETE APDU command. Once the Configuration Module is deleted, it is no longer
                          possible to configure the TOE.
                          The TOE contains further functionality for integrity protection of user data via an
                          EDC, encryption of user data via PUF [12] and optional functionality as described in
                          Section 1.3.2 "Optional TOE Functionality".

                  1.3.1.4 Excluded functionality

                          All Secure Box Native Libraries are not part of the TOE. No security functional
                          requirements are claimed on AES CCM, HMAC, HKDF, ECDAA, elliptic curve
                          cryptography based on Edwards and Montgomery curves and FIPS self-tests, they are
                          TSF non-interfering.

                                                                                • SmartCard product delivery to the SmartCard end-user,
                                                                                  and the end of life process.
                                                                                • applets may be loaded onto the chip.

                      The evaluation process is limited to phases 1 to 5. User Applet development is outside
                      the scope of this evaluation. Applets can be loaded into FLASH in phases 3, 4, 5, and 6.
                      Applet loading in phase 7 is also allowed. This means post-issuance loading of applets
                      can be done for a certified TOE.
                      The Configuration Module is loaded into FLASH and has special privileges to personalize
                      and configure the TOE. Before life cycle Phase 7 "Operational Use" the Configuration
                      Module is deleted and hence it is ensured that its functionality cannot be used
                      afterwards. It is possible to load patch code into FLASH in phases 3, 4, 5, and 6. The
                      certification is only valid for the ROM code having the Platform Identifiers and the Patch
                      IDs (if applicable) as stated in Table 5 "Delivery Items".
                      The delivery process from NXP to their customers (to phase 4 or phase 5 of the life
                      cycle) guarantees that the customer is aware of the exact versions of the different parts
                      of the TOE as outlined above.

                         TOE documentation is delivered in electronic form (encrypted according to defined
                         mailing procedures).
                         Note: Phases 1 to 3 are under the TOE developer scope of control. Therefore, the
                         objectives for the environment related to phase 1 to 3 are covered by Assurance
                         measures, which are materialized by documents and procedures evaluated through the
                         TOE evaluation process.
                         During phases 4 to 7 the TOE is no more under the developer control. In this
                         environment, the TOE protects itself with its own Security functions. But some additional
                         usage procedures must also be followed in order to ensure that the TOE is correctly
                         and securely handled, and not damaged or comprised. This ST assumes (A.USE_
                         DIAG, A.USE_KEYS) that users handle securely the TOE and related Objectives for the
                         environment are defined (OE.USE_DIAG, OE.USE_KEYS).

                 1.3.5.2 TOE Identification

                         The TOE can be identified by using the Platform ID, the FLASH ID and the Patch ID. The
                         IDENTIFY command and the identification output for this TOE are described in detail
                         in Chapter 2 of the UGM [9]. The IDENTIFY command also returns information about
                         presence of optional functionality and allows to identify the IOT Full and IOT Reduced
                         base mask configuration.

                  1.3.6 Evaluated Package Types
                         A number of package types are supported for this TOE. All package types, which are
                         covered by the certification of the used hardware (see [10]), are also allowed to be used
                         in combination with each product of this TOE.
                         The package types do not influence the security functionality of the TOE. They only
                         define which pads are connected in the package and for what purpose and in which
                         environment the chip can be used. Note that the security of the TOE is not dependent on

6.3.3.1.1 Rationale for the exclusion of Dependencies


The dependency FMT_MSA.3 of FDP_ACF.1/TRM is discarded. The access
  control TSF according to FDP_ACF.1/TRM uses security attributes which are
  defined during the personalisation and are fixed over the whole life time of the
  TOE. No management of these security attribute (i.e. SFR FMT_MSA.1 and
  FMT_MSA.3) is necessary here.

6.3.4 Rationale for the Security Assurance Requirements
The EAL5 was chosen to permits a developer to gain maximum assurance from
positive security engineering based upon rigorous commercial development
practices supported by moderate application of specialist security engineering
techniques. Such a TOE will probably be designed and developed with the intent
of achieving EAL5 assurance. It is likely that the additional costs attributable to
the EAL5 requirements, relative to rigorous development without the applicati                                                                         20 / 120

    2.4         TOE Overview

2.4.1               TOE Definition
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) addressed by this ST is an electronic passport representing a smart card
implementing [ICAO_9303_10], [ICAO_9303_11], [TR-03110_1] and [TR-03110_3]. This smart card / passport
provides the following application:
     the travel document containing the related user data as well as data needed for authentication with BAC,
     PACE, EAC or AA protocols (incl. PACE/BAC passwords); this application is intended to be used by
     governmental organisations as a machine readable travel document (MRTD).
For the ePassport application, the travel document holder can control access to his user data by conscious
presenting his travel document to governmental organisations.The travel document’s chip is integrated into a
physical (plastic or paper), optically readable part of the travel document, which – as the final product – shall
eventually supersede still existing, merely optically readable travel documents. The plastic or paper, optically
readable cover of the travel document, where the travel document’s chip is embedded in, is not part of the
TOE. The tying-up of the travel document’s chip to the plastic travel document is achieved by physical and
organizational security measures being out of scope of the TOE.

2.4.2               TOE Operational Usage
A State or Organization issues MRTDs to be used by the holder for international travel. The traveler presents a
MRTD to the inspection system to prove his or her identity. The MRTD in context of this ST contains (i) visual
(eye readable) biographical data and portrait of the holder, (ii) a separate data summary (MRZ data) for visual
and machine reading using OCR methods (see [ICAO_9303_01]) in the Machine readable zone (MRZ) and (iii)
data elements on the MRTD’s chip. The authentication of the traveller is based on (i) the possession of a valid
travel document personalised for a holder with the claimed identity as given on the biographical data page and
(ii) biometrics using the reference data stored in the travel document. The issuing State or Organisation ensures
the authenticity of the data of genuine travel documents. The receiving State trusts a genuine travel document
of an issuing State or Organisation.

2.4.3               TOE Major Security Features
The following TOE security features are the most significant for its operational use:
    Verifying authenticity and integrity as well as securing confidentiality of user data in the communication
     channel between the TOE and the connected terminal supporting the protocols BAC, SAC(PACE) as per
     [ICAO_9303_11] and EAC as per [TR-03110_1]
    Averting of inconspicuous tracing of the travel document as per [TR-03110_1]
    Self-protection of the TOE security functionality and the data stored inside as per [TR-03110_1]
    Means to check authenticity of the terminal, Terminal Authentication as per [TR-03110_1]
    Means to prove authenticity of the chip by means of Active Authentication or Chip Authentication as per [TR-
     03110_1]
    Chip authentication followed by terminal authentication used as a precondition to provide access to
     biometric data known as EAC, as per [TR-03110_1]

 2.6              TOE Description

2.6.1               Component Overview
The TOE is a DI chip with the ePassport configuration of SECORA™ ID S Infineon Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0.
It is based on the requirements from the ICAO for machine readable travel documents, i.e. [ICAO_9303_10],
[ICAO_9303_11], [TR-03110_1] and [TR-03110_3].
Figure 1 shows the TOE in terms of its components.
The grey color indicates what contributes to fulfill the security claims in this ST. The white color indicates
optional components which are not in the scope of the security claims of this ST, in CC terminology these are
non interefering with the TSF of the TOE.
   -    The two lower layers in the picture represent the smart card controller referenced by IFX_CCI_000005
        together with the Firmware, Asymmetric Cryptographic Library (ACL) and a Symmetric Crypto Library
        (SCL). Note that these components are certified by the same CC certificate BSI-DSZ-CC-1110-V2-2019.
        The hardware platform provides effective protection mechanisms against fault attacks. The platform
        contains hardware co-processors, which support cryptographic standards such as TDES, AES, RSA and
        EC. The hardware co-processor SCP has integrated measures against successful SCA.
   -    The OS platform called “Secora ID S” is a Java Card OS and offers services for:
                 The standard Java Card features like API, the Java Card Runtime Environment and the Java
                  Card Virtual Machine
               Proprietary PACE API providing special countermeasures against side channel leakage
               GP for content management
               Crypto operations (hash, EC, RSA, TDES and AES)
               Communication via the contactless interface and contact interface.
        It is certified in Common Criteria under the Certificate NSCIB-CC-175887.
        Secora ID S supports the standard open Java Card mode as well as the proprietary static mode
        (installation of preloaded code is possible) and the proprietary mode native (specially tailored mode for
        eMRTD usecase which enforces non traceablity of the TOE). Open and static modes are the two possible

       modes during personalization of the TOE. The TOE goes into native mode once the personalization is
       terminated. See [ST_JC_ID_S_Platform] for more details on the supported modes in Secora ID S OS.
   -   ISO or EU Electronic Driving License (eDL) or an Electronic ID(eID) are configurations of SECORA™ ID S
       Applet Infineon Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0. For more information on these optional features refer
       to [UserGuideDataBook], [UserGuideAdmin]. As already said these applications are not part of the TOE
       Security Functionalities and are non interfering with the TSFs of the TOE. The installation of eDL and
       eID is done by the customer who uses the cap file of SECORA™ ID S Applet Infineon Applet Collection
       preloaded on the card by Infineon. Again, no claims of the security for the eDL or the eID applications
       are made in this ST.
   -   ePassport configuration of SECORA™ ID S Applet Infineon Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0 is a Java Card
       applet which provides the functions of the electronic Passport as per [ICAO_9303_10], [ICAO_9303_11],
       [TR-03110_1] and [TR-03110_3].
       The installation of ePass is done by the customer who uses for this purpose the cap file of SECORA™ ID
       S Applet Infineon Applet Collection preloaded on the card by Infineon.
       The applet uses the services of the Java Card Secora ID S OS described above. It manages the various
       stages of the product’s lifecycle once the application is onto the hardware up to its end of life. The
       application implements the protocols:
                 BAC
                 PACE
                 EAC
                 AA
       It does not implement any cryptographic primitives, as these are provided by the underlying Java Card
       OS. Further it manages file access control and authentication failure handling. Also the application
       controls the secure messaging including error handling using the Java Card OS Crypto services, which
       subsequently relies on the features of the underlying hardware providing high integrity and side
       channel protection. The claims in terms of SFRs in this ST target the SECORA™ ID S Applet Infineon
       Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0.

   -   Third party applications can be installed by the customer and running on the card. Note that in this
       case the JC Secora ID S is delivered in open mode, see [ST_JC_ID_S_Platform] to the customer which
       will be then able to load and install 3rd party applications.
The TOE user guidance comprises:
   -   [UserGuideDataBook] and [UserGuideAdmin] which provide guidance, how to perform personalization
       and maintain the targeted security level during Personalisation and Operation phase.

2. Manufacturing
   - Step 3: manufacturing of IC and IC dedicated software. As the TOE does not provide any user ROM,
       manufacturing of IC embedded software parts in ROM are not relevant here.
   - Step 4 (optional): Combination of IC with contactless interface of the travel document
   - Step 5 (Prepersonalization): loading on the device of the executable Java Card OS image. Loading of
       the application JC package containing the TOE code, eDL and eID code.
3. Personalisation of Travel Document
   - Step 6: this step is performed by the customer. The customer receives from Infineon the TOE
       composed of the following components:
           o The underlying hardware
           o The underlying Java Card OS can be in two possible modes: either in the standard Java Card
                open mode (loading and installation of applets are possible) or in the proprietary Java Card
                static mode (preloaded by Infineon packages can be installed, applet loading is not possible).
           o The cap file of SECORA™ ID S Applet Infineon Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0 is preloaded by
                Infineon.
           o The customer then proceeds to installing the ePassport configuration of SECORA™ ID S Infineon
                Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0 and optionally installing the ISO/EU eDL or eID. In case the
                Secora ID S is in open mode the customer can load and install 3rd party applets. During this step
                the customer also performs the personalisation with biometric data and configuration of the
                TSF if necessary.
4. Operational Use
   - Step 7: once the personalization of the product is finished, the Java Card ID S OS is switched to its
       proprietary native mode usage of the TOE by the personalizer. Native mode switches off GP and
       identification commands to disallow tracking of the end user.

  7             Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)

  7.1           TOE Security Functional Requirements
 The security functional requirements (SFR) for this TOE are defined in this chapter.
This ST covers the three PPs [PP_SAC], [PP_EAC] and [PP_BAC] each two of which have a non empty
intersection of SFRs. In the rest of this section we provide a classification of the SFRs of these PPs depending on
where these SFRs are declared and if they need a refinement here in this ST.
 Table 1 lists all SFRs appearing both in [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC].
 Table 2 lists all SFRs declared in [PP_SAC].
Table 3 lists all SFRs specific to [PP_BAC]. Note that some of the SFRs appear in both [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC]
with same name but different content. In such cases the SFR is iterated with either the extension …/BAC or
…/PACE.
Table 4 lists all SFRs specific to [PP_EAC]. Note that [PP_EAC] is an extension of [PP_SAC], therefore all SFRs of
[PP_SAC] are SFRs in [PP_EAC], i.e. the SFRs listed in Table 3 and Table 4 are also SFRs of [PP_EAC].
Table 5 lists the SFRs introduced in this ST which are related to the Active Authentication mechanism
supported by the TOE.

Note that if an SFR has application notes as per the PPs [PP_SAC], [PP_EAC] and [PP_BAC] then these
application notes apply and can be found in the respective PPs.
Some SFRs contain additional application notes to ease the understanding of the specificities gf this TOE.

                           [PP_SAC] provides more detailed requests, when the session keys have to be
                           destroyed. Therefore FCS_CKM.4 from [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC] can be combined.

                       packages. Modules can only be deleted, re-loading of a previously deleted module or
                       replacing a present module must not be possible. Interfaces to a Module can be Public
                       or TOE internal. Public Interfaces can directly be accessed by any Applet or via an
                       APDU, TOE internal interfaces can only be accessed by the TOE itself, Applets use the
                       corresponding JavaCard API [14].

                 3.3.2 SA.MODULE-INVOCATION: Module Invocation
                       Invoking a module must be transparent to the user. If a Module has a TOE internal
                       interface, is not present and is invoked by the user, the TOE must preserve a secure
                       state by throwing an exception or returning an appropriate error status word to the CAD.

4       Security Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)
                       The Security Problem Definition is described within the following sections. Only additional
                       and refined items compared to the PP [6] are described.

                  4.1 Assets
                       Assets are security-relevant elements to be directly protected by the TOE. Confidentiality
                       of assets is always intended with respect to un-trusted people or software, as various
                       parties are involved during the first stages of the smart card product life-cycle. Details
                       concerning the threats are given in Section 4.2 "Threats" hereafter.
                       Assets have to be protected, some in terms of confidentiality and some in terms of
                       integrity or both integrity and confidentiality. These assets might get compromised by the
                       threats that the TOE is exposed to.
                       The assets to be protected by the TOE are listed below. They are grouped according to
                       whether it is data created by and for the user (User data) or data created by and for the
                       TOE (TSF data). This definition of grouping is taken from Section 5.1 of [6].

                                                          with the AP. These keys can be used to load and install applications
