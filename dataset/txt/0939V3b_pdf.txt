                                                                                                                      Security Target Lite



                       The IC hardware platform P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF is a microcontroller
                       incorporating a central processing unit, memories accessible via a Memory Management
                       Unit, cryptographic coprocessors, other security components and two communication
                       interfaces. The central processing unit supports a 32-/24-/16-/8-bit instruction set optimized
                       for smart card applications, which is a super set of the 80C51 family instruction set. The first
                       and in some cases the second byte of an instruction are used for operation encoding. On-
                       chip memories are ROM, RAM and EEPROM. The non-volatile EEPROM can be used as
                       data or program memory. It consists of high reliable memory cells, which guarantee data
                       integrity. The EEPROM is optimized for applications requiring reliable non-volatile data
                       storage for data and program code. EEPROM double read function is included for correct
                       memory readout. Dedicated security functionality protects the contents of all memories.
                       The security functionality of the TOE is designed to act as an integral part of a complete
                       security system in order to strengthen the design as a whole. Several security mechanisms
                       are completely implemented in and controlled by the TOE. Other security mechanisms allow
                       for configuration or even require handling of exceptions by the Security IC Embedded
                       Software. The different CPU modes and the Memory Management Unit support the
                       implementation of multi-application projects using the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF.
                       A Security IC must provide high security in particular when being used in the banking and
                       finance market, in electronic commerce or in governmental applications because the TOE
                       is intended to be used in a potential insecure environment. Hence the TOE shall maintain
                           • the integrity and the confidentiality of code and data stored in its memories and
                           • the different CPU modes with the related capabilities for configuration and memory
                             access and
                           • the integrity, the correct operation and the confidentiality of security functionality
                             provided by the TOE.
                       This is ensured by the construction of the TOE and its security functionality.
                       P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF basically provides a hardware platform for an
                       implementation of a smart card application with
                           • functionality to calculate the Data Encryption Standard (Triple-DES) with up to three
                             keys,
                           • functionality to calculate the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with different key
                             lengths,
                           • support for large integer arithmetic operations like multiplication, addition and logical
                             operations, which are suitable for public key cryptography and elliptic curve
                             cryptography,
                           • a True Random Number Generator,
                           • memory management control,
                           • cyclic redundancy check (CRC) calculation,
                           • ISO/IEC 7816 contact interface with UART,
                           • ISO/IEC 14443 A contactless interface.
                       In addition, several security mechanisms are implemented to ensure proper operation as
                       well as integrity and confidentiality of stored data. For example, this includes security
                       mechanisms for memory protection and security exceptions as well as sensors, which allow

                       and chip shielding is added to the chip.
                       Note:        Large integer arithmetic operations are intended to be used for calculation of
                                    asymmetric cryptographic algorithms. Any asymmetric cryptographic
                                    algorithm utilizing the support for large integer arithmetic operations has to be
                                    implemented in the Security IC Embedded Software. Thus, the support for
                                    large integer arithmetic operations itself does not provide security functionality
                                    like cryptographic support. The Security IC Embedded Software implementing
                                    an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm is not included in this evaluation.
                                    Nevertheless the support for large integer arithmetic operations is part of the
                                    Security IC and therefore a security relevant component of the TOE, that must
                                    resist to the attacks mentioned in this Security Target and that must operate
                                    correctly as specified in the data sheet. The same scope of evaluation is
                                    applied to the CRC calculation.


                  1.3.2 TOE type
                       The P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF is provided as IC hardware platform for various

                       by the Security IC Embedded Software.
                       The Firmware Operating System for the hardware platform is called the Plain Firmware
                       Operating System (FOS-Plain) and the Firmware Operating System for the MIFARE
                       Software Emulation is called the Emulation Firmware Operating System (FOS- Emu).
                       The FOS-Plain provides an interface for programming of the internal EEPROM memory,
                       which is mandatory for use by the Security IC Embedded Software when programming the
                       EEPROM memory. Furthermore FOS-Plain provides an interface for the Post Delivery
                       Configuration functionality.
                       All configurations other than P60D024/016/012P include emulation MIFARE Plus
                       MF1PLUSx0 or MIFARE DESFire EV1 in the FOS-Emu. These emulations are represented
                       by the term MIFARE Software in this document. Note that MIFARE Software is not part of
                       the TOE (see Fig 2).

                              Release VB(Y) can be identified by ROM Code number xxx in the range of 005 to 013 and 092 to 095. All
                                 other ROM Code numbers are assigned to version VB(Z) and VB(A). The ROM code number can
                                 unambiguously identified by reading Security Row bytes RCN0 (DFFF8A) and RCN1 (DFF8B), see [9].
                                 In addition the ROM Code number is physically visible on the dice surface according to [12]. Releases
                                 VB(Z), and VB(A) share the same underlying hardware, but were adapted for yield improvement
                                 compared to VB(Y). Compared to Release VB(Z) the release VB(A) introduces additional configuration
                                 option. Releases VB(Z), and VB(A) can be distinguished by the Device Coding of “NXP option of
                                 PATDET configuration selection” in DC4 (“initial” for VB(Z), “a” for VB(A), see [9].

                            other ROM Code numbers are assigned to version VB(Z) and VB(A). The ROM code number can
                            unambiguously identified by reading Security Row bytes RCN0 (DFFF8A) and RCN1 (DFF8B), see [9].
                            In addition, the ROM Code number is physically visible on the dice surface according to [12]. Releases
                            VB(Z), and VB(A) share the same underlying hardware, but were adapted for yield improvement
                            compared to VB(Y). Compared to Release VB(Z) the release VB(A) introduces additional configuration
                            option. Releases VB(Z), and VB(A) can be distinguished by the Device Coding of “NXP option of
                            PATDET configuration selection” in DC4 (“initial” for VB(Z), “a” for VB(A), see [9].

                         Release VF contains update of for EEPROM start-up circuit for yield improvement. Release VF can be
                            identified by check of the silicon version code VMSK according to section 4.2 in [12]: h46 for VF
                            (others have VMSK value: h42).

                           The version of the Security IC Dedicated Software specified in Table 3, Table 4 and Table
                           5 can be identified by the Security IC Embedded Software by reading out the ROM Code
                           Number (RCN) as defined in [9], section 31.2.1. Furthermore, the version of the Firmware
                           Operating System as part of the Security IC Dedicated Support Software can be read-out
                           by Security IC Embedded Software using FVEC interface as specified in [9], section 13.4.1
                           Emulation Control Interface (FVEC0).


                 1.4.2 Evaluated configurations
                           The customer can select different logical configurations of the TOE. The configuration
                           options are structured as major and minor configuration options.


                 1.4.2.1        Major configuration options
                           The major configurations of the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF are given in Table 1. All
                           major configurations are equipped with an EEPROM of 24 kBytes and both, the ISO/IEC
                           7816 contact interface and the ISO/IEC 14443 contactless interface. Their major differences
                           are related to the availability of EEPROM space. The ‘024’, ‘016’ and ‘012’ specify the
                           accessible EEPROM memory.
                           The ‘y’ indicates the selection of the Firmware Operating System (FOS). It is a placeholder for
                           either ‘P’, ‘M’ or ‘D’:
                                  •    ‘P’ indicates the absence of FOS-Emu
                                  •    ‘M’ indicates FOS-Emu with MIFARE Plus MF1PLUSx0
                           7
                               Version 06.12 and version 06.13 include extensions on top of
                                  9047A_BM097_TESTROM_v1_btos_08v0A_fos_6v10.hex stored in Firmware Mode EEPROM.
                                  Choice of FOS version is dependent of “NXP option for EEPROM characteristics” in OEF, see [9].
                                  Hardware VB(Y) is restricted to Version 06.12 only.

                       The FOS-Emu including MIFARE Software is not part of the Evaluation.
                       Nine major configurations are present, which are denoted by the names P60D024P,
                       P60D016P, P60D012P, P60D024M, P60D016M, P60D012M, P60D024D, P60D016D and
                       P60D012D (see Table 1). The major configurations provide different versions of the IC
                       Dedicated Test Software and the IC Dedicated Support Software (see Table 3, Table 4
                       and Table 5).
                       One major difference between the major configurations is related to the availability of
                       EEPROM space to the Security IC Embedded Software:

                                   Table 7).
                       Each major configuration is provided with several minor configuration options, which are
                       introduced in Section 1.4.2.2. Each major configuration also provides customers with
                       several options for reconfiguration (Post Delivery Configuration), which are described in
                       Section 1.4.2.3 in detail.

                1.4.2.2     Minor configuration options
                          Minor configuration options can be selected by the customer via Order Entry Forms [13],
                          [14] and [15]. The first seven characters in the name of a major configuration give the type
                          name and therewith the Order Entry Form belonging to. The Order Entry Form identifies the
                          minor configuration options, which are supported by a major configuration out of those
                          introduced in Table 1.

                          Table 8. The availability of minor configuration options partly depends on the selected major
                          configuration option. However, in general the minor configuration options can be chosen
                          independently.
                1.4.2.3     Post Delivery Configuration
                          Post Delivery Configuration (PDC) can be applied by the customer himself after the TOE
                          has been delivered to that customer. These options can be used to tailor the TOE to the
                          specific customer requirements. The Post Delivery Configuration can be changed multiple
                          times but must be set permanently by the customer before the TOE is delivered to phase 7
                          of the life cycle.
                          The Post Delivery Configuration for the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF is listed in Table
                          9.

                          By applying Post Delivery Configuration the Security Rows content is updated for the
                          changed configuration options and can therefore be used for identification of the TOE after
                          applying any Post Delivery Configuration. Further details regarding Security Rows content
                          and identification of the TOE after applying Post Delivery Configuration refer to [9].
                          The Post Delivery Configuration can be accessed using chip health mode functionality in
                          combination with the ISO/IEC 7816 contact interface.
                1.4.2.4         Evaluated package types
                          A number of package types are supported for each major configuration of the TOE. The
                          commercial types are named according to the following format.
                            • P60D024ypp(p)/9Brrff(o) for major configuration P60D024PVB(Y/Z/A)/MVB(Y/Z/A)
                            • P60D016ypp(p)/9Brrff(o) for major configuration P60D016PVB(Y/Z/A)/MVB(Y/Z/A)
                            • P60D012ypp(p)/9Brrff(o) for major configuration P60D012PVB(Y/Z/A)/MVB(Y/Z/A)
                            • P60D024ypp(p)/9Frrff(o) for major configuration P60D024yVF
                            • P60D016ypp(p)/9Frrff(o) for major configuration P60D016yVF
                            • P60D012ypp(p)/9Frrff(o) for major configuration P60D012yVF
                          The commercial type name of each major configuration varies with the package type as
                          indicated by the variable pp and with the Security IC Embedded Software as indicated by
                          the variables rr and ff. Variable y identifies the activation of the firmware emulations.
                          Variable o identifies the EEPROM size of MIFARE Software. The number 9 is used as Fab
                          identifier and B/F references to the silicon version also available at major configuration
                          naming as VB/VF. The variables are replaced according to the rules in Table 10.

                                                 ‘M’ for MIFARE Plus.
                           pp(p)                 Package delivery type (alpha numeric, last character optional), e.g. “A4” for
                                                 MOB4 module.
                           rr                    ROM code number, which identifies the ROM mask.

                       For example, commercial type name P60D024PX0/9Brrff denotes major configuration
                       P60D024yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF in PDM1.1 dual interface smart card module. The characters ‘rr’
                       and ‘ff’ are individual for each customer product.
                       The package types do not influence the security functionality of the TOE. They only define
                       which pads are connected in the package and for what purpose and in which environment
                       the chip can be used. Note that the security of the TOE is not dependent on which pad is
                       connected or not - the connections just define how the product can be used. If the TOE is
                       delivered as wafer the customer can choose the connections on his own.
                       Security during development and production is ensured for all package types listed above,
                       for details refer to section 1.4.4.
                       The commercial type name identifies major configuration and package type of the TOE as
                       well as the Security IC Embedded Software. However, the commercial type name does not
                       itemize the minor configuration options of the TOE, which are introduced in section 1.4.2.2.
                       Instead, minor configuration options are identified in the Order Entry Form, which is
                       assigned to the ROM code number and the FabKey number of the commercial type name.

                  1.4.3 Logical Scope of TOE
                1.4.3.1     Hardware Description
                          The CPU of the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF supports a 32-/24-/16-/8-bit instruction
                          set and distinguishes five CPU modes, which are summarized in Table 12.

                          Table 12.    CPU modes of the TOE
                                            Super System Mode
                           Boot Mode            Test Mode                            Firmware Mode                     System Mode        User Mode

                          Boot Mode, Test Mode and Firmware Mode are sub-modes of the so-called Super System
                          Mode. These three modes are not available to the Security IC Embedded Software; they
                          are reserved for the Security IC Dedicated Software. The Security IC Dedicated Software is
                          composed of Security IC Dedicated Test Software and Security IC Dedicated Support
                          Software, (Boot-ROM Software and Firmware Operating System) as introduced in section
                          1.4.1. The three software components are mapped one-to-one to the three CPU modes: In
                          Boot Mode the TOE executes the Boot-ROM Software, in Test Mode the TOE executes the
                          IC Dedicated Test Software and in Firmware Mode the TOE executes the Firmware
                          Operating System. Please note that the Super System Mode is not a mode on its own:
                          When the TOE is in Super System Mode, it is always either in Boot Mode, Test Mode or
                          Firmware Mode.
                          The P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF is able to control two different logical phases. After
                          production of the Security IC every start-up or reset completes with Test Mode and
                          execution of the IC Dedicated Test Software. The Test Mode is disabled at the end of the
                          production test. Afterwards, every start-up or reset ends up in System Mode and execution
                          of the Security IC Embedded Software.
                          In case the minor configuration option ‘Post Delivery Configuration’ is enabled and not finally
                          locked by the customer, the resource configuration functionality allows the customer to
                          enable or disable specific functionality of the hardware platform, refer to Table 9.
                          In case the minor configuration option ‘Chip Health/Ident Mode’ is enabled, during the boot
                          process routines either starting built-in self tests checking the functional integrity of the TOE
                          or sending back identification items of the TOE can be activated by the user.
                          System Mode and User Mode are available to the developer of the Security IC Embedded
                          Software. System Mode has unlimited access to the hardware components available to the
                          Security IC Embedded Software. User Mode has restricted access to the CPU, specific
                          Special Function Registers and the memories depending on the access rights granted by
                          software running in System Mode. The hardware components are controlled by the Security
                          IC Embedded Software via Special Function Registers. Special Function Registers are
                          interrelated to the activities of the CPU, the Memory Management Unit, interrupt control, I/O
                          configuration, EEPROM, timers, UART, the contactless interface and the coprocessors.

NXP Semiconductors                                            P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF
                                                                                                                    Security Target Lite



                       The P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF provides two types of interrupts: (i) exception
                       interrupts, called “exception” in the following and (ii) event interrupts, called “interrupts” in
                       the following. Exceptions and interrupts each force a jump to a specific fixed vector address
                       in the ROM. Any exception and interrupt can therefore be controlled and guided by a specific
                       part     of     the    Security     IC     Embedded       Software.      In     addition,    the
                       P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF provides eight firmware vectors (FVEC) and 32 system
                       call vectors (SVEC). These vectors have to be explicitly called by the Security IC Embedded
                       Software. A jump to a firmware vector forces Firmware Mode and starts execution of the
                       Firmware Operating System, a jump to a system call vector forces System Mode.
                       The Watchdog timer is intended to abort irregular program executions by a time-out
                       mechanism and is enabled and configured by the Security IC Embedded Software.
                       The P60D024yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF incorporates 352 kBytes of ROM, 8.125 kBytes of RAM and
                       24 kBytes of EEPROM. Access control to all three memory types is enforced by a Memory
                       Management Unit. The Memory Management Unit partitions each memory into two parts:
                       The ROM is partitioned in 264 kBytes Application-ROM and 88 kBytes Test-ROM. 512
                       Bytes of the EEPROM are always reserved for the manufacturer area, 768 Bytes are always
                       reserved for IC Dedicated Support Software. The Security IC Dedicated Support Software
                       contains functionality for programming the user EEPROM which must be called by the
                       Security IC Embedded Software. Therefore, the Security IC Dedicated Support Software
                       has access also to the EEPROM area which is allocated to the Security IC Embedded
                       Software, the separation between user data and NXP firmware data is guaranteed by
                       means of a software firewall. 512 Bytes of RAM is allocated for the Firmware Operating
                       System and the remaining part for the application. Note that the ROM size is displayed as
                       264 kBytes in the block diagram in Fig 1 because only 264 kBytes are available to the
                       Security IC Embedded Software.
                       In Test Mode the CPU has unrestricted access to all memories. In Boot Mode and Firmware
                       Mode access is limited to the Test-ROM, the manufacturer area of the EEPROM and its
                       configured part of 768 Bytes as well as the configured part of 512 Bytes RAM for the
                       Firmware Operating System. All other parts of the memories are accessible in System Mode
                       and User Mode, namely the Application-ROM and the larger parts of EEPROM and RAM.
                       User Mode is further restricted by the Memory Management Unit, which can be configured
                       in System Mode.
                       The RAM, which is available to the Security IC Embedded Software, is further split in two
                       parts. These are 5.0 kBytes general purpose RAM (CXRAM) and 2.625 kBytes FXRAM
                       (associated to the Fame2 coprocessor). Both parts are accessible to the CPU, but the
                       Fame2 coprocessor can only access the FXRAM. The Fame2 coprocessor can access the
                       FXRAM without control of access rights by the Memory Management Unit. Since the
                       Memory Management Unit does not control accesses of the Fame2 coprocessor, software
                       which has access to the Fame2 coprocessor implicitly has access to the FXRAM.
                       The Triple-DES coprocessor supports single DES and Triple-DES operations. Only Triple-
                       DES is in the scope of this evaluation, in 2-key or 3-key operation with two/three 56-bit keys
                       (112-/168-bit). The AES coprocessor supports AES operation with three different key
                       lengths of 128, 192 or 256 bits. The Fame2 coprocessor supplies basic arithmetic functions
                       to support implementation of asymmetric cryptographic algorithms by the Security IC
                       Embedded Software. The random generator provides true random numbers without pseudo
                       random calculation. The CRC coprocessor provides CRC generation polynomial CRC-16

                          and CRC-32. The copy machine supports a mechanism to transfer data between specific
                          Special Function Registers as well as memories without interaction of the CPU.
                          The P60D024yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF operates with a single external power supply of 1.8 V, 3 V or
                          5 V nominal. Alternatively, the P60D024yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF can be supplied via the RF
                          interface by inductive coupling. The maximum external clock frequency used for
                          synchronization of the ISO/IEC 7816 communication is 10 MHz nominal, the CPU and all
                          co-processors are supplied exclusively with an internally generated clock signal which
                          frequency can be selected by the Security IC Embedded Software. The
                          P60D024yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF provides power saving modes with reduced activity. These are
                          named IDLE Mode and SLEEP Mode, of which the latter one includes CLOCK STOP Mode.
                          The TOE protects secret data, which are stored to and operated by the TOE, against
                          physical tampering. A memory encryption is added to the memories RAM, ROM and
                          EEPROM. EEPROM double read function is included in this memory to check data
                          consistency during EEPROM read. Chip shielding is added in form of active and passive
                          shield over logic and memories. Sensors in form of light, voltage, temperature and
                          frequency sensors are distributed over the chip area. The security functionality of the IC
                          hardware platform is mainly provided by the TOE, and completed by the Security IC
                          Embedded Software. This causes dependencies between the security functionality of the
                          TOE and the security functionality provided by the Security IC Embedded Software.


                1.4.3.2     Software Description
                          Operating system and applications of a Security IC are developed by the customers and
                          included under the heading Security IC Embedded Software. The Security IC Embedded
                          Software is stored in the Application-ROM and/or in the EEPROM and is not part of the
                          TOE. The Security IC Embedded Software depends on the usage of the IC hardware
                          platform.
                          The Security IC Dedicated Test Software, is stored to the Test-ROM and used by the
                          manufacturer of the Security IC during production test. The test functionality is disabled
                          before the TOE is delivered (operational use of the Security IC) by disabling the Test Mode
                          of the CPU in hardware. The Security IC Dedicated Test Software is developed by NXP and
                          embedded in the Test-ROM. The Security IC Dedicated Test Software includes the test
                          operating system, test routines for the various blocks of the circuitry, control flags for the
                          status of the EEPROM’s manufacturer area and shutdown functions to ensure that security
                          relevant test routines can not be executed illegally after phase 3.
                          The TOE consists of the Security IC hardware, the IC Dedicated Software and the
                          associated documentation. The following Fig 2 shows the logical boundary of the
                          hardware platform with the IC Dedicated Software.

                  1.4.4 Security during Development and Production
                       The Security IC product life-cycle is scheduled in phases as introduced in the PP [6]. IC
                       Development as well as IC Manufacturing and Testing, which are phases 2 and 3 of the life-
                       cycle, are part of the evaluation. Phase 4 the IC Packaging is also part of the evaluation.
                       The Security IC is delivered at the end of phase 3 or phase 4 in the life-cycle. The
                       development and production environment of the TOE ranges from phase 2 to TOE Delivery.
                       With respect to Application Note 3 in [6] the TOE supports the authentic delivery using the
                       “Chip Health/Ident Mode” and the FabKey feature. For further details on these features
                       please refer to the data sheet [9] and the guidance and operation manual [11].
                       During the design and the layout process only people involved in the specific development
                       project for an IC have access to sensitive data. Different people are responsible for the
                       design data and for customer related data.
                       The production of the wafers includes two different steps regarding the production flow. In
                       the first step the wafers are produced with the fixed masks independent of the customer.
                       After that step the wafers are completed with the customer specific mask, including the ROM
                       Code, and the remaining mask set.
                       The test process of every die is performed by a test centre of NXP. Delivery processes
                       between the involved sites provide accountability and traceability of the TOE. NXP embeds
                       the dice into modules, inlays or packages based on customer demand. Information about
                       non-functional items is stored on magnetic/optical media enclosed with the delivery or the
                       non-functional items are physically marked. In summary, the TOE can be delivered in four
                       different forms, which are
                           • dice on wafers
                           • smartcard modules on a module reel
                           • inlays
                           • packaged devices in tubes or reels
                       The availability of major configuration options of the TOE in package types is detailed in
                       section 1.4.2.4.


                  1.4.5 TOE Intended Usage
                       The end-consumer environment of the TOE is phase 7 of the Security IC product life-cycle
                       as defined in the PP [6]. In this phase the Security IC product is in usage by the end-
                       consumer. Its method of use now depends on the Security IC Embedded Software. The
                       Security ICs including the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF can be used to assure
                       authorized conditional access in a wide range of applications. Examples are identity cards,
                       Banking Cards, Pay-TV, Portable communication SIM cards, Health cards and
                       Transportation cards. The end-user environment covers a wide spectrum of very different
                       functions, thus making it difficult to monitor and avoid abuse of the TOE. The TOE is
                       intended to be used in an insecure environment, which does not protect against threats.
                       The device is developed for most high-end safeguarded applications, and is designed for
                       embedding into chip cards according to ISO/IEC 7816 [23] and for contactless applications
                       according to ISO/IEC 14443 [25]. Usually a Security IC (e.g. a smartcard) is assigned to a
                       single individual only, but it may also be used by multiple applications in a multi-provider

                       environment. Therefore, the TOE might store and process secrets of several systems, which
                       must be protected from each other. The TOE then must meet security requirements for each
                       single security module. Secret data shall be used as input for calculation of authentication
                       data, calculation of signatures and encryption of data and keys.
                       In development and production environment of the TOE the Security IC Embedded Software
                       developer and system integrators such as the terminal software developer may use samples
                       of the TOE for their testing purposes. It is not intended that they are able to change the
                       behaviour of the Security IC in another way than an end-consumer.
                       The user environment of the TOE ranges from TOE delivery to phase 7 of the Security IC
                       product life-cycle, and must be a controlled environment up to phase 6.
                       Note:           The phases from TOE Delivery to phase 7 of the Security IC Product life-cycle
                                       are not part of the TOE construction process in the sense of this Security
                                       Target. Information about these phases is just included to describe how the
                                       TOE is used after its construction. Nevertheless, such security functionality of
                                       the TOE, that is independent of the Security IC Embedded Software, is active
                                       at TOE Delivery and can not be disabled by the Security IC Embedded
                                       Software in the following phases.


                  1.4.6 Interface of the TOE
                       The electrical interface of the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF are the pads to connect
                       the lines power supply, ground, reset input, clock input, serial communication pad I/O1 and
                       depending on a minor configuration option TP1 and TP2, as well as two pads (called LA
                       and LB) for the antenna of the RF interface. Communication with the TOE can be
                       established via the contact interface through the ISO/IEC 7816 UART or direct usage of the
                       I/O ports. Contactless communication is done via the contactless interface unit (CIU)
                       compatible to ISO/IEC 14443.
                       The logical interface of the TOE depends on the CPU mode and the associated software.
                           • In Boot Mode the Boot-ROM Software is executed. Only in case the minor configuration
                             option “Chip Health/Ident Mode” is enabled, starting of built-in self test routines and
                             read-out of TOE identification items is supported. If this minor configuration option is
                             disabled the Boot-ROM Software provides no interface. In this case there is no
                             possibility to interact with this software.
                           • In Test Mode (used before TOE delivery) the logical interface visible on the electrical
                             interface is defined by the Security IC Dedicated Test Software. This Security IC
                             Dedicated Test Software comprises the test operating system and the package of test
                             function calls.
                           • In Firmware Mode the Firmware Operating System is executed by the CPU. The
                             Firmware Mode is always requested by the Security IC Embedded Software.
                           • In System Mode and User Mode (after TOE Delivery) the software interface is the set
                             of instructions, the bits in the special function registers that are related to these modes
                             and the physical address map of the CPU including memories. The access to the
                             special function registers as well as to the memories depends on the CPU mode
                             configured by the Security IC Embedded Software.

                           Note:    The logical interface of the TOE that is visible on the electrical interface after
                                    TOE Delivery is based on the Security IC Embedded Software developed by
                                    the software developer. The identification and authentication of the user in
                                    System Mode or User Mode must be controlled by the Security IC Embedded
                                    Software.
                       The chip surface can be seen as an interface of the TOE, too. This interface must be taken
                       into account regarding environmental stress e.g. like temperature and in the case of an
                       attack, for which the attacker manipulates the chip surface.
                       Note:        An external voltage and timing supply as well as a logical interface are
                                    necessary for the operation of the TOE. Beyond the physical behaviour the
                                    logical interface is defined by the Security IC Embedded Software.

2. Conformance Claims
                       This chapter is divided into the following sections: “CC Conformance Claim”, “Package
                       claim”, “PP claim” and “Conformance Claim Rationale”.

                 2.1 CC Conformance Claim
                       This Security Target and the TOE claims to be conformant to version 3.1 of Common Criteria
                       for Information Technology Security Evaluation according to
                           • “Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation Part 1: Introduction
                             and general model, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April 2017, CCMB-2017-04-001” [1]
                           • “Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation Part 2: Security

                           • “Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation Part 3: Security
                             assurance components, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April 2017, CCMB-2017-04-003” [3]
                       The following methodology will be used for the evaluation.
                           • “Common Methodology for Information Technology Security Evaluation: Evaluation
                             Methodology, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April 2017, CCMB-2017-04-004” [4]
                       This Security Target and the TOE claims to be CC Part 2 extended and CC Part 3
                       conformant. The extended Security Functional Requirements are defined in Chapter 5.



                 2.2 Package claim
                       This Security Target claims conformance to the assurance package EAL6 augmented. The
                       augmentation to EAL6 is ALC_FLR.1. In addition, the assurance package of this Security
                       Target is augmented using the component ASE_TSS.2, which is chosen to include
                       architectural information on the security functionality of the TOE.
                       Note:          The PP “Security IC Protection Profile” [6] to which this Security Target claims
                                      conformance (for details refer to section 2.3) requires assurance level EAL4
                                      augmented. The changes, which are needed for EAL6, are described in the
                                      relevant sections of this Security Target.
                       The level of evaluation and the functionality of the TOE are chosen in order to allow the
                       confirmation that the TOE is suitable for use within devices compliant with the German
                       Digital Signature Law.



                 2.3 PP claim
                       This Security Target claims strict conformance to the Protection Profile (PP) “Security IC
                       Platform Protection Profile, Version 1.0, registered and certified by Bundesamt für
                       Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) under the reference BSI-PP-0035” [6].
                       Since the Security Target claims conformance to this PP [6], the concepts are used in the
                       same sense. For the definition of terms refer to the PP [6]. These terms also apply to this
                       Security Target.

                       The TOE provides additional functionality, which is not covered in the PP [6]. In accordance
                       with Application Note 4 of the PP [6], this additional functionality is added using the policy
                       “P.Add-Components” (see Section 3.3 of this Security Target for details).



                 2.4 Conformance Claim Rationale
                       According to Section 2.3, this Security Target claims strict conformance to the PP “Security
                       IC Protection Profile [6].
                       The TOE type defined in section 1.3.2 of this Security Target is a smartcard controller. This
                       is consistent with the TOE definition for a Security IC in section 1.2.2 of [6].
                       All sections of this Security Target, in which security problem definition, objectives and
                       security requirements are defined, clearly state which of these items are taken from the PP
                       [6] and which are added in this Security Target. Therefore, this is not repeated here.
                       Moreover, all additionally stated items in this Security Target do not contradict the items
                       included from the PP (see the respective sections in this document). The operations done
                       for the SFRs taken from the PP [6] are also clearly indicated.
                       The evaluation assurance level claimed for this target (EAL6+) is shown in section 6.2 to
                       include respectively exceed the requirements claimed by the PP [6] (EAL4+).
                       These considerations show that the Security Target correctly claims strict conformance to
                       the PP [6].

3. Security Problem Definition
                       This Security Target claims conformance to the PP “Security IC Protection Profile” [6].
                       Assets, threats, assumptions and organisational security policies are taken from the PP [6].
                       This chapter lists these assets, threats, assumptions and organisational security policies,
                       and describes extensions to these elements in detail.
                       The chapter is divided into the following sections: “Description of Assets”, “Threats”,
                       “Organisational Security Policies” and “Assumptions”.

                 3.1 Description of Assets
                       Since this Security Target claims strict conformance to the PP “Security IC Protection
                       Profile” [6] the assets defined in section 3.1 of [6] are applied here. These assets are cited
                       below.
                       The assets related to standard functionality are:
                           • integrity and confidentiality of User Data stored and in operation,
                           • integrity and confidentiality of Security IC Embedded Software, stored and in operation,
                           • correct operation of the security services and restricted hardware resources provided
                             by the TOE for the Security IC Embedded Software.
                       To be able to protect these assets the TOE shall protect its security functionality. Therefore,
                       critical information about the TOE shall be protected. Critical information includes:
                           • logical design data, physical design data, Security IC Dedicated Software, configuration
                             data,
                           • Initialisation Data and Pre-personalisation Data, specific development aids, test and
                             characterisation related data, material for software development support, photomasks.
                       Note that the keys for the cryptographic calculations using cryptographic coprocessors are
                       seen as User Data.

                 3.2 Threats
                       Since this Security Target claims strict conformance to the PP “Security IC Protection
                       Profile” [6] the threats defined in section 3.2 of [6] are valid for this Security Target. The
                       threats defined in the PP [6] are listed below in Table 13.

                       Considering Application Note 5 in [6] the TOE provides additional functionality to protect
                       against threats that may occur if the hardware platform is used for multiple applications. The
                       TOE provides access control to the memories and to hardware resources providing security
                       services for the software.
                       The Security IC Embedded Software controls all User Data stored by the TOE. If multiple
                       applications are running on the TOE the User Data may belong to different applications.
                       The access to User Data from application A by the application B contradicts the separation
                       between the different applications and is considered as threat. The User Data is stored in
                       the memory and processed by the hardware resources.
                       The TOE shall avert the threat “Unauthorised Memory or Hardware Access
                       (T.Unauthorised-Access)” as specified below.
                       T.Unauthorised-Access                     Unauthorised Memory or Hardware Access

                                 Adverse action:                An attacker may try to read, modify or execute code or data
                                                                stored in restricted memory areas. And or an attacker may try
                                                                to access or operate hardware resources that are restricted by

                       Access restrictions for the memories and hardware resources accessible by the Security

                                                                                                                      Security Target Lite



                       The TOE provides specific security functionality, which can be used by the Security IC
                       Embedded Software. In the following, specific security functionality is listed, which is not
                       derived from threats identified for the TOE’s environment. It can only be decided in the
                       context of the application against which threats the Security IC Embedded Software will use
                       this specific security functionality.
                       The IC Developer/Manufacturer therefore applies the policy “Additional Specific Security
                       Components (P.Add-Components)” as specified below.
                       P.Add-Components                         Additional Specific Security Components
                                                                The TOE shall provide the following additional security
                                                                functionality to the Security IC Embedded Software:
                                                             • Triple-DES encryption and decryption
                                                             • AES encryption and decryption
                                                             • Integrity support of data stored in EEPROM
                                                             • Post Delivery Configuration: reconfiguration of customer
                                                               selectable options as listed in Table 9 (for the
                                                               P60D024yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF,P60D016yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF, and

                 3.4 Assumptions
                       Since this Security Target claims strict conformance to the PP “Security IC Protection
                       Profile” [6] the assumptions defined in section 3.4 of [6] are valid for this Security Target.
                       The following table lists these assumptions.

                       Table 15.     Assumptions defined in the PP [6]

                       The following assumptions are added in this Security Target according to Application Notes
                       7 and 8 in [6].
                       A.Check-Init                             Check of initialisation data by the Security IC Embedded

                                                                The Security IC Embedded Software must provide a function to
                                                                check initialisation data. The data is defined by the customer and
                                                                injected by the TOE Manufacturer into the non-volatile memory
                                                                to provide the possibility for TOE identification and for
                                                                traceability.
                       The following additional assumption considers specialised encryption hardware of the TOE.
                       The developer of the Security IC Embedded Software must ensure the appropriate “Usage
                       of Key-dependent Functions (A.Key-Function)” while developing this software in Phase 1
                       as specified below.

                       Clarification of “Usage of Hardware Platform (OE.Plat-Appl)”
                       The TOE supports cipher schemes as additional specific security functionality. If required
                       the Security IC Embedded Software shall use these cryptographic services of the TOE and
                       their interface as specified. When key-dependent functions implemented in the Security IC
                       Embedded Software are just being executed, the Security IC Embedded Software must
                       provide protection against disclosure of confidential data (User Data) stored and/or
                       processed in the TOE by using the methods described under “Inherent Information
                       Leakage (T.Leak-Inherent)” and “Forced Information Leakage (T.Leak-Forced)“.
                       If the Random Number Generator is used for leakage countermeasures, cryptographic
                       operations (e.g. key generation) or cryptographic protocols (e.g. challenge response) these
                       random numbers must be tested appropriately.
                       For multi-applications the Security IC Embedded Software (Operating System) can
                       implement a memory management scheme based upon security functionality of the TOE
                       to ensure the separation of applications.
                       Clarification of “Treatment of User Data (OE.Resp-Appl)”
                       By definition cipher or plain text data and cryptographic keys are User Data. The Security
                       IC Embedded Software shall treat these data appropriately, use only proper secret keys
                       (chosen from a large key space) as input for the cryptographic function of the TOE and
                       use keys and functions appropriately in order to ensure the strength of cryptographic
                       operation.
                       This means that keys are treated as confidential as soon as they are generated. The keys
                       must be unique with a very high probability, as well as cryptographically strong. For
                       example, if asymmetric algorithms are used, it must be ensured that it is not possible to
                       derive the private key from a related public key using the attacks defined in this Security
                       Target. If keys are imported into the TOE and/or derived from other keys, quality and
                       confidentiality must be maintained. This implies that appropriate key management has to
                       be realised in the environment.
                       The treatment of User Data is also required when a multi-application operating system is
                       implemented as part of the Security IC Embedded Software on the TOE. In this case the
                       multi-application operating system will not disclose security relevant user data of one
                       application to another application when it is processed or stored on the TOE.

                 4.3 Security Objectives for the Operational Environment
                       The following security objectives for the operational environment are specified according
                       to the PP “Security IC Protection Profile” [6].

                        Security objective   Description                                 Applies to phase ...
                           OE.Process-Sec-IC           Protection during composite product                            TOE delivery up to the end
                                                       manufacturing                                                  of phase 6

                       Check of initialisation data
                       The TOE provides specific functionality that requires the TOE Manufacturer to implement
                       measures for the unique identification of the TOE. Therefore, OE.Check-Init is defined to
                       allow a TOE specific implementation (refer also to A.Check-Init).

                 4.4 Security Objectives Rationale
                       Section 4.4 in the PP “Security IC Protection Profile” [6] provides a rationale how the
                       assumptions, threats, and organisational security policies are addressed by the objectives
                       that are specified in the PP [6]. Table 19 reproduces the table in section 4.4 of [6].

                       Table 20 provides the justification for the additional security objectives. They are in line
                       with the security objectives of the PP [6] and supplement these according to the additional

                       (T.Unauthorised-Access)” is as follows:
                       According to O.FM_FW, O.MEM_ACCESS and O.SFR_ACCESS the TOE must enforce
                       the partitioning of memory areas in Firmware Mode, System Mode and User Mode and
                       enforce the segmentation of the memory areas in User Mode so that access of software
                       to memory areas is controlled. Any restrictions have to be defined by the Security IC
                       Embedded Software. Thereby security violations caused by accidental or deliberate
                       access to restricted data (which may include code) can be prevented (refer to
                       T.Unauthorised-Access). The threat T.Unauthorised-Access is therefore covered by the
                       objective.
                       The clarification of “Usage of Hardware Platform (OE.Plat-Appl)” makes clear that it is up
                       to the Security IC Embedded Software to implement the memory management scheme by
                       appropriately administrating the TSF. This is also expressed both in T.Unauthorised-
                       Access and O.FM_FW, O.MEM_ACCESS and O.SFR_ACCESS. The TOE shall provide
                       access control functions to be used by the Security IC Embedded Software. This is further
                       emphasised by the clarification of “Treatment of User Data (OE.Resp-Appl)” which reminds
                       that the Security IC Embedded Software must not undermine the restrictions of the
                       hardware platform. Therefore, the clarifications contribute to the coverage of the threat
                       T.Unauthorised-Access.
                       The justification related to the security objectives O.HW_DES3, O.HW_AES,
                       O.CUST_RECONFIG and O.EEPROM_INTEGRITY is as follows: Since these objectives
                       require the TOE to implement exactly the same specific security functionality as required
                       by P.Add-Components, the organisational security policy is covered by the objectives.
                       Nevertheless the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing, O.Malfunction,
                       O.Phys-Manipulation and O.Leak-Forced define how to implement the specific security
                       functionality required by P.Add-Components. These security objectives are also valid for
                       the additional specific security functionality since they must avert the related threats also
                       for the components added related to the policy.
                       The requirements for a multi-application platform necessitate the separation of users.
                       Therefore it is volitional that most of the security functionality can not be influenced or used
                       in User Mode.
                       The justification related to the assumption A.Key-Function is as follows:
                           • Compared to [6] a clarification has been made for the security objective “Usage of
                             Hardware Platform (OE.Plat-Appl)”: If required the Security IC Embedded Software
                             shall use the cryptographic service of the TOE and its interface as specified. In
                             addition, the Security IC Embedded Software (i) must implement operations on keys
                             (if any) in such a manner that they do not disclose information about confidential data
                             and (ii) must configure the memory management in a way that different applications

                                                                                                                      Security Target Lite



                             are sufficiently separated. If the Security IC Embedded Software uses random
                             numbers provided by the security service SS.RNG these random numbers must be
                             tested as appropriate for the intended purpose. This addition ensures that the
                             assumption A.Key-Function is still covered by the objective OE.Plat-Appl although
                             additional functions are being supported according to P.Add-Components.
                           • Compared to [6] a clarification has been made for the security objective “Treatment of
                             User Data (OE.Resp-Appl)”: By definition cipher or plain text data and cryptographic
                             keys are User Data. So, the Security IC Embedded Software will protect such data if
                             required and use keys and functions appropriately in order to ensure the strength of
                             cryptographic operation. Quality and confidentiality must be maintained for keys that
                             are imported and/or derived from other keys. This implies that appropriate key
                             management has to be implemented in the environment. In addition, the treatment of
                             User Data comprises the implementation of a multi-application operating system that
                             does not disclose security relevant User Data of one application to another one. These
                             measures make sure that the assumption A.Key-Function is still covered by the
                             security objective OE.Resp-Appl although additional functions are being supported
                             according to P.Add-Components.
                       The justification related to the assumption "Check of initialisation data by the Security IC
                       Embedded Software (A.Check-Init)" is as follows:
                       Since OE.Check-Init requires the Security IC Embedded Software developer to implement
                       a function assumed in A.Check-Init, the assumption is covered by the objective.
                       The justification of the additional policy and the additional assumptions show that they do
                       not contradict to the rationale already given in the PP [6] for the assumptions, policy and
                       threats defined there.

                       The extended component definition used for Random Number Generator has been taken

6. Security Requirements
                       This part of the Security Target defines the detailed security requirements that shall be
                       satisfied by the TOE. The statement of TOE security requirements shall define the
                       functional and assurance security requirements that the TOE needs to satisfy in order to
                       meet the security objectives for the TOE. This chapter consists of the sections “Security
                       Functional Requirements”, “Security Assurance Requirements” and “Security
                       Requirements Rationale”.
                       The CC allows several operations to be performed on security requirements (on the
                       component level); refinement, selection, assignment, and iteration are defined in
                       paragraph 8.1 of Part 1 of the CC [1]. These operations are used in the PP [6] and in this
                       Security Target, respectively.
                       The refinement operation is used to add details to requirements, and, thus, further
                       restricts a requirement. Refinements of security requirements are denoted in such a way
                       that added words are in bold text and changed words are crossed out.
                       The selection operation is used to select one or more options provided by the PP [6] or
                       CC in stating a requirement. Selections having been made are denoted as italic text.
                       The assignment operation is used to assign a specific value to an unspecified
                       parameter, such as the length of a password. Assignments having been made are
                       denoted by showing as italic text.
                       The iteration operation is used when a component is repeated with varying operations. It
                       is denoted by showing brackets “[iteration indicator]” and the iteration indicator within the
                       brackets.
                       For the sake of a better readability, the iteration operation may also be applied to some
                       single components (being not repeated) in order to indicate belonging of such SFRs to
                       same functional cluster. In such a case, the iteration operation is applied to only one
                       single component.
                       Whenever an element in the PP [6] contains an operation that the PP author left
                       uncompleted, the ST author has to complete that operation.

                 6.1 Security Functional Requirements
                       The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) of the TOE are presented in the following
                       sections to support a better understanding of the combination of PP “Security IC
                       Protection Profile” [6] and Security Target.
                  6.1.1 SFRs of the Protection Profile
                       Table 21 below shows all SFRs, which are specified in the PP [6] (in the order of definition
                       in the PP). Some of the SFRs are CC Part 2 extended and defined in the PP [6]. This is
                       shown in the third column of the table.

                       The operations for all SFR except for the SFR FAU_SAS.1 and FCS_RNG.1 are already
                       performed in the PP [6]. They are not changed compared to the Protection Profile. The

                       For the SFR FAU_SAS.1 the PP [6] leaves the assignment operation open for the

                       For FCS_RNG.1.1 the PP [6] partially fills in the assignment for the security capabilities of
                       the RNG by requiring a total failure test of the random source and adds an assignment
                       operation for additional security capabilities of the RNG.
                       In addition, for FCS_RNG.1.2 the PP [6] partially fills in the assignment operation for the
                       defined quality metric for the random numbers by replacing it by a selection and
                       assignment operation.
                       For the above operations the original operations defined in chapter 5 of the PP [6] have
                       been replaced by operations defined in chapter 3 of [8] and the open operations of the

                       FCS_RNG.1.1[HW]                           The TSF shall provide a physical 12 random number generator
                                                                 that implements:
                                         (PTG.2.1) A total failure test detects a total failure of entropy source
                                                   immediately when the RNG has started. When a total failure is
                                                   detected, no random numbers will be output.
                                         (PTG.2.2) If a total failure of the entropy source occurs while the RNG is
                                                   being operated, the RNG prevents the output of any internal
                                                   random number that depends on some raw random numbers

                                                   source13.
                                         (PTG.2.3) The online test shall detect non-tolerable statistical defects of
                                                   the raw random number sequence (i) immediately when the
                                                   RNG has started, and (ii) while the RNG is being operated. The
                                                   TSF must not output any random numbers before the power-up
                                                   online test has finished successfully or when a defect has been
                                                   detected.
                                         (PTG.2.4) The online test procedure shall be effective to detect non-
                                                   tolerable weaknesses of the random numbers soon.
                                         (PTG.2.5) The online test procedure checks the quality of the raw random
                                                   number sequence. It is triggered at regular intervals or
                                                   continuously14. The online test is suitable for detecting non-
                                                   tolerable statistical defects of the statistical properties of the raw

                       Note:                                     The TOE provides the two options where the Embedded

                       The Access Control Policy has some implications, that can be drawn from the policy and
                       that are essential parts of the TOE security functionality.
                            • Code executed in Boot Mode or Test Mode is quite powerful and used to configure
                              and test the TOE.
                            • Code executed in Firmware Mode is separated from code executed in System Mode
                              or User Mode. The separation is enforced by the partition of the memories provided
                              by the Memory Management Unit. Only small memory areas are used for data
                              exchange between the Firmware Operating System and the Security IC Embedded
                              Software. Furthermore, the exchange area in RAM is fully controlled by code running
                              in System Mode. The EEPROM data integrity function executed in Firmware Mode has
                              access to the whole EEPROM area to guarantee data integrity for EEPROM write
                              operations. Other Firmware functions have only access to a separated dedicated area
                              in the EEPROM. Separation is realized by means of a Firmware Firewall.
                            • Code executed in the System Mode can administrate the configuration of Memory
                              Management Unit, because it has access to the respective Special Function Registers.
                              Configuration means that the code can change the address of the MMU Segment
                              Table and also modify the contents of it (as long as the table is located in write-able
                              memory).
                            • Code executed in the User Mode cannot administrate the configuration of the Memory
                              Management Unit, because it has no access to the Special Function Registers to
                              configure the MMU segmentation. Therefore, changing the pointer to the MMU
                              Segment Table is not possible.
                            • It may be possible for User Mode code to modify the MMU Segment Table contents if
                              the table itself is residing in a memory location that is part of a Memory Segment that
                              the code has write access to.
                       The TOE shall meet the requirement “Static attribute initialisation (FMT_MSA.3)” as
                       specified below.

                 6.2 Security Assurance Requirements
                       Table 23 below lists all security assurance components that are valid for this Security
                       Target. With two exceptions these security assurance components are required by EAL6
                       (see Section 2.2) or by the PP “Security IC Platform Protection Profile” [6].
                       The exceptions are the components ASE_TSS.2 and ALC_FLR.1. ASE_TSS.2 is chosen
                       as an augmentation in this Security Target to give architectural information on the security
                       functionality of the TOE. ALC_FLR.1 is chosen as an augmentation in this Security Target
                       to cover policies and procedures of the developer applied to track and correct flaws and
                       support surveillance of the TOE.
                       Considering Application Note 21 of [6] the column “Required by” shows the differences in
                       the requirements of security assurance components between the PP [6] and the Security
                       Target. The entry “EAL6 / PP” denotes, that an SAR is required by both EAL6 and the
                       requirement of the PP [6], “EAL6” means that this requirement is due to EAL6 and beyond
                       the requirement of the PP [6], and “PP” identifies this component as a requirement of the
                       PP which is beyond EAL6. The augmentations ASE_TSS.2, ALC_FLR.1 chosen in this
                       Security Target are denoted by "ST". The refinements of the PP [6], which must be adapted

                  6.2.1 Refinements of the Security Assurance Requirements
                       The Security Target claims conformance to the PP [6] and therefore it has to conform to
                       the refinements of the TOE security assurance requirements (see Application Note 22 in
                       [6]). Because the refinements in the PP [6] are defined for the security assurance
                       components of EAL4, some refinements are necessary for assurance components of the
                       higher level EAL6 claimed in the Security Target.
                       Table 24 lists the refinements of the PP [6] for the Security Target. Most of the refined
                       security assurance components have the same level in both documents (PP [6] and
                       Security Target). The following five subsections apply the refinements to ALC_CMS.5,
                       ALC_CMC.5, ADV_FSP.5, ADV_IMP.2 and ATE_COV.3 which are different for the PP [6]
                       and the Security Target.

                           AGD_OPE               Same as in PP, refinement valid without change
                           AGD_PRE               Same as in PP, refinement valid without change
                           AVA_VAN               Same as in PP, refinement valid without change 58




                       58    According to Application Note 30 in the PP [6] the Security Target should indicate the version of the
                             document [5] used for the vulnerability analysis. The current version is given in the bibliography.

                          The further Security Assurance Requirements especially the further augmentations added
                          in this Security Target compared with the Protection Profile supplement and extent the
                          Security Assurance Requirements and can be added without contradictions.
                6.2.1.1     Refinements regarding CM scope (ALC_CMS)
                          This Security Target requires a higher evaluation level for the CC family ALC_CMS,
                          namely ALC_CMS.5 instead of ALC_CMS.4. The refinement of the PP [6] regarding
                          ALC_CMS.4 is a clarification of the configuration item “TOE implementation
                          representation”. Since in ALC_CMS.5, the content and presentation of evidence element
                          ALC_CMS.5.1C only adds an additional configuration item to the list of items to be tracked
                          by the CM system, the refinement can be applied without changes.
                          The refinement of the configuration item “TOE implementation representation” of
                          ALC_CMS.4 can be found in section the PP 6.2.1.3 of [6] and is not quoted here.
                6.2.1.2     Refinements regarding CM capabilities (ALC_CMC)
                          This Security Target requires a higher evaluation level for the CC family ALC_CMC,
                          namely ALC_CMC.5 instead of ALC_CMC.4. The refinement of the PP [6] regarding
                          ALC_CMC.4 is a clarification of the “TOE” and the term "configuration items". Since in
                          ALC_CMC.5 requires a higher assurance regarding the defined TOE and the configuration
                          items, the refinement can be applied without changes.
                          The refinements of the terms “TOE” and "configuration items" of ALC_CMC.4 can be
                          found in section the PP 6.2.1.4 of [6] and is not quoted here.
                6.2.1.3     Refinements regarding functional specification (ADV_FSP)
                          This Security Target requires a higher assurance level for the CC family ADV_FSP, namely
                          ADV_FSP.5 instead of ADV_FSP.4. The refinement of the PP [6] regarding ADV_FSP.4
                          addresses the complete representation of the TSF, the purpose and method of use of all
                          TSFI, and the accuracy and completeness of the SFR instantiations. The refinement is not
                          a change in the wording of the action elements, but a more detailed definition of the items
                          above is applied.
                          The higher level ADV_FSP.5 requires a Functional Specification in a “semi-formal style"
                          (ADV_FSP.5.2C).
                          The component ADV_FSP.5 extends the scope of the error messages to be described
                          from those resulting from an invocation of a TSFI (ADV_FSP.5.6C) to also those not
                          resulting from an invocation of a TSFI (ADV_FSP.5.7C). For the latter a rationale shall be
                          provided (ADV_FSP.5.8C).
                          Since the higher level ADV_FSP.5 only affects the style of description and the scope of
                          and rationale for error messages, the refinements can be applied without changes and are
                          valid for ADV_FSP.5.
                          The refinement of the original component ADV_FSP.4 can be found in Section 6.2.1.6 of
                          the Protection Profile [6] and is not quoted here.
                6.2.1.4     Refinements regarding Implementation Representation (ADV_IMP.2)
                          The refinement of the PP [6], section 6.2.1.7, regarding Implementation Representation
                          states that the provided implementation representation is complete and sufficient to ensure
                          that analysis activities are not curtailed due to lack of information. This Security Target

                          requires assurance level EAL6 augmented which requires access to complete source
                          code. Therefore the refinement of the PP [6] is implicitly fulfilled.
                6.2.1.5        Refinements regarding Test Coverage (ATE_COV.3)
                          Both refinements defined in the PP [6], section 6.2.1.8, regarding Test Coverage are
                          applied without change. The refinements defining test coverage under different operating

                          attacks. As this Security Target requires assurance level EAL6 augmented the latter
                          refinement can be applied without change and can be fulfilled by access to complete
                          source code and layout data. The refinement of test coverage under different operating
                          conditions is not a change in the wording of the action elements, but a more detailed

                          FDP_ACC.1[MEM], FDP_ACC.1[SFR], FDP_ACF.1[MEM], FDP_ACF.1[SFR] with the
                          associated dependencies. Further the secure state as required by FDP_FLS.1 is included
                          in the security policy model. In addition parts of the life cycle control as required by
                          FMT_LIM.2 are part of the model.

                 6.3 Security Requirements Rationale
                  6.3.1 Rationale for the security functional requirements
                          Section 6.3.1 in the PP [6] provides a rationale for the mapping between security functional
                          requirements and security objectives defined in the PP [6]. The mapping is reproduced in
                          the following table.

                       The justification related to the security objective “Triple DES Functionality”
                       (O.HW_DES3) is as follows:
                       O.HW_DES3 requires the TOE to support Triple DES encryption and decryption. Exactly
                       this is the requirement of FCS_COP.1[HW_DES]. Therefore FCS_COP.1[HW_DES] is
                       suitable to meet O.HW_DES3.
                       The justification related to the security objective “AES Functionality” (O.HW_AES) is as
                       follows:
                       O.HW_AES requires the TOE to support AES encryption and decryption. Exactly this is
                       the requirement of FCS_COP.1[HW_AES]. Therefore FCS_COP.1[HW_AES] is suitable
                       to meet O.HW_AES.
                       The justification related to security objective “Firmware Mode Firewall” (O.FM_FW) is as
                       follows:
                       The security functional requirement “Subset access control (FDP_ACC.1[MEM])” with the
                       related Security Function Policy (SFP) “Access Control Policy” exactly require to
                       implement a memory partition as demanded by O.FM_FW. Therefore, FDP_ACC.1[MEM]
                       with its SFP is suitable to meet the security objective.
                       The security functional requirement “Security attribute based access control
                       (FDP_ACF.1[MEM])” with the related Security Function Policy (SFP) “Access Control
                       Policy” defines the rules to implement the partition as demanded by O.FM_FW. Therefore,
                       FDP_ACF.1[MEM] with its SFP is suitable to meet the security objective.

                                                                                                                     Security Target Lite



                       The security functional requirement “Static attribute initialisation (FMT_MSA.3[MEM])”
                       requires that the TOE provide default values for the security attributes used by the Memory
                       Management Unit to enforce the memory partition. These default values are generated by
                       the reset procedure and the Boot-ROM Software for the related Special Function Register.
                       Restrictive with respect to memory partition means that the partition cannot be changed at
                       all and for the memory segmentation means that the initial setting is very restrictive since
                       it effectively disables any memory segment. They are needed by the TOE to provide a
                       default configuration after reset. Therefore this requirement (as dependency from
                       FDP_ACF.1) is suitable to meet the security objective.
                       The security functional requirement “Management of security attributes (FMT_MSA.1)”
                       requires that the ability to update the security attributes is restricted to privileged subject(s).
                       No management ability is specified in the two iterations of FMT_MSA.1 that can be used
                       to change the memory partition. Also no related management function is specified by
                       FMT_SMF.1[HW]. Therefore the memory partition is fixed and cannot be changed any
                       subject, which is the requirement of O.FM_FW.
                       The justification related to the security objective “Area based Memory Access Control
                       (O.MEM_ACCESS)” is as follows:
                       The security functional requirement “Subset access control (FDP_ACC.1[MEM])” with the
                       related Security Function Policy (SFP) “Access Control Policy” exactly require to
                       implement an area based memory access control as demanded by O.MEM_ACCESS.
                       Therefore, FDP_ACC.1[MEM] with its SFP is suitable to meet the security objective.
                       The security functional requirement “Security attribute based access control
                       (FDP_ACF.1[MEM])” with the related Security Function Policy (SFP) “Access Control
                       Policy” defines the rules to implement the area based memory access control as
                       demanded by O.MEM_ACCESS. Therefore, FDP_ACF.1[MEM] with its SFP is suitable to
                       meet the security objective.
                       The security functional requirement “Static attribute initialisation (FMT_MSA.3[MEM])”
                       requires that the TOE provide default values for the security attributes used by the Memory
                       Management Units. Since the TOE is a hardware platform these default values are
                       generated by the reset procedure for the related Special Function Register. They are
                       needed by the TOE to provide a default configuration after reset. Therefore, this
                       requirement (as dependency from FDP_ACF.1) is suitable to meet the security objective.
                       The security functional requirement “Management of security attributes (FMT_MSA.1)”
                       requires that the ability to update the security attributes is restricted to privileged subject(s).
                       These management functions ensure that the required access control can be realised
                       using the functions provided by the TOE. The iteration of FMT_MSA.1 into
                       FMT_MSA.1[MEM] and FMT_MSA.1[SFR] is needed because the different types of
                       objects have different security attributes. The security attributes of the Memory
                       Management Unit can be changed by the Security IC Embedded Software. Since the
                       pointer to the MMU Segment Table can only be changed in System Mode and this
                       protection is implemented by access control to the respective Special Function Registers,
                       both iterations are needed for O.MEM_ACCESS.
                       Finally, the security functional requirement “Specification of Management Functions
                       (FMT_SMF.1)” is used for the specification of the management functions to be provided
                       by the TOE as required by O.MEM_ACCESS. Therefore, FMT_SMF.1[HW] is suitable to
                       meet the security objective.

                                                                                                                    Security Target Lite



                       The justification related to the security objective “Special Function Register Access Control
                       (O.SFR_ACCESS)” is as follows:
                       The security functional requirement “Subset access control (FDP_ACC.1[SFR])” with the
                       related Security Function Policy (SFP) “Access Control Policy” require to implement
                       access control for Special Function Register as demanded by O.SFR_ACCESS.
                       Therefore, FDP_ACC.1[SFR] with its SFP is suitable to meet the security objective.
                       The access to Special Function Register is related to the CPU mode. The Special Function
                       Register used to configure the Memory Management Unit can only be accessed in System
                       Mode. The Special Function Register required to use hardware components like e.g. the
                       coprocessors or the Random Number Generator can be accessed in System Mode as
                       specified by the Security Function Policy (SFP) “Access Control Policy”. In User Mode only
                       Special Function Register required to run the CPU are accessible by default. In addition,
                       specific Special Function Registers related to hardware components can be made
                       accessible for the User Mode if the Memory Management Unit is configured to allow this.
                       The security functional requirement “Security attribute based access control
                       (FDP_ACF.1[SFR])” with the related Security Function Policy “Access Control Policy”
                       exactly require certain security attributes to implement the access control to Special
                       Function Register as required by O.SFR_ACCESS. Therefore, FDP_ACF.1[SFR] with its
                       SFP is suitable to meet the security objective.
                       The security functional requirement “Static attribute initialisation (FMT_MSA.3[SFR])”
                       requires that the TOE provides default values for the Special Function Register (values as
                       well as access control). The default values are needed to ensure a defined setup for the
                       operation of the TOE. Therefore, this requirement (as dependency from FDP_ACF.1) is
                       suitable to meet the security objective.
                       The security functional requirement “Management of security attributes
                       (FMT_MSA.1[SFR])” is realised in a way that – besides the definition of access rights to
                       Special Function Registers related to hardware components in User Mode and Firmware
                       Mode - no management of the security attributes is possible because the attributes are
                       implemented in the hardware and cannot be changed.
                       Finally, the security functional requirement “Specification of Management Functions
                       (FMT_SMF.1[HW])” is used for the specification of the management functions to be
                       provided by the TOE as demanded by O.SFR_ACCESS. Therefore, FMT_SMF.1[HW] is
                       suitable to meet the security objective.
                       Note that the iteration of FDP_ACF.1 and FDP_ACC.1 with the respective dependencies
                       are needed to separate the different types of objects because they have different security
                       attributes.
                       The justification related to the security objective “Integrity support of data stored in
                       EEPROM” (O.EEPROM_INTEGRITY) is as follows:
                       The security functional requirement “Stored data integrity monitoring and action
                       (FDP_SDI.2[HW])” is used for the specification of the control function to adjust the
                       conditions of an EEPROM block such that the integrity of the data read from EEPROM is
                       ensured even if the characteristics of the EEPROM changed e.g. due to ageing. Therefore,
                       FDP_SDI.2[HW] is suitable to meet the security objective.

                       The justification related to the security objective “Customer Option Reconfiguration”
                       (O.CUST_RECONFIG) is as follows:
                       The security functional requirement “Specification of Management Functions
                       (FMT_SMF.1[HW])” is used for the specification of the management functions to be
                       provided by the TOE as demanded by O.CUST_RECONFIG. Therefore, FMT_SMF.1[HW]
                       is suitable to meet the security objective.


                  6.3.2 Dependencies of security functional requirements
                       The dependencies listed in the PP [6] are independent of the additional dependencies
                       listed in the table below. The dependencies of the PP [6] are fulfilled within the PP [6] and
                       at least one dependency is considered to be satisfied.
                       The following discussion demonstrates how the dependencies defined by Part 2 of the
                       Common Criteria [2] for the requirements specified in Sections 6.1.2 and 6.1.3 are
                       satisfied.

                       The developer of the Security IC Embedded Software must ensure that the additional
                       security functional requirements FCS_COP.1[HW_DES] and FCS_COP.1[HW_AES] are
                       used as specified and that the User Data processed by the related security functionality is
                       protected as defined for the application context.
                       The dependent requirements of FCS_COP.1[HW_DES] and FCS_COP.1[HW_AES]
                       completely address the appropriate management of cryptographic keys used by the
                       specified cryptographic function and the management of access control rights as specified
                       for the memory access control function. All requirements concerning these management
                       functions shall be fulfilled by the environment (Security IC Embedded Software).
                       The functional requirements [FDP_ITC.1, or FDP_ITC.2 or FCS_CKM.1] and FCS_CKM.4
                       are not included in this Security Target since the TOE only provides a pure engine for
                       encryption and decryption without additional features for the handling of cryptographic
                       keys. Therefore, the Security IC Embedded Software must fulfill these requirements
                       related to the needs of the realised application.
                       The dependency FMT_SMR.1 introduced by the two components FMT_MSA.1 and
                       FMT_MSA.3 must be fulfilled by the Security IC Embedded Software. The definition and
                       maintenance of the roles that act on behalf of the functions provided by the hardware must
                       be subject of the Security IC Embedded Software.
                  6.3.3 Rationale for the Assurance Requirements
                       The selection of assurance components is based on the underlying PP [6]. The Security
                       Target uses the same augmentations as the PP, but chooses a higher assurance level.
                       The level EAL6 is chosen in order to meet assurance expectations of digital signature
                       applications and electronic payment systems. Additionally, the requirement of the PP [6]
                       to choose at least EAL4 is fulfilled.
                       The rationale for the augmentations is the same as in the PP. The assurance level EAL6
                       is an elaborated pre-defined level of the CC, part 3 [3]. The assurance components in an
                       EAL level are chosen in a way that they build a mutually supportive and complete set of
                       components. The requirements chosen for augmentation do not add any dependencies,
                       which are not already fulfilled for the corresponding requirements contained in EAL 6.
                       Therefore, these components add additional assurance to EAL 6, but the mutual support
                       of the requirements is still guaranteed.
                       As stated in the Section 6.3.3 of the PP [6], it has to be assumed that attackers with high
                       attack potential try to attack smartcards used for digital signature applications or payment
                       systems. Therefore, specifically AVA_VAN.5 was chosen by the PP [6] in order to assure
                       that even these attackers cannot successfully attack the TOE.
                  6.3.4 Security Requirements are internally Consistent
                       The discussion of security functional requirements and assurance components in the
                       preceding sections has shown that mutual support and consistency are given for both
                       groups of requirements. The arguments given for the fact that the assurance components
                       are adequate for the functionality of the TOE also show that the security functional and
                       assurance requirements support each other and that there are no inconsistencies between
                       these groups.

                       Function Register implemented according to the security functional requirement

                       defined in FDP_ACF.1[MEM] and FDP_ACF.1[SFR]. Therefore, these security functional
                       requirements support the secure implementation and operation of FCS_COP.1[HW_DES],
                       FCS_COP.1[HW_AES] and of FDP_ACC.1 with FDP_ACF.1 as well as the dependent
                       security functional requirements.
                       A hardware platform including the Security IC Dedicated Software requires Security IC
                       Embedded Software to build a secure product. Thereby the Security IC Embedded
                       Software must support the security functionality of the hardware as well as the Security IC
                       Dedicated Support Software and implement a sufficient management of the security
                       services implemented by the hardware platform including the Security IC Dedicated
                       Software. The realisation of the Security Functional Requirements within the TOE provides
                       a good balance between flexible configuration and restrictions to ensure a secure
                       behaviour of the TOE.

7. TOE Summary Specification
                       This chapter is composed of sections “Portions of the TOE Security Functionality” and
                       ”TOE Summary Specification Rationale”.

                 7.1 Portions of the TOE Security Functionality
                       The TOE Security Functionality (TSF) directly corresponds to the TOE security functional
                       requirements defined in Chapter 6. The Security Functionality provided by the TOE is split
                       into Security Services (SS) and Security Features (SF). Both are active and applicable to
                       phases 4 to 7 of the Security IC product life-cycle.
                       Note:         Parts of the security functionality are configured at the end of phase 3 and
                                     all security functionality is active after phase 3 or phase 4 depending on the
                                     delivery form.
                       The TOE also comprises security mechanisms, which are not listed as security
                       functionality in the following. Such mechanisms do not implement a complete Security
                       Services or Security Features. They can be used to implement further Security Services
                       and/or Security Features based on Security IC Embedded Software using these security
                       mechanisms, e.g. the Fame2 coprocessor for asymmetric cryptographic algorithms.
                  7.1.1 Security Services
                       SS.RNG: Random Number Generator
                       The Random Number Generator continuously produces random numbers with a length of
                       one byte. The TOE implements SS.RNG by means of a physical hardware Random
                       Number Generator working stable within the valid ranges of operating conditions, which
                       are guaranteed by SF.OPC.
                       The TSF provides a hardware test functionality, which can be used by the Security IC
                       Embedded Software to hardware detects or bad quality of the produced random numbers.
                       According to AIS31 [7] the Random Number Generator claims the functionality class
                       PTG2. This means that the Random Number Generator is suitable for generation of
                       signature key pairs, generation of session keys for symmetric encryption mechanisms,
                       random padding bits, zero-knowledge proofs, generation of seeds for DRNGs and fulfils
                       the online test requirements defined in [7].
                       SS.HW_DES: Triple-DES coprocessor
                       The TOE provides the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA) according to the Data
                       Encryption Standard (DES) [20]. SS.HW_DES is a modular basic cryptographic function,
                       which provides the TDEA algorithm as defined by FIPS PUB 46 by means of a hardware
                       coprocessor and supports (a) the 3-key Triple-DEA algorithm according to keying option 1
                       and (b) the 2-key Triple DEA algorithm according to keying option 2 in NIST SP800-67
                       [20]. The two/three 56-bit keys (112-/168-bit) for the 2-key/3-key Triple DES algorithm shall
                       be provided by the Security IC Embedded Software.
                       SS.HW_AES: AES coprocessor
                       The TOE provides the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm according to the
                       Advanced Encryption Standard as defined by FIPS PUB 197 [21]. SS.HW_AES is a
                       modular basic cryptographic function, which provides the AES algorithm by means of a

                       128, 192 or 256 bit. The keys for the AES algorithm shall be provided by the Security IC
                       Embedded Software.
                       SS.RECONFIG: Post Delivery Configuration
                       SS.RECONFIG realizes the Post Delivery Configuration. These can be used by the
                       customer to set the accessible size of the EEPROM and the accessible size of the CXRAM
                       and to enable or disable the Fame2 coprocessor, the AES coprocessor and the contactless
                       interface. The configuration values of the Post Delivery Configuration are stored in a
                       special area in the Security Row (see SF.COMP).
                       Note that if the Fame2 coprocessor and the AES coprocessor are disabled, both will no
                       longer be available to the Security IC Embedded Software and attempting to use it will
                       raise an exception. This means the availability of SS.HW_AES is configurable.
                       The customer can change the values of the Post Delivery Configuration through invoking
                       the Post Delivery Configuration functionality in the Boot-ROM Software (see
                       SF.MEM_ACC). This functionality is invoked by using the chip health mode via the ISO/IEC
                       7816 interface and applying the required Post Delivery Configuration commands.
                       The customer can change these values as many times as he wishes. However, once he
                       calls the Boot-ROM Software using the chip health mode via the ISO/IEC 7816 interface
                       with a certain parameter set to a specific value, the options are locked permanently, and
                       can no longer be changed. The options must be locked before the TOE is delivered to the
                       customer before phase 7 of the life cycle.
                  7.1.2 Security Features
                       SF.OPC: Control of Operating Conditions
                       SF.OPC ensures correct operation of the TOE (functions offered by the microcontroller
                       including the standard CPU as well as the Triple-DES coprocessor, AES coprocessor, the
                       Fame2 coprocessor, the memories, registers, I/O interfaces and the other system
                       peripherals) during execution of the Security IC Dedicated Support Software and Security
                       IC Embedded Software. This includes all security mechanisms of the TOE, which directly
                       contribute to a Security Service or a Security Feature.
                       The TOE ensures its correct operation and prevents any malfunction using the following
                       mechanisms: filtering of power supply, clock frequency and reset input as well as
                       monitoring of voltage supply, clock frequency input and the temperature of the chip by
                       means of sensors. There are multiple voltage and frequency sensors for the different
                       ISO/IEC 7816 voltage classes and the contactless operation mode. Light sensors are
                       distributed over the chip surface and used to detect light attacks. In addition to the light
                       sensors the EEPROM provides two functions to detect light attacks. The Security IC
                       Embedded Software can enable/disable the EEPROM double read function.
                       Specific functional units of the TOE are equipped with further fault injection detection. This
                       comprises the Secure Fetch for the processing of code and data by the CPU or special
                       circuitry within a functional unit. The functional units are the Program Counter, the stack
                       pointer, the CPU control register, the MMU address cache and control registers, the SBC
                       interface for the DES and the AES coprocessors, the Fame2 coprocessor, Copy Machine

                       the TOE contains a watchdog timer which can be enabled and configured by the Security
                       IC Embedded Software to protect the program execution.
                       If one of the monitored parameters is out of the specified range, either (i) a reset is forced
                       and the actually running program is aborted or (ii) an exception is raised which interrupts
                       the program flow and allows a reaction of the Security IC Embedded Software. In case
                       minor configuration option “Inverse EEPROM Error Correction” is enabled (see
                       Section 1.4.2.2) the probability to detect fault injection errors at the EEPROM memory and
                       interface increases and the error correction logic raises an exception when detecting an
                       error. The RAM memory is equipped with additional parity bits which are checked when
                       the corresponding data stored in RAM is read. Additionally, a RAM parity watchdog
                       mechanism is supported which checks the parity bits of the complete RAM in random order
                       when the Security IC Embedded Software is not accessing the RAM. In case of detected
                       RAM parity errors both mechanisms trigger a security reset. In case the TOE processes a
                       reset all components of the TOE are initialised with their reset values and the TOE provides
                       a reset cause indicator to the Security IC Embedded Software. In the case an exception is
                       raised an indicator for the reason of the exception is provided. The TOE defends the
                       sensors from being disabled by the Security IC Embedded Software.
                       The TOE controls the specified range of the stack pointer. The stack pointer and the related
                       control logic are implemented threefold for the User Mode, System Mode and Super
                       System Mode (comprising Boot Mode, Test Mode and Firmware Mode). An exception is
                       generated in case the specified limits are exceeded.
                       In addition, SF.OPC comprises a sensor, which checks the high voltage of the write
                       process to the EEPROM during each write sequence. The result of this sensor must be
                       read from a Special Function Register and does not force an automatic event (e.g.
                       exception).
                       SF.PHY: Protection against Physical Manipulation
                       SF.PHY protects the TOE against manipulation of (i) the IC hardware, (ii) the Security IC
                       Dedicated Software in ROM, (iii) the Security IC Embedded Software in ROM and
                       EEPROM, (iv) the Application Data in EEPROM and RAM including TSF data in the
                       Security Rows. It also protects User Data and TSF data against disclosure by physical
                       probing when stored or while being processed by the TOE.
                       The protection of the TOE comprises several security mechanisms in design and
                       construction, which make reverse-engineering and tamper attacks more difficult. These
                       mechanisms comprise dedicated shielding techniques for the TOE and specific encryption-
                       and check mechanisms for the memories and internal buses. SF.PHY supports the
                       efficiency of other portions of the security functionality.
                       SF.PHY also supports the integrity of the EEPROM, RAM and the ROM. The EEPROM is
                       able to correct a 1-bit error within each byte. The EEPROM corrects these errors
                       automatically without user interaction. The RAM and the ROM provide a parity check. In
                       both cases a reset is forced based on a parity error.
                       The CRC coprocessor is used in Boot Mode by the IC dedicated Software for calculation
                       of a CRC checksum for integrity protection of TSF data.

                       SF.LOG implements security mechanisms to limit or eliminate the information in the shape
                       and amplitude of signals or in the time between events, which might be found by measuring
                       such signals. This comprises the power supply, signals on other pads, which are not
                       intentionally used for communication by the terminal or the Security IC Embedded
                       Software as well as emanation of the hardware platform. Thereby SF.LOG prevents from
                       disclosure of User Data and TSF data stored and/or processed in the Security IC through
                       measurement of power consumption or emanation and subsequent complex signal
                       analysis. This protection of the TOE is enforced by several security mechanisms in the
                       design, which support these portions of security functionality.
                       The Triple-DES coprocessor includes specific security mechanisms to prevent SPA/DPA
                       analysis of shape and amplitude of the power consumption and emanation. The
                       implementation of the Triple-DES coprocessor further ensures that the calculation time is
                       independent from the chosen key value and plain/cipher text.
                       The AES coprocessor includes specific security mechanisms to prevent SPA/DPA analysis
                       of shape and amplitude of the power consumption and emanation. The implementation of
                       the AES coprocessor further ensures that the calculation time is independent from the
                       chosen key any plain/cipher text for a given key length.
                       The Fame2 coprocessor provides measures to prevent timing attacks on basic modular
                       function. The calculation time of an operation depends on the lengths of the operands, but
                       not on the value of the operands, with the following exceptions: multiplication with
                       reduction, modular inversion and modular division. These three operations have no
                       constant timing due to correction cycles that are needed based on the calculation method.
                       In addition, mechanisms are included, which provide limitations of the capability for the
                       analysis of shape and amplitude of the power consumption. Of course, the Fame2
                       coprocessor does not realise an algorithm on its own and algorithm-specific leakage
                       countermeasures have to be added by the Security IC Embedded Software when using
                       the Fame2 coprocessor.
                       Additional security mechanisms can be configured by the Security IC Embedded Software.
                       This comprises the configuration of the clock that can be used to prevent the
                       synchronisation between internal operations and external clock or characteristics of the
                       power consumption that can be used as trigger signal to support leakage attacks (DPA or
                       timing attacks)
                       Some mechanisms described for SF.PHY (e.g. the encryption mechanisms) and for
                       SF.OPC (e.g. the filter mechanisms) support SF.LOG.
                       SF.COMP: Protection of Mode Control
                       SF.COMP provides control of the CPU mode for (i) Boot Mode, (ii) Test Mode and (iii)
                       Firmware Mode. This includes protection of electronic fuses stored in a protected memory
                       area, the so-called Security Rows, and the possibility to store initialisation or pre-
                       personalisation data in the so-called FabKey Area.
                       Control of the CPU mode for Boot Mode, Test Mode and Firmware Mode prevents abuse
                       of test functions after TOE delivery. It also inhibits abuse of features, which are used during
                       start-up or reset to configure the TOE.
                       The integrity control of electronic fuses ensures secure storage and setup of configuration
                       and calibration data, during the start-up in Boot Mode. The protection of electronic fuses
                       especially ensures that configuration options with regard to the security functionality can

                       checksum generated using the CRC coprocessor. SF.COMP ensures that activation or
                       deactivation of security mechanisms can not be influenced by the Security IC Embedded
                       Software so that the TSF provides self-protection against interference and tampering by
                       untrusted Security IC Embedded Software.
                       SF.COMP protects CPU mode switches regarding Boot Mode, Test Mode and Firmware
                       Mode in the following way: Switching from Boot Mode to Test Mode or Firmware Mode is
                       allowed, switching from these modes back to Boot Mode is prevented. Switching to Test
                       Mode is prevented as well after TOE delivery, because Test Mode then is permanently
                       disabled. SF.COMP also ensures that Boot Mode is active only in the boot phase during
                       start-up or reset of the TOE, and can not be invoked afterwards. Therefore, once the TOE
                       has left the test phase and each time the TOE completed start-up or reset, Firmware Mode
                       is the only Super System Mode available.
                       The TSF controls access to the Security Rows, the top-most 512 Bytes of the EEPROM
                       memory, accessible at reserved addresses in the memory map. The available EEPROM
                       memory space for the Security IC Embedded Software is reduced by this area. SF.COMP
                       provides three memory areas in the Security Rows, which can be used by the Security IC
                       Embedded Software. These are
                           • the User Read Only Area
                           • the User Write Protected Area and
                           • the User Write Once Area.
                       The User Read Only Area contains 32 bytes, which are read-only for the Security IC
                       Embedded Software. The User Write Protected area contains 16 bytes, which can be write-
                       protected by the Security IC Embedded Software on demand. The User Write Once Area
                       contains 32 bytes of which each bit can separately be set to ‘1’ once only, and not reset to
                       ‘0’.
                       SF.COMP also provides a memory area in the Security Row where the current values for
                       the Post Delivery Configuration (see SS.RECONFIG). This area cannot be accessed by
                       the Security IC Embedded Software, but it can be accessed by the Resource Configuration
                       Firmware.
                       If minor configuration option “Card Disable Function" is used (refer to section 1.4.2.2)
                       SF.COMP inhibits any start-up of the Security IC Embedded Software once the Security
                       IC Embedded Software disables the card.
                       If minor configuration option “EEPROM application content erase” is used (see
                       Section 1.4.2.2) SF.COMP erases the application data stored in the EEPROM once the
                       Security IC Embedded Software has activated this security feature.
                       SF.COMP also provides the FabKey Area where initialisation and identification data can
                       be stored. The FabKey area does not belong to the Security Rows and is not protected by
                       hardware mechanisms. The FabKey Area as well as the Security Rows can be used by
                       SF.COMP to store a unique identification for each die.
                       The complete EEPROM is initialized during wafer testing and pre-personalisation. The
                       values for the Security Row depend on the configuration options and choice of the Security
                       IC Embedded Software developer. The values for the application EEPROM depend on the

                       choice of the Security IC Embedded Software developer and are included in the Order
                       Entry Form. The User Write Protected Area and the User Write Once Area are designed
                       to store the identification of a (fully personalised) Security IC (e.g. smartcard) or a
                       sequence of events over the life cycle, that can be coded by an increasing number of bits
                       set to "one" or protecting bytes, respectively.
                       SF.COMP limits the capabilities of the test functions and provides test personnel during
                       phase 3 with the capability to store identification and/or pre-personalisation data and/or
                       supplements of the Security IC Embedded Software in the EEPROM. SF.COMP provides
                       self-protection against interference and tampering by untrusted subjects both in the Test
                       Mode and in the other modes. It also enforces the separation of domains regarding the
                       Security IC Dedicated Software and the Security IC Embedded Software.
                       SF.MEM_ACC: Memory Access Control
                       SF.MEM_ACC controls access of any subject (program code comprising processor
                       instructions) to the memories of the TOE through the Memory Management Unit. Memory
                       access is based on virtual addresses that are mapped to physical addresses. The CPU
                       always uses virtual addresses. The Memory Management Unit performs the translation
                       from virtual to physical addresses and the physical addresses are passed from the Memory
                       Management Unit to the memory interfaces to access the memories. Access control is
                       conducted in two ways:
                           • Memory partitioning: Each memory type ROM, RAM and EEPROM is partitioned into
                             two parts. In Boot Mode and Firmware Mode the CPU has access to the
                             Firmware-EEPROM, Firmware-RAM and Test-ROM. In System Mode and User Mode
                             the CPU has access to the Application-EEPROM, Application-RAM and
                             Application-ROM. Access to both parts of each type is allowed in Test Mode for testing.
                           • The three accessible parts of the memory in ROM, RAM and EEPROM can be
                             segmented into smaller memory areas. Access rights including “---” (no access), “r--”
                             (read only), and “r-x” (read and execute) can be defined for the ROM segments.
                             Access rights including “---” (no access), “rw-” (read and write) and “rwx” (no restriction)
                             can be defined for the EEPROM segments. Access rights including “---” (no access),
                             “rw-” (read and write) and “rwx” (no restriction) can be defined for the RAM segments.
                             In addition, access rights to Special Function Registers related to hardware
                             components can be defined for code executed in User Mode.
                       Memory partitioning is fixed and can not be changed. It is determined during production of
                       the TOE and is solely dependent on the major configuration and the minor configuration
                       option OS Emulation (see Section 1.4.2.2) and Post Delivery Configuration (see
                       Section 1.4.2.3).
                       Memory segmentation can be defined in System Mode. The segmentation is active when
                       the CPU switches to User Mode. The segments, their access rights and the access rights
                       to Special Function Registers related to hardware components are defined in the MMU
                       Segment Table. The MMU Segment Table stores five values for each segment: The
                       memory access rights, the virtual start address of the segment, the virtual end address of
                       the segment, the address offset for the segment and the access rights to Special Function
                       Registers for code that is executed in the segment. The address offset is used to relocate
                       the segment anywhere in the memory map. The resulting address computed by the
                       Memory Management Unit can not overrule memory partitioning. Up to 64 segments can
                       be defined in the MMU Segment Table. Special configurations of the memory access rights

                       allow to specify less than 64 segments and to split the MMU Segment Table into several
                       parts being stored at different locations in memory.
                       Note that the MMU Segment Table itself is stored in the memory and therefore the table
                       itself can be placed in a segment accessible in User Mode.
                       In addition, SF.MEM_ACC permanently checks whether accessed addresses point to
                       physically implemented memory. Any access outside the boundaries of the physical
                       implemented memory in all CPU modes except the Test Mode and access to forbidden
                       memory addresses in User Mode are notified by raising an exception.
                       The Memory Management Unit also handles access rights to Special Function Registers
                       related to hardware components for code running in Firmware Mode. The configuration of
                       the access rights for User Mode and Firmware Mode are used by SF.SFR_ACC to grant
                       or block access to the related Special Function Registers. The access rights can be defined
                       for up to 16 groups of Special Function Registers, which are related to 16 hardware
                       peripherals or memories described in [9], section 12.4. Thus, User Mode and Firmware
                       Mode can be restricted in their access to the Special Function Registers related to
                       hardware components on demand of the Security IC Embedded Software. Note that
                       SF.MEM_ACC only provides the access rights to SF.SFR_ACC, the access control is
                       enforced by SF.SFR_ACC.
                       SF.SFR_ACC: Special Function Register Access Control
                       SF.SFR_ACC controls access to the Special Function Registers and CPU mode switches
                       based on specific Special Function Register.
                       SF.SFR_ACC implements access control to the Special Function Registers as specified in
                       the Access Control Policy and the Security Functional Requirements FDP_ACC.1[SFR]
                       and FDP_ACF.1[SFR].
                       The function of the Special Function Register and the CPU mode determine, whether read
                       and/or write access to a Special Function Register is allowed or not. Key registers cannot
                       be read since they are write-only to support the confidentiality of keys. Write access is
                       granted depending on the CPU mode. Similar for the output register of the Random
                       Number Generator, which is read-only based on its function, and read access is granted
                       based on the CPU mode.
                       SF.SFR_ACC controls accesses to Special Function Registers. If the access is not allowed
                       or the Special Function Register addressed by the code is not implemented an exception
                       is triggered. The Security IC Embedded Software can react on this exception.
                       Some Special Function Registers are implemented threefold, one for User Mode, a second
                       one for System Mode and a third one for Super System Mode meaning Boot Mode, Test
                       Mode and Firmware Mode. Hence, such Special Function Registers are inherently
                       separated and enforce the separation between the CPU modes.
                       SF.SFR_ACC relies on access rights to Special Function Registers related to hardware
                       components, which are provided by SF.MEM_ACC. Access rights to all other Special
                       Function Registers are pre-defined and can not be configured by the code running on the
                       hardware platform.
                       This implies that code running in User Mode or Firmware Mode is not able to use SS.RNG,
                       SS.HW_DES, and SS.HW_AES until access to the respective group of Special Function
                       Registers is explicitly granted by code running in System Mode. This holds for all 16

                       Registers related to hardware components.
                       SF.SFR_ACC also implements transitions among CPU modes based on specific Special
                       Function Register.
                       The CPU mode changes by the following operations.
                           • Call of a system call vector (SVEC) address or a firmware vector (FVEC) address. A
                             call of a SVEC enables System Mode, a call of a FVEC sets enables Firmware Mode.
                             Calls of SVEC addresses are allowed in User Mode only, otherwise an exception is
                             raised.
                           • Execution of an exception or interrupt. Any event that leads to the execution of an
                             exception leads to a special status of the related CPU mode. Any further exception in
                             this special status forces a reset. Interrupts can be executed in User Mode or in System
                             Mode as well as in Firmware Mode. The Security IC Embedded Software running in
                             System Mode can configure this option at run time.
                           • Return from an exception/interrupt or vector call with a RETI instruction. This restores
                             the CPU mode before the event occurred. A RETI in User Mode is allowed only in case
                             interrupts are allowed to be executed in User Mode and an interrupt is actually active,
                             otherwise an exception is raised.
                           • Execution of an LCALL/ACALL/ECALL instruction to a specific address. A call of
                             address 0x800000 in System Mode enables User Mode and starts execution at this
                             (virtual) address. This is similar to a FVEC or SVEC call, but no return address is
                             pushed onto the stack.
                           • Direct modification of the specific Special Function Register. Hardware provided by
                             SF.SFR_ACC ensures that the bits can only be cleared. Therefore, it is not possible
                             for code running in User Mode to enter System Mode, but System Mode can switch to
                             User Mode.
                       Two CPU modes are available to the Security IC Embedded Software, which are System
                       Mode and User Mode. System Mode is the more privileged CPU mode since it allows
                       access to all Special Function Registers related to hardware components and for system
                       management (i.e. configuration of Memory Management Unit, clock settings and some
                       mechanisms provided by SF.LOG). User Mode is the less privileged, but in regard to
                       hardware components it can be made as powerful as System Mode.
                       SF.SFR_ACC and SF.COMP together ensure that other CPU modes are not available to
                       the Security IC Embedded Software, but reserved for specific purposes fulfilled by the
                       Security IC Dedicated Software. As described above, SF.MEM_ACC provides the access
                       control information to Special Function Registers related to hardware components in
                       Firmware Mode and User Mode.
                       SF.FFW: Firmware Firewall
                       SF.FFW (Protected Firmware Mode) implements a mechanism to protect the application

                       SF.FIRMWARE (Firmware Operating System) implements specific basic support
                       functionality for the Security IC Embedded Software. The basic support functionality is
                       implemented in a way that the protection and separation of the different type of User Data
                       is enforced. The security feature SF.FIRMWARE is based on the security features
                       SF.MEM_ACC, SF.SFR_ACC and SF.FFW.
                       The provided functionality comprises the integrity protection of the data stored in the
                       EEPROM and resource reconfiguration support. Additionally the baud rate configuration
                       for the contactless operation is supported.

                       "X" in the table above means that the specific portion of the TOE security functionality
                       realises the functionality required by the respective Security Functional Requirement. “O”
                       in the table above means that the specific portion of the TOE security functionality supports
                       the functionality required by the respective Security Functional Requirement.
                       As already stated in the definition of the portions of the TOE security functionality there are
                       additional security mechanisms, which can contribute to security functionality when they
                       are appropriately controlled by the Security IC Embedded Software. E.g. the Fame2
                       coprocessor can be used to implement leakage-resistant asymmetric cryptographic
                       algorithms.
                       As part of the Security IC Dedicated Software the NXP firmware functionality is separated
                       from the Security IC Embedded Software by memory partitioning according to
                       SF.MEM_ACC, SF.FFW and by CPU mode control according to SF.SFR_ACC and
                       SF.COMP. The data exchange areas are also controlled by SF.MEM_ACC and SF.FFW
                       and must be configured by the Security IC Embedded Software. This ensures that the OS
                       Emulation functionality does not violate the TSF.

                  7.2.3 Security architectural information
                       Since this Security Target claims the assurance requirement ASE_TSS.2 security
                       architectural information on a very high level is supposed to be included in the TSS to
                       inform potential customers on how the TOE protects itself against interference, logical
                       tampering and bypass. In the security architecture context, this covers the aspects self-
