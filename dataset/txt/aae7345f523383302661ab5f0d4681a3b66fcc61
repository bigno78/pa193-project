A.      Certification

1.      Preliminary Remarks
Under the BSIG1 Act, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) has the task of
issuing certificates for information technology products.
Certification of a product is carried out on the instigation of the vendor or a distributor,
hereinafter called the sponsor.
A part of the procedure is the technical examination (evaluation) of the product according
to the security criteria published by the BSI or generally recognised security criteria.
The evaluation is normally carried out by an evaluation facility recognised by the BSI or by
BSI itself.
The result of the certification procedure is the present Certification Report. This report
contains among others the certificate (summarised assessment) and the detailed
Certification Results.
The Certification Results contain the technical description of the security functionality of
the certified product, the details of the evaluation (strength and weaknesses) and
instructions for the user.

2.      Specifications of the Certification Procedure
The certification body conducts the procedure according to the criteria laid down in the
following:
●   Act on the Federal Office for Information Security 1
●   BSI Certification and Approval Ordinance2
●   BSI Schedule of Costs 3
●   Special decrees issued by the Bundesministerium des Innern (Federal Ministry of the
    Interior)
●   DIN EN ISO/IEC 17065 standard
●   BSI certification: Scheme documentation describing the certification process (CC-
    Produkte) [3]
●   BSI certification: Scheme documentation on requirements for the Evaluation Facility, its
    approval and licencing process (CC-Stellen) [3]
●   Common Criteria for IT Security Evaluation (CC), Version 3.1 4 [1] also published as

3.      Recognition Agreements
In order to avoid multiple certification of the same product in different countries a mutual
recognition of IT security certificates - as far as such certificates are based on ITSEC or
CC - under certain conditions was agreed.

3.1.    European Recognition of CC – Certificates (SOGIS-MRA)
The SOGIS-Mutual Recognition Agreement (SOGIS-MRA) Version 3 became effective in
April 2010. It defines the recognition of certificates for IT-Products at a basic recognition
level and, in addition, at higher recognition levels for IT-Products related to certain SOGIS
Technical Domains only.
The basic recognition level includes Common Criteria (CC) Evaluation Assurance Levels
EAL 1 to EAL 4. For "Smartcards and similar devices" a SOGIS Technical Domain is in
place. For "HW Devices with Security Boxes" a SOGIS Technical Domains is in place, too.
In addition, certificates issued for Protection Profiles based on Common Criteria are part of
the recognition agreement.
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes, details on
recognition, and the history of the agreement can be seen on the website at
https://www.sogis.eu.
The SOGIS-MRA logo printed on the certificate indicates that it is recognised under the
terms of this agreement by the related bodies of the signatory nations. A disclaimer
beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of recognition.
This certificate is recognized under SOGIS-MRA for all assurance components selected.

3.2.    International Recognition of CC – Certificates (CCRA)
The international arrangement on the mutual recognition of certificates based on the CC
(Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement, CCRA-2014) has been ratified on 08
September 2014. It covers CC certificates based on collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP)
(exact use), CC certificates based on assurance components up to and including EAL 2 or
the assurance family Flaw Remediation (ALC_FLR) and CC certificates for Protection
Profiles and for collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP).
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes can be seen on
the website: https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org.
The Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement logo printed on the certificate indicates
that this certification is recognised under the terms of this agreement by the related bodies
of the signatory nations. A disclaimer beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of
recognition.
This certificate is recognized according to the rules of CCRA-2014, i. e. up to and including
CC part 3 EAL 2+ ALC_FLR components.

4.      Performance of Evaluation and Certification
The certification body monitors each individual evaluation to ensure a uniform procedure, a
uniform interpretation of the criteria and uniform ratings.
The product Infineon Security Controller M7893 B11 with optional RSA2048/4096
v2.03.008, EC v2.03.008, SHA-2 v1.01, SCL v2.02.010 libraries and Toolbox v2.03.008
and with specific IC dedicated software (firmware), has undergone the certification
procedure at BSI. This is a re-certification based on BSI-DSZ-CC-0879-V3-2018. Specific
results from the evaluation process BSI-DSZ-CC-0879-V3-2018 were re-used.
The evaluation of the product Infineon Security Controller M7893 B11 with optional
RSA2048/4096 v2.03.008, EC v2.03.008, SHA-2 v1.01, SCL v2.02.010 libraries and
Toolbox v2.03.008 and with specific IC dedicated software (firmware), was conducted by
TÜV Informationstechnik GmbH. The evaluation was completed on 11 February 2020.
TÜV Informationstechnik GmbH is an evaluation facility (ITSEF) 5 recognised by the
certification body of BSI.
For this certification procedure the sponsor and applicant is: Infineon Technologies AG.
The product was developed by: Infineon Technologies AG.
The certification is concluded with the comparability check and the production of this
Certification Report. This work was completed by the BSI.

5.      Validity of the Certification Result
This Certification Report applies only to the version of the product as indicated. The
confirmed assurance package is valid on the condition that
●   all stipulations regarding generation, configuration and operation, as given in the
    following report, are observed,
●   the product is operated in the environment described, as specified in the following report
    and in the Security Target.
For the meaning of the assurance components and assurance levels please refer to CC
itself. Detailed references are listed in part C of this report.
The Certificate issued confirms the assurance of the product claimed in the Security Target
at the date of certification. As attack methods evolve over time, the resistance of the
certified version of the product against new attack methods needs to be re-assessed.
Therefore, the sponsor should apply for the certified product being monitored within the
assurance continuity program of the BSI Certification Scheme (e.g. by a re-assessment or
re-certification). Specifically, if results of the certification are used in subsequent evaluation
and certification procedures, in a system integration process or if a user's risk
management needs regularly updated results, it is recommended to perform a re-
assessment on a regular e.g. annual basis.
In order to avoid an indefinite usage of the certificate when evolved attack methods would
require a re-assessment of the products resistance to state of the art attack methods, the
maximum validity of the certificate has been limited. The certificate issued on 12 February
2020 is valid until 11 February 2025. Validity can be re-newed by re-certification.
The owner of the certificate is obliged:

     3. to inform the Certification Body at BSI immediately in the case that security relevant
        changes in the evaluated life cycle, e.g. related to development and production sites
        or processes, occur, or the confidentiality of documentation and information related
        to the Target of Evaluation (TOE) or resulting from the evaluation and certification
        procedure where the certification of the product has assumed this confidentiality
        being maintained, is not given any longer. In particular, prior to the dissemination of
        confidential documentation and information related to the TOE or resulting from the
        evaluation and certification procedure that do not belong to the deliverables
        according to the Certification Report part B, or for those where no dissemination
        rules have been agreed on, to third parties, the Certification Body at BSI has to be
        informed.
In case of changes to the certified version of the product, the validity can be extended to
the new versions and releases, provided the sponsor applies for assurance continuity (i.e.
re-certification or maintenance) of the modified product, in accordance with the procedural
requirements, and the evaluation does not reveal any security deficiencies.

1.     Executive Summary
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is an Infineon Security Controller M7893 B11 with optional
Software Library RSA2048/4096 v2.03.008, EC v2.03.008, SHA-2 v1.01, SCL v2.02.010
libraries, and Toolbox v2.03.008, as well as with specific IC dedicated software (firmware).
The TOE provides a real 16-bit CPU-architecture and is compatible to the 80251
microcontroller architecture. The major components of the core system are the two CPUs
(Central Processing Units), acting as one, the MMU (Memory Management Unit) and MED
(Memory Encryption/Decryption Unit). The dual interface controller is able to communicate
using either the contact based or the contactless interface.
The TOE consists of the hardware part, the firmware parts and the software parts.
The software parts are differentiated into the cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, and SHA-2,
symmetric cryptographic libraries and the supporting libraries Toolbox and Base. The Base
Library does not provide any specific security functionality on its own. However it is a
necessary perquisite in order to use the RSA, EC and Toolbox libraries.
This TOE is intended to be used in smart cards and other form factors for particularly
security-relevant applications and for its prevalent use as developing platform for smart
card operating systems. The term Smartcard Embedded Software is used in the following
for all operating systems and applications stored and executed on the TOE. The TOE is
the platform for the Smartcard Embedded Software.
The Security Target [6] is the basis for this certification. It is based on the certified
Protection Profile Security IC Platform Protection Profile, Version 1.0, 15 June 2007, BSI-
CC-PP-0035-2007 [8]. The TOE Security Functional Requirements are implemented by
the following TOE Security Functionality:
  TOE Security Functionality         Addressed issue
  SF_DPM                             Device Phase Management:
                                     The life cycle of the TOE is split up into several
                                     phases. Different operation modes help to protect
                                     the TOE during each phase of its lifecycle.
  SF_PS                              Protection against Snooping:
                                     The TOE uses various means to protect from
                                     snooping of memories and busses and prevents
                                     single stepping.
  SF_PMA                             Protection against Modifying Attacks:
                                     This TOE implements protection against
                                     modifying attacks of memories, alarm lines and
                                     sensors.
  SF_PLA                             Protection against Logical Attacks:
                                     The memory access control of the TOE uses a
                                     memory management unit (MMU) to control the
                                     access to the available physical memory by using
                                     virtual memory addresses and to segregate the
                                     code and data to a privilege level model. The
                                     MMU controls the address permissions of up
                                     seven privileged levels and gives the software the
                                     possibility to define different access rights. The
                                     address permissions of the privilege levels are




                                                                                                11 / 33

                                       controlled by the MMU. In case of an access
                                       violation the MMU will trigger a reset and then a
                                       trap service routine can react on the access
                                       violation.
  SF_CS                                Cryptographic Support:
                                       The TOE is equipped with several hardware
                                       accelerators and software modules to support the
                                       standard      symmetric     and       asymmetric
                                       cryptographic operations. The components are a
                                       coprocessor supporting the DES and AES
                                       algorithms and a combination of a coprocessor
                                       and software modules to support RSA
                                       cryptography, RSA key generation, ECDSA
                                       signature generation and verification, ECDH key
                                       agreement and EC public key calculation and
                                       public key testing. Furthermore, the TOE is
                                       equipped with an optional SHA-2 library and
                                       HASH module as well as well as an AIS31
                                       conformant TRNG that meets the functionality

                                     Table 2: Deliverables of the TOE

The delivery documentation describes all procedures that are necessary to maintain
security when distributing versions of the TOE or parts of it to the user’s site including the
necessary intermediate delivery procedures.
Furthermore, the delivery documentation describes in a sufficient manner how the various
procedures and technical measures provide for the detection of modifications and any
discrepancies between the TOE respective parts of it send by the TOE Manufacturer and
the version received by the Composite Product Manufacturer.
Three different delivery procedures have to be taken into consideration:
    ●   Delivery of the IC dedicated software components (IC dedicated SW, guidance)
        from the TOE Manufacturer to the IC Embedded Software Developer.
    ●   Delivery of the IC Embedded Software (ROM / Flash data, initialisation and pre-
        personalisation data) from the IC Embedded Software Developer to the TOE
        Manufacturer.
    ●   Delivery of the final TOE from the TOE Manufacturer to the Composite Product
        Manufacturer. After phase 3 the TOE is delivered in form of wafers or sawn wafers,
        after phase 4 in form of modules (with or without inlay antenna).
Respective distribution centers are listed in Appendix B (see below).
The individuaific
configured, not flashed and not personalized TOE products to the user warehouse.
Extra authentication means applied in the PIN-Letter status of the Flash Loader preserve that only the intended
user with the intended PIN-Letter can configure with user specific information and enable the normal Flash
Loader functions in a second step. By that the user orders the products and receives - in a protected way - the
belonging PIN-Letter. PIN-Letter and delivered chips must match.
By delivery the user warehouse gets filled and depending on market demands the user can immediate apply the
authentication means of the PIN-letter. If passing, the TOE products become user specific configured and the
Flash Loader can be used for this specific user in a second step.
The following table outlines the different ways how the user can input his software on this TOE – a TOE without
user available ROM. User software comprises usually the operating system and applications, which are for
Infineon Technologies simply a user data package which is handled as a fixed data package during production.
This provides high process flexibility for the user of which an overview is given in the following table:

For the cases with active Flash Loader on board and whenever the user has finalized his SW-download,
respectively the TOE is in the final state and about to be delivered to the end-user, the user is obligated to lock
the Flash Loader. This locking is the final step and results in a permanent deactivation of the Flash Loader. This
means that once being in the locked status, the Flash Loader cannot be reactivated anymore.
Note that whenever a TOE comes without active Flash Loader, BPU and PIN-Letter process are not possible.
All in all various delivery combinations are given and for example, a product can come with a fix configuration
and with Flash Loader, to enable the user to download software, but without BPU option and with PIN-Letter.
The following cases can occur:

The listing provided in the confidential security target [8] contains the memory size ranges and other blocking
options, focusing on the maximum respectively minimum user available limitations. Within those limitations the
TOE configurations can vary under only one identical IC-hardware, regardless whether the configurations are set
by Infineon or within further limitations by the user. All configurations throughout all different mask sets the
TOE is made off and all thereof resulting derivatives have no impact on security and are covered by the
certificate.

Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)


Note that this TOE has no user available ROM. The user software and data are entirely located in a dedicated and
protected part of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The long life storage endurance together with the means for error
detection and correction serves for excellent reliability and endurance.
In addition to the above listed flexible ranges, the user guidance contains a number of predefined configurations
for those customers not making use of the BPU option. All of these configurations belong to the TOE as well and
are of course made of the equal hardware and are inside the above declared ranges.
Today’s predefined configurations of the TOE are listed in the hardware reference manual HRM [1] and is
completed with the list of identification data of the derivatives. These predefined products come with the most
requested configurations and enables to produce volumes on stock in order to simplify logistic processes.
According to the BPU option, a non-limited number of configurations of the TOE may occur in the field. The
number of various configurations depends on the user and order contract only.
This TOE provides dedicated identification means and outputs the platform identifier, the design step and
further configuration information. The hardware reference manual HRM [1] is part of the user guidance and
enables for the clear interpretation of the read out identification data. More information is given in the
confidential Security Target [8].
These output data enable the user for clear identification of the TOE and also of one of the different mask sets
and therewith for examination of the validity of the certificate.
In addition, a dedicated RMS function allows reading out the present configuration in detail. The output RMS
data together with the hardware reference manual HRM [1] enables for clear identification of a product and its
configuration. All these steps for gathering identification and detailed configuration information can be done by
the user without involving the vendor, Infineon Technologies AG.

The TOE consists of the hardware part, the firmware parts in the alternative versions and the optional software
parts. The Smartcard Embedded Software, i.e. the operating system and applications are not part of the TOE.

The firmware comes with several alternative versions and consists of:
    the Boot Software (BOS) firmware conducting configuration and testing task (see chapter 2.2.2) at start-
        up of the TOE
    the Resource Management System (RMS) library providing essential basis functions for the management
        of the RAM, the branch table, the Memory Management Unit (MMU) and other resources
    the optional Flash Loader enabling for the download of user software to the SOLID FLASH™ NVM and
        required for the optional Bill per Use (BPU) feature and the PIN-letter feature
    the Radio Frequency Application Interface (RFAPI) supporting functions located in the ROM.
        The RFAPI functions are not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF)
    the NRG ROM part implementing some basic routines and used by the NRG if ordered.
        The NRG ROM part is not part of the TSF functionality.

The firmware parts BOS, RFAPI and NRG are implemented in a separated Test-ROM also being part of the TOE
but not available for the user. Completing firmware components are located in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM.

The optional software parts are differentiated into following libraries:
    The asymmetric cryptographic libraries (ACL) in following alternative versions:
       v2.08.007, v2.07.003 and v2.06.003.
           o All ACL libraries provide RSA1 2048/4096 cryptography.
                The library supports also smaller key lengths, but the certification follows the national regulation
                by the BSI1.

        the NRG Software. The NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

The RSA, EC and Toolbox libraries provide certain functionality via an API to the Smartcard Embedded Software.
The private parts of the cryptographic libraries are only used internally and have no user interface. If neither the
RSA- nor the EC library is delivered, also the belonging private parts are not on board. The Toolbox library does
not have private library parts.
Each of the libraries ACL, SCL, HSL and NRG is independent from the other libraries and also independent of the
alternative library version of the equal type. This means for example that the HSL-1 runs alone and does not need
parts of HSL-2.
A combination respectively mix up of the two alternative libraries of equal type has not been considered in the
design and is not allowed: The user can select either one or the other of the same library type or none of it.
If the user considers the optional software libraries, the TOE can be delivered including – in free combinations –
or not including any of the optional libraries.

If the user decides not to use any of the offered asymmetric cryptographic libraries, regardless of the version
chosen, none of the cryptographic libraries is consequently delivered and the accompanying Additional Specific
Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions) Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and/ or EC is/are not provided by the
TOE. Else it depends of the chosen library whether the Additional Specific Security Functionality
(O.Add-Functions) Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and/ or EC is/are supported.

The Toolbox library, regardless of the version chosen, provides the user optionally basic arithmetic and modular
arithmetic operations, in order to support user software development using long integer operations. These basic
arithmetic operations do not provide security functionality, implement no security mechanism, and do not
proved additional specific security functionality – as defined for the cryptographic libraries.
The user developed software using the Toolbox basic operations is not part of the TOE.
The Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

The symmetric cryptographic library SCL – in both versions – offers a high level interface to perform the
cryptographic operations DES, TDES and AES with different key lengths on the symmetric cryptographic
coprocessor (SCP) for this TOE. In addition, the SCL in version v2.04.002 implements computation of a CMAC
using AES and 3DES algorithms.

 BSI – Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik – Federal Office for Information Security: Following the national BSI
    recommendations, RSA key lengths below 1976 bits are not included in the certificate. Please note that the BSI expects this key length

Public Security Target
Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)


The SCL implements already several block cipher modes as declared in this document and covering a wide range
of applications, the SCL offers in addition the flexibility to implement additional block cipher modes defined by
the user.
This library provides a simplified interface to the hardware Symmetric Cryptographic Coprocessor (SCP) and
preserves the security and performance requirements as required by the user.
Note that the definition of the key lengths follows the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100 bit security
level by the BSI. This excludes the single DES operation from the certification.

Beside the inclusion and support of cryptographic libraries this TOE comes with the optional Hardware Support
Library (HSL) in different versions significantly simplifying the management of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM
functionality. The HSL constitutes an application interface (API) accessing the HSL state machine and
abstracting low level properties like special function registers and settings of specific hardware features. In short
the HSL provides a user friendly also use case oriented interface considering endurance, reliability and
performance requirements.
In certain configurations each of the HSL versions provide also functions implementing tearing safe behaviour of
the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. If applied the user has no need to care about cases where the TOE is unintentionally
removed from the power supply or the radio frequency field even during managing the SOLID FLASH™ NVM.
Anyhow, the HSL – regardless of the version – remains as an optional library, as even sudden power off situations
do not lead to exploitable conditions of the TOE. In the worse, the TOE ends operation in case of a faulty
programmed SOLID FLASH™ NVM location.
In addition to the above, the HSL in version 03.12.8812 and 03.11.8339 provide an advanced additional method
called Incremental Write (IWR). This method provides enhanced endurance of the SOLID FLASH NVM even
beyond the erase endurance limits for often written objects. Thus this method serves applications with a demand
for high endurance and fast writing times. On the other hand, the read times using this method are slower than
the other methods provided.

The order option CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CIPURSE™ CL) provides cryptographic functionality to
implement a CIPURSE™ V2 conformant protocol.
This protocol provides a secure mutual authentication of two entities, namely the terminal (denoted as PCD =
Proximity Coupling Device (CIPURSE™-compliant terminal)) and a smart card or a token in other form factors
which is called PICC. PICC stands for Proximity Integrated Circuit Card (CIPURSE™-compliant card).
Beside the mutual authentication, the protocol implements measures to maintain the integrity of the transferred
data and preserves in parallel the confidentiality of the transferred data.
By that the CIPURSE™ CL supports the user to implement systems conformant to the CIPURSE™ open standard
implementing a secured, interoperable and flexible transit fare collection solution, including ISO 7816, ISO/IEC
14443-4 communication and AES-128 bit cryptography for multiple payment types.

The NRG Software is a further order option and implements the routines for a NRG interface. The NRG provides
an operating system handling the emulation of a NRG card together with the RF interface. One part of the NRG
is permanently stored in the ROM and the second part consisting of patch and API is located in the SOLID
FLASH™ NVM. The second part is only present if the NRG is part of the delivery. If the NRG is not part of the
delivery the ROM part is present but not used. The NRG implements tearing safe behaviour in context with the
SOLID FLASH™ NVM management and is therefore independent from the HSL. The NRG is not part of the TOE
Security Functionality (TSF).

Deselecting one of the optional libraries does not include the code implementing functionality, which the user
decided not to use. Not including the code of the deselected functionality has no impact of any other security
policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the situation where the user decides just not to use the functionality.

All optional software libraries are stored respectively can be loaded into the SOLID FLASH™ NVM.
All other Smartcard Embedded Software loaded into the SOLID FLASH™ NVM does not belong to the TOE and
is not subject of the evaluation.

1                     Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)
1.1                 Security Target and Target of Evaluation Reference
The title of this document is Security Target Lite Common Criteria EAL6 augmented / EAL6+ M7892 Design Step P11.

This     document     comprises    the     Infineon   Technologies    AG    Security   Controller    (Integrated   Circuit   IC),
M7892 Design Step P11, with specific IC dedicated firmware and optional software:

            RSA v2.03.008 or v2.07.003,

            EC v2.03.008 or v2.07.003,

            SHA-2 v1.01

            Toolbox v2.03.008 or v2.07.003

            Symmetric Crypto Library v2.02.010

In addition, the TOE is available with alternative firmware packages as versioned in Table 1: Identification.

The target of evaluation (TOE) M7892 Design Step P11 is described in the following.

The reference to the belonging confidential Security Target is given in chapter 9.

The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is the Infineon Security Controller, M7892 Design Step P11, with the optional libraries
RSA2048/4096 v2.03.008 or v2.07.003, EC v2.03.008 or v2.07.003, SHA-2 v1.01, Toolbox v2.03.008 or v2.07.003 , and
symmetric crypto library v2.02.010, as well as with specific IC dedicated firmware, including the Flash Loader enhanced by
the Mutual Authentication Extension (MAE).

The version of ECC, RSA and Toolbox libraries cannot be chosen independently. The libraries have to be of one version.

The design step of this TOE is P11.

The Security Target is based on the Protection Profile PP-0084 “Security IC Platform Protection Profile with Augmentation
Packages” [12] as publicly available for download at https://www.bsi.bund.de and certified under BSI-CC-PP-0084-2014. MAE
and Flash Loader are regarded by the definition of “loader package1+” according to “PP0084: Interpretations” [35].

The Protection Profile and the Security Target are built in compliance with Common Criteria v3.1.

The Security Target takes into account all relevant current final interpretations.

This TOE concept is based on the architecture, family concept and principles of the Integrity Guard implemented in the
controllers by Infineon Technologies AG deemed for high security requiring applications.

This TOE is based and built from the equal design sources as already certified in the forerunner process BSI-DSZ-CC-0891-V4-
2019 and has seen further improvements.

The certification body of this process is the German BSI, whereas the abbreviation stands for Federal Office for Information
Security, in German Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik.

The user can identify the TOE and its configuration using the Non-ISO ATR in combination with firmware functions. The TOE
answers the Non-ISO ATR with the Generic Chip Identification Mode (GCIM). The GCIM outputs a chip identifier byte, design
step, firmware identifier version and further configuration information. The identification data and configuration details are
described in the confidential Security Target [10] and in the Family Hardware Reference Manual HRM [1].

Furthermore, the MAE can be identified utilising its version, as described in the Production and personalization Mutual
Authentication Extension [36]. The version is part of the “basic chip information” provided by the command
FLASH_GET_CHIP_STATUS.

This TOE is represented by various products, differentiated by various configuration possibilities, done either by Infineon
settings during production or, after delivery, by means of blocking at customer premises.

Despite these configuration possibilities, all products are derived from the equal hardware design results, the M7892 Design
Step P11. The GCIM mode is explained and detailed in the user guidance document hardware reference manual HRM [1].

All product derivatives are identically from module design, layout and footprint, but are made different in their possibilities
to connect to different types of antennas or to a contact based interface only. Therefore, the TOE is represented and made
out of different mask sets:
The main difference between the mask sets of the TOE is on one metal mask (M1) to implement different input capacitances
in the analogue part of the radio frequency interface (RFI). This differentiation in the input capacitances allows the
connection to a wider range of various antenna types, or respectively, to a contact based interface only. Note that external
antennas or interfaces are not part of the TOE.

An overview upon the different mask sets is provided in the Confidential Security Target [10].

To each of the capacitances related mask sets belonging to the TOE, an individual value is assigned, which is part of the data
output of the Generic Chip Identification Mode (GCIM). This number is located in the GCIM part individual length byte to
clearly differentiate between the mask sets related to the different input capacitances. Thereby, the clear identification of
the silicon design step is given.

There are no other differences between the mask sets the TOE is produced with. Details are explained in the user guidance
hardware reference manual HRM [1]. An overview upon the different mask sets is given in the confidential Security Target
[10].

The M7892 Design Step P11 allows for a maximum of configuration possibilities defined by the customer order or his blocking
following the market needs. For example, a M7892 Design Step P11 product can come in one project with the fully available
                        1
SOLID FLASH™ NVM or in another project with any other SOLID FLASH™ NVM -size below the physical implementation size,
or with a different RAM size. And more, the user has the free choice, whether he needs the symmetric coprocessor SCP, or
the asymmetric coprocessor Crypto@2304T, or both, or none of them. In addition, the user decides, whether the TOE comes
with a free combination of software libraries or without any. However, the version of ECC, RSA and Toolbox libraries cannot
be chosen independently. If selected the libraries have to be of one version. And, to be even more flexible, various interface
options can be chosen as well. To sum up the major selections, the user defines by his order:

             The available memory sizes of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM and RAM.
              Note that there is no user available ROM on the TOE.

             The availability of the cryptographic coprocessors.

             The availability of the optional cryptographic libraries.

             The availability of Mutual Authentication Extension (MAE) and Flash Loader for available interfaces like ISO-7816,
              contactless ISO-14443.

             The availability of various interface options.

             The possibility to tailor the product by blocking on his own premises.

             The degree of freedom of the chip configuration is predefined by Infineon Technologies AG and made available via
              the order tool.

Beside fix TOE configurations, which can be ordered as usual, this TOE implements optionally the so called Bill-Per-Use (BPU)
ability. This solution enables our customer to tailor the product on his own to the required configuration – project by project.
By that BPU allows for significant reduction of logistic cost at all participating parties and serves for acceleration of delivery of
tailored product to the end-user.

BPU enables our customers to block the chip on demand into the final configuration at his own premises, without further
delivery or involving support by Infineon Technology Further information is given in the confidential Security Target [10].

The entire configuration storage area is protected against manipulation, perturbation and false access. Note that the IFX-only
part of the configuration page is already access protected prior delivery to the user and the TOE leaves the Infineon
Technology premises only locked into User Mode.

The Flash Loader BPU software part is only present on the products which have been ordered with the BPU option. In all
other cases this software is not present on the product. If a product is ordered without Flash Loader, also the Flash Loader
software is not present and the BPU configuration changes are blocked in the IFX-configuration, which renders BPU
functionality unusable. Various delivery combinations are given and for example, a product can come with a fix configuration
and with Flash Loader, to enable the user to download software, but without BPU option. Following cases can occur:

          
                                                                           1
              Order in fixed configuration, without activatable MAE and Flash Loader:
              no download of user software and no blocking possibility after delivery

             Order in fixed configuration with activatable MAE and Flash Loader but without BPU option:
              download of user software but no blocking possibility after delivery

             Order with activatable MAE and Flash Loader and Bill-per-Use option in starting configuration:
              final chip configuration by the user and download of user software

In case a customer decides to order the TOE with activatable MAE and Flash Loader, he has to make sure that the Flash
Loader is protected against misuse. This explicitly includes the delivery process from Infineon to the customer. In addition,
the Flash Loader has to be used in an MSSR-audited environment. Furthermore, the Flash Loader (and MAE) has to be

    „Activatable MAE“ means either that MAE is installed and will be active after power-up / reset of the TOE, or that MAE can be reinstalled
      and activated via the Flash Loader.

deactivated permanently before chips are delivered to the end-customer. These aspects are not within the scope of this
evaluation but have to be considered for a composite TOE.

Beside the various TOE configurations further possibilities of how the user inputs his software on the TOE, i.e. the operating
system and applications, are in place. This provides a maximum of flexibility and for this an overview is given in the following

For the cases with activatable MAE and Flash Loader on board and whenever the user has finalized his software download,
respectively the TOE is in the final state and about to be delivered to the end-user, the user is obligated to lock the Flash
Loader. The locking is the final step and results in a permanent deactivation of the Flash Loader. This means that once being
in the locked status, the Flash Loader cannot be reactivated anymore. In locked state it is also impossible to re-install/activate
the MAE (as this would need an active Flash Loader).

Note that whenever a TOE comes with a permanently deactivated the Flash Loader, BPU is not possible.

The following listing contains the memory size ranges and other blocking options, focusing on the maximum respectively
minimum user available limitations. Within those limitations the TOE configurations can vary under only one identical IC-
hardware, regardless whether the configurations are set by Infineon or within further limitations by the user. All
configurations the TOE is made off and all thereof resulting derivatives have no impact on security and are covered by the

There are further communication modes and blocking options available which are outlined in the confidential Security Target
[10] and the confidential User Guidance.

All possible TOE configurations equal and/or within the physical specified ranges as outlined in the confidential Security
Target [10] and in the hardware reference manual HRM [1] are covered by the certificate.

Note that there is no user available on-chip ROM module anymore. The user software and data are now located in a
dedicated and protected part of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The long life storage endurance, the automatic management of
often used memory pages, together with the means for error detection and correction serves for comparable respectively
equal reliability and endurance, compared to a conventional ROM.

Beside the above listed flexible ranges, the user guidance contains a number of predefined configurations for those
customers not making use of the BPU option. All of these configurations belong to the TOE as well and are of course made of
the equal hardware and are inside the above declared ranges.

According to the BPU option, a non-limited number of configurations of the TOE may occur in the field. The number of
various configurations depends on the user and purchase contract only.

Note that the TOE answers to the Non-ISO-ATR with the Generic Chip Identification Mode (GCIM) answer. This GCIM outputs
a coded clear identifier for the chip type, the design step and further configuration information such as the firmware version.
The user guidance document hardware reference manual HRM [1] enables for clear interpretation of the read out GCIM data.

These GCIM data enable the user for clear identification of the TOE and also of one of the different mask sets and therewith
for checking the validity of the certificate.

In addition, a dedicated RMS function allows reading out the present configuration in detail. Together with the programmer’s
reference manual (PRM) [3], this allows for clear identification of a product and its configuration.

All these steps for gathering identification and detailed configuration information can be done by the user himself, without
involving Infineon Technologies AG.

The TOE consists of the hardware part, the firmware parts and the optional software parts. The Smartcard Embedded
Software, i.e. the operating system and applications are not part of the TOE.

The firmware parts are the RMS, the Service Algorithm Minimal (SAM) the STS firmware for test purpose, the NRG software
interface routines, as well as the MAE enhanced Flash Loader for downloading user software to the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. For
further details regarding the firmware refer to chapter 2.2.2.Firmware patches (if there are any present) are stored in the
SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The TOE has no user ROM. IFX ROM contains no user data.

Please note that the NRG software is not part of the security functionality of the TOE.
                                                                                     1    2        3

These libraries provide the Smartcard Embedded Software with a certain functionality via an API. However, the Base Library
does not provided a dedicated functionality on its own and is mainly used internally by the RSA, EC and Toolbox libraries. If
none of the libraries RSA, EC and Toolbox is delivered, also the Base Library is not on board.

Thus the customer can choose, whether the TOE is delivered including - in free combinations - the functionality of the
cryptographic libraries SCL, EC, RSA, SHA-2 and the supporting Toolbox library. However, the version of ECC, RSA and Toolbox
libraries cannot be chosen independently. If selected the libraries have to be of one version. If RSA or EC or Toolbox is
delivered, automatically the Base Library is part of the shipment too.

If the user decides not to use one or all of the crypto library(s), the specific library(s) is (are) not delivered to the user and the
accompanying additional specific security functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and/ or EC and/or SHA-2 and/or SCL
based Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and SCL based Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES) is/are not provided by the
TOE.

The optional Toolbox library provides the user with basic arithmetic and modular arithmetic operations, in order to support
user software development using long integer operations. These basic arithmetic operations do not provide any security
functionality, implement no security mechanism, and do not provide additional specific security functionality - as defined for
the cryptographic libraries.
The user developed software using the Toolbox basic operations is not part of the TOE.

The Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF) of this TOE and does not provide any security functional
requirement.

The Base Library provides the low level interface to the asymmetric cryptographic coprocessor for the RSA, EC and Toolbox
libraries. The Base Library does not provide any dedicated security functionality on its own.

Deselecting one of the libraries does not include the code implementing functionality, which the user decided not to use. Not
including the code of the deselected functionality has no impact of any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly
equivalent to the situation where the user decides just not to use the functionality.

The SCL, RSA, EC, SHA-2 and Toolbox libraries can be loaded, together with the Smartcard Embedded software, into the
SOLID FLASH™ NVM. This holds also for the Base Library, if the RSA, EC or Toolbox or combinations hereof is/are part of the
shipment.

The Smartcard Embedded Software does not belong to the TOE and is not subject of the evaluation.


1.2                Target of Evaluation overview
The TOE comprises the Infineon Technologies Dual Interface Security Controller M7892 Design Step P11 with specific IC
dedicated firmware and optional SCL, RSA, EC, SHA-2 and Toolbox libraries.

The TOE is a member of the Infineon Technologies AG high security controller family meeting the highest requirements in
terms of performance and security. A summary product description is given in this Security Target (ST).

This TOE is intended to be used in any application and device requiring the highest level of security, and can be used for
example not only as a secure smart card, but also as a secure element on a printed circuit board or similar. The capabilities of
this TOE can be used almost everywhere, where highly secure applications are in use and of course in any other application
as well. This TOE is deemed for governmental, corporate, transport and payment markets, or wherever a secure root of trust

is required. Various types of applications can use this TOE in almost any device or form factor, for example in closed loop
logical access controls, physical access controls, secure internet access control and internet authentication, or as multi-
application token or simply as encrypted storage.

This member of the high security controller family features a security philosophy focusing on data integrity instead of
numerous sensors. By that two main principles combined in close synergy are utilized in the security concept called the
“Integrity Guard”. These main principles are the comprehensive error detection, including the dual CPU, and the full
encrypted data path, leaving no plain data on the chip. These principles proved that they provide excellent protection against
invasive and non-invasive attacks known today.
                                                                                                                                 2
The intelligent shielding algorithm finishes the layers, finally providing the so called intelligent implicit active shielding “I -
shield”. This provides physical protection against probing and forcing.

This dual interface controller is able to communicate using either the contact based or the contactless interface. The
implemented dual interface provides a maximum flexibility in using following communication protocols respectively
methods:

Contact based interfaces

               ISO 7816
                The ISO defined standard contact based communication protocol, using the pads.

Contactless interfaces

               And various further communication modes (see Note below).

Note:         All interfaces and protocols can be made available sequentially. How the interfaces are used or combined depends
exclusively on the user software. Further communication modes, details and an overview about their combinations are
outlined in the confidential Security Target [9].

The TOE provides a real 16-bit CPU-architecture and is compatible to the MCS®251 instruction set with an execution time
faster than a standard MCS®251 microcontroller at the same clock frequency. The major components of the core system are
the dual CPU (Central Processing Units), acting as one, the MMU (Memory Management Unit) and MED (Memory
Encryption/Decryption Unit). The dual CPU controls each other in order to detect faults and serve by this for data integrity.
The TOE implements a full 16 MByte linear addressable memory space for each privilege level, a simple scalable Memory

Management concept and a scalable stack size. The flexible memory concept consists of ROM- and Flash-memory as part of
the nonvolatile memory (NVM), respectively SOLID FLASH™ NVM. For the SOLID FLASH™ NVM the Unified Channel
Programming (UCP) memory technology is used.

The RMS library providing some functionality via an API to the Smartcard Embedded Software contains for example SOLID
FLASH™ NVM service routines. The Service Algorithm Minimal (SAM) provides functionality for the tearing-safe write into the
SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The STS firmware is used for test purposes during start-up and the MAE and Flash Loader allow for
mutual authentication with the TOE and secure downloading of user software to the SOLID FLASH™ NVM during the
manufacturing process. The firmware parts are implemented in the ROM and in access protected areas of the SOLID FLASH™
NVM.

The BSI has changed names and abbreviations for Random Number Generators, which is clarified as follows: The Physical
True Random Number Generator (PTRNG), also named True Random Number Generator (TRNG) is afreely be combined but not two versions of the equal type. For examples ACL with SCL with
HSL with NRG is welcome but a combination of HSL in version 03.11.8339 and at the same time with HSL in
version 01.22.4346 would not work. The library types are entirely independent from each other.
The security relevant differences in the versions - if any - are detailed in chapter 8. The claims of this Security
Target take the corresponding versions into account and thus the wording in the following refers to the library
type which is cited or else the claim includes always all named versions.

The design step of this TOE is H13.

The Security Target is based on the Protection Profile PP-0084 Security IC Platform Protection Profile with
Augmentation Packages [9] as publicly available for download at https://www.bsi.bund.de and certified under
BSI-CC-PP-0084-2014.
The Security Target is built in compliance with Common Criteria v3.1 Revision 5.

The Security Target takes into account all relevant current final interpretations.

 BSI – Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik – Federal Office for Information Security: Following the national BSI
    recommendations, RSA key lengths below 1976 bits are not included in the certificate. Please note that the BSI expects this key length
    as appropriate until 2022 and recommends for longer usage times key lengths of 3000 bits or higher.

number generation as a security service to the user and for internal purposes. The produced genuine random numbers can
be used directly or as seed for the Deterministic Random Number Generator (DRNG), formerly named as Pseudo Random

is senpnal AIS32 regulation regarding the 100
bit security level issued by the BSI1. This regulation excludes the single DES operation from the certification as it
is considered to be not sufficiently secure from algorithm perspective.
For both versions, the certification covers the SCL cryptographic functionality of the AES algorithm with key
lengths of 128, 192, 256 bits and the TDEA or TripleDES (TDES) algorithm with an effective key size of 112 and
168 bits. For the version v2.04.002 the certification covers the CMAC functionality too.

Note that this TOE can come with both cryptographic co-processors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a
blocked Crypto2304T, or with both cryptographic co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the user’s
choice. No accessibility of the deselected cryptographic co-processors is without impact on any other security
policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the situation where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic
co-processors.

Beside the inclusion and support of cryptographic libraries this TOE comes with the optional Hardware Support
Library (HSL) in different alternative versions, significantly simplifying the management of the SOLID FLASH™
NVM functionality. The HSL constitutes an application interface (API) accessing the HSL state machine and
abstracting low level properties like special function registers and settings of specific hardware features. In short
the HSL provides a user friendly also use case oriented interface considering endurance, reliability and
performance. In certain configurations the HSL provides also functions implementing tearing safe behaviour of
the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. If used the user has no need to care about cases where the TOE is suddenly cut off the
power supply even during managing the SOLID FLASH™ NVM.
Anyhow, the HSL remains as an optional library as even sudden power off situations does never lead to
exploitable conditions of the TOE. In the worse the TOE ends operation in case of a faulty programmed SOLID
FLASH™ NVM location due to the Integrity Guard.
In addition to the above, the HSL in version 03.12.8812 and 03.11.8339 provide an advanced additional method
called Incremental Write (IWR). This method provides enhanced endurance of the SOLID FLASH NVM even
beyond the erase endurance limits for often written objects. Thus this method serves applications with a demand
for high endurance and fast writing times. On the other hand, the read times using this method are slower than
the other methods provided.

The order option CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CIPURSE™ CL) provides cryptographic functionality to
implement a CIPURSE™ V2 conformant protocol.
This protocol provides a secure mutual authentication of two entities, namely the terminal (denoted as PCD =
Proximity Coupling Device (CIPURSE™-compliant terminal)) and a smart card or a token in other form factors
which is called PICC. PICC stands for Proximity Integrated Circuit Card (CIPURSE™-compliant card).
Beside the mutual authentication, the protocol implements measures to maintain the integrity of the transferred
data and preserves in parallel the confidentiality of the transferred data.
By that the CIPURSE™ CL supports the user to implement systems conformant to the CIPURSE™ open standard
implementing a secured, interoperable and flexible transit fare collection solution, including ISO 7816, ISO/IEC
14443-4 communication and AES-128 bit cryptography for multiple payment types.

Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)


By that the CIPURSE™ CL supports the user to implement systems conformant to the CIPURSE™ open standard
implementing a secured, interoperable and flexible transit fare collection solution, including ISO 7816, ISO/IEC
14443-4 communication and AES-128 bit cryptography for multiple payment types.
The order option of the CIPURSE™ CL is conformant to the CIPURSE™ open standard [18] for both, the PICC and
then PCD software parts. It implements the by the OSPT alliance standardized application interface for the card
and the terminal side.
The scope of this certification of this TOE covers all parts of the CIPURSE™ CL which are later implemented by
the user on the user card respectively token based on this TOE and the functionality of the PCD software part
which is implemented in the terminal side. The PCD software operates also on the hardware of this TOE which is
implemented in the terminal.
The CIPURSE™ CL implements the by the OSPT alliance standardized application interface for the card and the
terminal side.

The NRG Software is a further order option and implements the routines for a NRG interface. The NRG
implements an operating system handling the emulation of an NRG card together with the RF interface. One
part of the NRG is permanently stored in the ROM and the second part consisting of patch and API is located in
the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The second part is only present if the NRG is part of the delivery. If the NRG is not part
of the delivery the ROM part is present but not used. The NRG implements tearing safe behaviour in context with
the SOLID FLASH™ NVM management and is therefore independent from the HSL. The NRG is not part of the
TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

To fulfill the highest security requirements for smartcards today and also in the future, this TOE implements a
progressive digital security concept, which already has been certified in various forerunner processes. This TOE
utilizes digital security features to include customer friendly security, combined with a robust design overcoming
the disadvantages on analogue protection technologies. The TOE provides full on-chip encryption covering the
complete core, busses, memories and cryptographic co-processors leaving no plain data on the chip. A further
security feature has been implemented for this TOE protecting also the involved addresses transferred over the
memory bus. Therefore the attractiveness for attackers is a step further extremely reduced as encrypted signals
are of no use for the attacker – neither for manipulation nor for eavesdropping.
In addition, the TOE is equipped with a comprehensive error detection capability for the complete data path. The
dual CPU approach allows error detection even while processing. A comparator detects whether a calculation
was performed without errors. This approach does not leave any parts of the core circuitry unprotected. The
concept allows that the relevant attack scenarios are detected, whereas other conditions that would not lead to
an error would mainly be ignored. That renders the TOE robust against environmental influences.
Furthermore, the TOE implements what we call intelligent implicit shielding (I2). These measures constitute a
shield on sensitive and security critical signals which is not recognizable or obvious as a shield. This provides
excellent protection against invasive physical attacks, such as probing, forcing or similar.
In this Security Target the TOE is briefly described and a summary specification is given. The security
environment of the TOE durlock cipher modes as declared in this document and covering a wide range
of applications, the SCL offers in addition the flexibility to implement additional block cipher modes defined by
the user.
This library provides a simplified interface to the hardware Symmetric Cryptographic Coprocessor (SCP) and
preserves the security and performance requirements as required by the user.
Note that the definition of the key lengths follows the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100 bit security
level by the BSI. This excludes the single DES operation from the certification.

Beside the inclusion and support of cryptographic libraries this TOE comes with the optional Hardware Support
Library (HSL) in different versions significantly simplifying the management of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM
functionality. The HSL constitutes an application interface (API) accessing the HSL state machine and
abstracting low level properties like special function registers and settings of specific hardware features. In short
the HSL provides a user friendly also useing its different phases of the lifecycle is defined. The assets are identified which
have to be protected through the security policy. The threats against these assets are described. The security
objectives and the security policy are defined, as well as the security requirements. These security requirements
are built out of the security functional requirements as part of the security policy and the security assurance
requirements. These are the formal steps applied during the evaluation and certification showing that the TOE
meets the targeted requirements. In additi case oriented interface considering endurance, reliability and
performance requirements.
In certain configurations each of the HSL versions provide also functions implementing tearing safe behavon, simplified functionality of the TOE matching the requirements is
described.

1                     Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)
1.1                 Security Target and Target of Evaluation Reference
The title of this document is Security Target Lite Common Criteria EAL6 augmented / EAL6+ M7892 Design Step P11.

This     document     comprises    the     Infineon   Technologies    AG    Security   Controller    (Integrated   Circuit   IC),
M7892 Design Step P11, with specific IC dedicated firmware and optional software:

            RSA v2.03.008 or v2.07.003,

            EC v2.03.008 or v2.07.003,

            SHA-2 v1.01

            Toolbox v2.03.008 or v2.07.003

            Symmetric Crypto Library v2.02.010

In addition, the TOE is available with alternative firmware packages as versioned in Table 1: Identification.

The target of evaluation (TOE) M7892 Design Step P11 is described in the following.

The reference to the belonging confidential Security Target is given in chapter 9.

The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is the Infineon Security Controller, M7892 Design Step P11, with the optional libraries
RSA2048/4096 v2.03.008 or v2.07.003, EC v2.03.008 or v2.07.003, SHA-2 v1.01, Toolbox v2.03.008 or v2.07.003 , and
symmetric crypto library v2.02.010, as well as with specific IC dedicated firmware, including the Flash Loader enhanced by
the Mutual Authentication Extension (MAE).

The version of ECC, RSA and Toolbox libraries cannot be chosen independently. The libraries have to be of one version.

The design step of this TOE is P11.

The Security Target is based on the Protection Profile PP-0084 “Security IC Platform Protection Profile with Augmentation
Packages” [12] as publicly available for download at https://www.bsi.bund.de and certified under BSI-CC-PP-0084-2014. MAE
and Flash Loader are regarded by the definition of “loader package1+” according to “PP0084: Interpretations” [35].

The Protection Profile and the Security Target are built in compliance with Common Criteria v3.1.

The Security Target takes into account all relevant current final interpretations.

This TOE concept is based on the architecture, family concept and principles of the Integrity Guard implemented in the
controllers by Infineon Technologies AG deemed for high security requiring applications.

This TOE is based and built from the equal design sources as already certified in the forerunner process BSI-DSZ-CC-0891-V4-
2019 and has seen further improvements.

The certification body of this process is the German BSI, whereas the abbreviation stands for Federal Office for Information
Security, in German Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik.

The user can identify the TOE and its configuration using the Non-ISO ATR in combination with firmware functions. The TOE
answers the Non-ISO ATR with the Generic Chip Identification Mode (GCIM). The GCIM outputs a chip identifier byte, design
step, firmware identifier version and further configuration information. The identification data and configuration details are
described in the confidential Security Target [10] and in the Family Hardware Reference Manual HRM [1].

Furthermore, the MAE can be identified utilising its version, as described in the Production and personalization Mutual
Authentication Extension [36]. The version is part of the “basic chip information” provided by the command
FLASH_GET_CHIP_STATUS.

This TOE is represented by various products, differentiated by various configuration possibilities, done either by Infineon
settings during production or, after delivery, by means of blocking at customer premises.

Despite these configuration possibilities, all products are derived from the equal hardware design results, the M7892 Design
Step P11. The GCIM mode is explained and detailed in the user guidance document hardware reference manual HRM [1].

All product derivatives are identically from module design, layout and footprint, but are made different in their possibilities
to connect to different types of antennas or to a contact based interface only. Therefore, the TOE is represented and made
out of different mask sets:
The main difference between the mask sets of the TOE is on one metal mask (M1) to implement different input capacitances
in the analogue part of the radio frequency interface (RFI). This differentiation in the input capacitances allows the
connection to a wider range of various antenna types, or respectively, to a contact based interface only. Note that external
antennas or interfaces are not part of the TOE.

An overview upon the different mask sets is provided in the Confidential Security Target [10].

To each of the capacitances related mask sets belonging to the TOE, an individual value is assigned, which is part of the data
output of the Generic Chip Identification Mode (GCIM). This number is located in the GCIM part individual length byte to
clearly differentiate between the mask sets related to the different input capacitances. Thereby, the clear identification of
the silicon design step is given.

There are no other differences between the mask sets the TOE is produced with. Details are explained in the user guidance
hardware reference manual HRM [1]. An overview upon the different mask sets is given in the confidential Security Target
[10].

The M7892 Design Step P11 allows for a maximum of configuration possibilities defined by the customer order or his blocking
following the market needs. For example, a M7892 Design Step P11 product can come in one project with the fully available
                        1
SOLID FLASH™ NVM or in another project with any other SOLID FLASH™ NVM -size below the physical implementation size,
or with a different RAM size. And more, the user has the free choice, whether he needs the symmetric coprocessor SCP, or
the asymmetric coprocessor Crypto@2304T, or both, or none of them. In addition, the user decides, whether the TOE comes
with a free combination of software libraries or without any. However, the version of ECC, RSA and Toolbox libraries cannot
be chosen independently. If selected the libraries have to be of one version. And, to be even more flexible, various interface
options can be chosen as well. To sum up the major selections, the user defines by his order:

             The available memory sizes of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM and RAM.
              Note that there is no user available ROM on the TOE.

             The availability of the cryptographic coprocessors.

             The availability of the optional cryptographic libraries.

             The availability of Mutual Authentication Extension (MAE) and Flash Loader for available interfaces like ISO-7816,
              contactless ISO-14443.

             The availability of various interface options.

             The possibility to tailor the product by blocking on his own premises.

             The degree of freedom of the chip configuration is predefined by Infineon Technologies AG and made available via
              the order tool.

Beside fix TOE configurations, which can be ordered as usual, this TOE implements optionally the so called Bill-Per-Use (BPU)
ability. This solution enables our customer to tailor the product on his own to the required configuration – project by project.
By that BPU allows for significant reduction of logistic cost at all participating parties and serves for acceleration of delivery of
tailored product to the end-user.

BPU enables our customers to block the chip on demand into the final configuration at his own premises, without further
delivery or involving support by Infineon Technology Further information is given in the confidential Security Target [10].

The entire configuration storage area is protected against manipulation, perturbation and false access. Note that the IFX-only
part of the configuration page is already access protected prior delivery to the user and the TOE leaves the Infineon
Technology premises only locked into User Mode.

The Flash Loader BPU software part is only present on the products which have been ordered with the BPU option. In all
other cases this software is not present on the product. If a product is ordered without Flash Loader, also the Flash Loader
software is not present and the BPU configuration changes are blocked in the IFX-configuration, which renders BPU
functionality unusable. Various delivery combinations are given and for example, a product can come with a fix configuration
and with Flash Loader, to enable the user to download software, but without BPU option. Following cases can occur:

          
                                                                           1
              Order in fixed configuration, without activatable MAE and Flash Loader:
              no download of user software and no blocking possibility after delivery

             Order in fixed configuration with activatable MAE and Flash Loader but without BPU option:
              download of user software but no blocking possibility after delivery

             Order with activatable MAE and Flash Loader and Bill-per-Use option in starting configuration:
              final chip configuration by the user and download of user software

In case a customer decides to order the TOE with activatable MAE and Flash Loader, he has to make sure that the Flash
Loader is protected against misuse. This explicitly includes the delivery process from Infineon to the customer. In addition,
the Flash Loader has to be used in an MSSR-audited environment. Furthermore, the Flash Loader (and MAE) has to be

    „Activatable MAE“ means either that MAE is installed and will be active after power-up / reset of the TOE, or that MAE can be reinstalled
      and activated via the Flash Loader.

deactivated permanently before chips are delivered to the end-customer. These aspects are not within the scope of this
evaluation but have to be considered for a composite TOE.

Beside the various TOE configurations further possibilities of how the user inputs his software on the TOE, i.e. the operating
system and applications, are in place. This provides a maximum of flexibility and for this an overview is given in the following

For the cases with activatable MAE and Flash Loader on board and whenever the user has finalized his software download,
respectively the TOE is in the final state and about to be delivered to the end-user, the user is obligated to lock the Flash
Loader. The locking is the final step and results in a permanent deactivation of the Flash Loader. This means that once being
in the locked status, the Flash Loader cannot be reactivated anymore. In locked state it is also impossible to re-install/activate
the MAE (as this would need an active Flash Loader).

Note that whenever a TOE comes with a permanently deactivated the Flash Loader, BPU is not possible.

The following listing contains the memory size ranges and other blocking options, focusing on the maximum respectively
minimum user available limitations. Within those limitations the TOE configurations can vary under only one identical IC-
hardware, regardless whether the configurations are set by Infineon or within further limitations by the user. All
configurations the TOE is made off and all thereof resulting derivatives have no impact on security and are covered by the

There are further communication modes and blocking options available which are outlined in the confidential Security Target
[10] and the confidential User Guidance.

All possible TOE configurations equal and/or within the physical specified ranges as outlined in the confidential Security
Target [10] and in the hardware reference manual HRM [1] are covered by the certificate.

Note that there is no user available on-chip ROM module anymore. The user software and data are now located in a
dedicated and protected part of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The long life storage endurance, the automatic management of
often used memory pages, together with the means for error detection and correction serves for comparable respectively
equal reliability and endurance, compared to a conventional ROM.

Beside the above listed flexible ranges, the user guidance contains a number of predefined configurations for those
customers not making use of the BPU option. All of these configurations belong to the TOE as well and are of course made of
the equal hardware and are inside the above declared ranges.

According to the BPU option, a non-limited number of configurations of the TOE may occur in the field. The number of
various configurations depends on the user and purchase contract only.

Note that the TOE answers to the Non-ISO-ATR with the Generic Chip Identification Mode (GCIM) answer. This GCIM outputs
a coded clear identifier for the chip type, the design step and further configuration information such as the firmware version.
The user guidance document hardware reference manual HRM [1] enables for clear interpretation of the read out GCIM data.

These GCIM data enable the user for clear identification of the TOE and also of one of the different mask sets and therewith
for checking the validity of the certificate.

In addition, a dedicated RMS function allows reading out the present configuration in detail. Together with the programmer’s
reference manual (PRM) [3], this allows for clear identification of a product and its configuration.

All these steps for gathering identification and detailed configuration information can be done by the user himself, without
involving Infineon Technologies AG.

The TOE consists of the hardware part, the firmware parts and the optional software parts. The Smartcard Embedded
Software, i.e. the operating system and applications are not part of the TOE.

The firmware parts are the RMS, the Service Algorithm Minimal (SAM) the STS firmware for test purpose, the NRG software
interface routines, as well as the MAE enhanced Flash Loader for downloading user software to the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. For
further details regarding the firmware refer to chapter 2.2.2.Firmware patches (if there are any present) are stored in the
SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The TOE has no user ROM. IFX ROM contains no user data.

Please note that the NRG software is not part of the security functionality of the TOE.
                                                                                     1    2        3

These libraries provide the Smartcard Embedded Software with a certain functionality via an API. However, the Base Library
does not provided a dedicated functionality on its own and is mainly used internally by the RSA, EC and Toolbox libraries. If
none of the libraries RSA, EC and Toolbox is delivered, also the Base Library is not on board.

Thus the customer can choose, whether the TOE is delivered including - in free combinations - the functionality of the
cryptographic libraries SCL, EC, RSA, SHA-2 and the supporting Toolbox library. However, the version of ECC, RSA and Toolbox
libraries cannot be chosen independently. If selected the libraries have to be of one version. If RSA or EC or Toolbox is
delivered, automatically the Base Library is part of the shipment too.

If the user decides not to use one or all of the crypto library(s), the specific library(s) is (are) not delivered to the user and the
accompanying additional specific security functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and/ or EC and/or SHA-2 and/or SCL
based Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and SCL based Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES) is/are not provided by the
TOE.

The optional Toolbox library provides the user with basic arithmetic and modular arithmetic operations, in order to support
user software development using long integer operations. These basic arithmetic operations do not provide any security
functionality, implement no security mechanism, and do not provide additional specific security functionality - as defined for
the cryptographic libraries.
The user developed software using the Toolbox basic operations is not part of the TOE.

The Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF) of this TOE and does not provide any security functional
requirement.

The Base Library provides the low level interface to the asymmetric cryptographic coprocessor for the RSA, EC and Toolbox
libraries. The Base Library does not provide any dedicated security functionality on its own.

Deselecting one of the libraries does not include the code implementing functionality, which the user decided not to use. Not
including the code of the deselected functionality has no impact of any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly
equivalent to the situation where the user decides just not to use the functionality.

The SCL, RSA, EC, SHA-2 and Toolbox libraries can be loaded, together with the Smartcard Embedded software, into the
SOLID FLASH™ NVM. This holds also for the Base Library, if the RSA, EC or Toolbox or combinations hereof is/are part of the
shipment.

The Smartcard Embedded Software does not belong to the TOE and is not subject of the evaluation.


1.2                Target of Evaluation overview
The TOE comprises the Infineon Technologies Dual Interface Security Controller M7892 Design Step P11 with specific IC
dedicated firmware and optional SCL, RSA, EC, SHA-2 and Toolbox libraries.

The TOE is a member of the Infineon Technologies AG high security controller family meeting the highest requirements in
terms of performance and security. A summary product description is given in this Security Target (ST).

This TOE is intended to be used in any application and device requiring the highest level of security, and can be used for
example not only as a secure smart card, but also as a secure element on a printed circuit board or similar. The capabilities of
this TOE can be used almost everywhere, where highly secure applications are in use and of course in any other application
as well. This TOE is deemed for governmental, corporate, transport and payment markets, or wherever a secure root of trust

is required. Various types of applications can use this TOE in almost any device or form factor, for example in closed loop
logical access controls, physical access controls, secure internet access control and internet authentication, or as multi-
application token or simply as encrypted storage.

This member of the high security controller family features a security philosophy focusing on data integrity instead of
numerous sensors. By that two main principles combined in close synergy are utilized in the security concept called the
“Integrity Guard”. These main principles are the comprehensive error detection, including the dual CPU, and the full
encrypted data path, leaving no plain data on the chip. These principles proved that they provide excellent protection against
invasive and non-invasive attacks known today.
                                                                                                                                 2
The intelligent shielding algorithm finishes the layers, finally providing the so called intelligent implicit active shielding “I -
shield”. This provides physical protection against probing and forcing.

This dual interface controller is able to communicate using either the contact based or the contactless interface. The
implemented dual interface provides a maximum flexibility in using following communication protocols respectively
methods:

Contact based interfaces

               ISO 7816
                The ISO defined standard contact based communication protocol, using the pads.

Contactless interfaces

               ISO 14443 Type A and Type B
                These are ISO defined proximity contactless protocols using an external antenna and the TOE implemented
                analogue and digital radio frequency interface.

               ISO/IEC 18092 passive mode,
                The ISO defined proximity contactless protocol using an external antenna and the TOE implemented analogue and
                digital radio frequency interface.

                digital radio frequency interface, as well as the memory part reserved for NRG use.

               And various further communication modes (see Note below).

Note:         All interfaces and protocols can be made available sequentially. How the interfaces are used or combined depends
exclusively on the user software. Further communication modes, details and an overview about their combinations are
outlined in the confidential Security Target [9].

The TOE provides a real 16-bit CPU-architecture and is compatible to the MCS®251 instruction set with an execution time
faster than a standard MCS®251 microcontroller at the same clock frequency. The major components of the core system are
the dual CPU (Central Processing Units), acting as one, the MMU (Memory Management Unit) and MED (Memory
Encryption/Decryption Unit). The dual CPU controls each other in order to detect faults and serve by this for data integrity.
The TOE implements a full 16 MByte linear addressable memory space for each privilege level, a simple scalable Memory

Management concept and a scalable stack size. The flexible memory concept consists of ROM- and Flash-memory as part of
the nonvolatile memory (NVM), respectively SOLID FLASH™ NVM. For the SOLID FLASH™ NVM the Unified Channel
Programming (UCP) memory technology is used.

The RMS library providing some functionality via an API to the Smartcard Embedded Software contains for example SOLID
FLASH™ NVM service routines. The Service Algorithm Minimal (SAM) provides functionality for the tearing-safe write into the
SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The STS firmware is used for test purposes during start-up and the MAE and Flash Loader allow for
mutual authentication with the TOE and secure downloading of user software to the SOLID FLASH™ NVM during the
manufacturing process. The firmware parts are implemented in the ROM and in access protected areas of the SOLID FLASH™
NVM.

The BSI has changed names and abbreviations for Random Number Generators, which is clarified as follows: The Physical
True Random Number Generator (PTRNG), also named True Random Number Generator (TRNG) is a physical random number
generator and meets the requirements of the functionality class AIS31 PTG.2, see [16]. It is used for provision of random
number generation as a security service to the user and for internal purposes. The produced genuine random numbers can
be used directly or as seed for the Deterministic Random Number Generator (DRNG), formerly named as Pseudo Random
Number Generator (PRNG). The DRNG respectively PRNG is not in the scope of the evaluation. The TRNG respectively PTRNG
is specially designed for smart cards, but can also be used in any other application where excellent physical random data are
required.

The two cryptographic coprocessors serve the need of modern cryptography: The symmetric coprocessor (SCP) combines
both AES and Triple-DES with dual-key or triple-key hardware acceleration. The Asymmetric Crypto Coprocessor, called
Crypto@2304T in the following, is an optimized version of the Crypto@1408 used in the SLE88-family with performance
improvements for RSA-2048 bit (4096-bit with CRT) and Elliptic Curve (EC) cryptography.

The software part of the TOE consists of the cryptographic SCL, RSA-, EC- and the SHA-2 libraries and the supporting Toolbox
and Base Libraries. If RSA or EC or Toolbox or combinations hereof are part of the shipment, automatically the Base Library is
included.

The RSA library is used to provide a high level interface to RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman) cryptography implemented on the
hardware component Crypto@2304T and includes countermeasures against SPA, DPA and DFA attacks. The routines are used
for the generation of RSA Key Pairs, the RSA signature verification, the RSA signature generation and the RSA modulus
recalculation. The hardware Crypto@2304T unit provides the basic long number calculations (add, subtract, multiply, square
with 1100 bit numbers) with high performance. The RSA library is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the
user software. The RSA library can perform RSA operations from 512 to 4096 bit.
                     1
Following the BSI recommendations, key lengths below 1976 bit are not included in the certificate.

The EC library is used to provide a high level interface to Elliptic Curve cryptography implemented on the hardware
component Crypto@2304T and includes countermeasures against SPA, DPA and DFA attacks. The routines are used for
ECDSA signature generation, ECDSA signature verification, ECDSA key generation and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key
agreement. In addition, the EC library provides an additional function for calculating primitive elliptic curve operations like
                                                                                         n

according user guidance the Elliptic Curve cryptographic functions are abbreviated using ECC.
The EC library is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software. The certification covers the
standard NIST [18] and Brainpool [19] Elliptic Curves with key lengths of 160, 163, 192, 224, 233, 256, 283, 320, 384, 409, 512
or 521 bit, due to national AIS32 regulations by the BSI. Numerous other curve types, being also secure in terms of side
channel attacks on this TOE, exist, which the user optionally can add in the composition certification process.

The SHA-2 library provides the calculation of a hash value of freely chosen data input in the CPU. The SHA-2 library is
delivered as object code and is in this way available for the user software. This secure hash-algorithm SHA-2 is intended to be
used for signature generation, verification and generic data integrity checks. The use for keyed hash operations like HMAC or
similar security critical operations involving keys, is not subject of this TOE and requires specific security improvements and

A customer can identify the TOE hardware and its configuration (for details see chapter 1.4.7) using the Non-ISO
ATR. The Non-ISO ATR outputs a Common Criteria Certification Identifier and firmware identifier, which links
the TOE to this ST. Specific firmware functions can be used to determine the exact configuration of a device
from the certified range defined in Table 3.
The TOE can be ordered with a preloaded image. This image contains NVM loader functionality and is called
PFL (Performance Flash Loader) with version v09.10.90.9. The PFL is intended to be used in a secured
environment only and is not part of the TOE.

The TOE hardware consists of a core, a memory system and peripherals.
The major components of the core system are a 32-bit CPU (Central Processing Unit), an MPU (Memory
Protection Unit), a Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC) and an Instruction Stream Signature Checking
(ISS).
The MPU of the core stores code and data in a linear 4-GByte memory space (32-bit range), allowing direct
access without the need to swap memory segments in and out of memory using a memory protection unit.
There are two separate bus entities: a memory bus and a peripheral bus for high-speed communication with
the peripherals.
The SPAU can be configured by the user to block or allow peripheral access. It can also be used to block RAM
areas (For keeping Figure 1 simple, the connection between SPAU and RAM is not shown). The CPAU enables
the user to block or allow unprivileged level access to NVM and specific registers of ICS and NVM.

Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)

The CPU accesses memory via the Internal Ciphering System (ICS), which encrypts/decrypts memory content.
All data of the memory block is encrypted. The NVM is equipped with an error correction code (ECC). Security
modules manage the alarms. Alarms may be triggered when the environmental conditions are outside the
specified operational range.
A set of sensors (temperature sensor, backside light detector, glitch sensor, low frequency sensor) is used to
detect excessive deviations from the specified operational range and serve for robustness of the TOE. The
UMSLC function can be used to test the alarm lines.
A Random Number Generator (RNG) consist of a physical Random Number Generator with a cryptographically
strong post processing unit. It can be operated in the modes as follows:
 True Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.2
 Hybrid Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.3
 Deterministic Random Number Generation (DRNG) AIS31 DRG.3 and DRG.4

The Symmetric Cryptographic Processor (SCP) implements calculation of dual-key or triple-key triple-DES and
AES.
The µSM4 supports the Chinese standard encryption algorithm SM4.
The Crypto2304T co-processor provides basic means optimized for the implementation of fast and secure
software of many asymmetric or public key cryptographic schemes like RSA or elliptic curve based ones. The
user accessibility of the Crypto2304T is a customer ordering option
The implemented sleep mode logic (clock stop mode per ISO/IEC 7816-3) is used to reduce overall power
consumption.
The TOE is able to communicate using either its contact based or contactless interface (RF interface). The
contact based interface allows to use the ISO 7816 protocol via the UART. Further it offers a GPIO and an I2C
slave interface. The contactless interface can be configured to RFI or ACLB mode. Both interface types support
the signaling modes as follows:
 Signalling mode ISO/IEC 14443, Type A and Type B
 Signalling mode ISO/IEC 18092 passive mode, Type F
 NRGҹ interface

The UMSLC enables the user software to check the activity and proper function of the system’s security
features.
The Clock Unit (CLKU) supplies the clocks for all components of the TOE. The Clock Unit can work in internal
and external clock mode. When operating the internal clock mode the system frequency is derived from an
oscillator, whereas in external clock mode, the system clock is derived from an externally supplied interface
clock.
The watchdog timer triggers an event in case of a counter overflow. The timers are general purpose up-
counting timers.
A CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) module computes a checksum value from a message or any other block of
data.
The ROM is used by IFX only. The user software has to be implemented in SOLID FLASHҹ memory. The user can
choose, whether the software is loaded into the SOLID FLASHҹ memory by Infineon Technologies AG or by the
user.
The TOE uses Special Function Registers (SFRs). These SFRs are used for general purposes and chip
configuration; they are located in SOLID FLASHҹ memory in a configuration area page. The Online

Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)

Configuration Check (OCC) function is used for register protection, i.e. controls the modification of relevant
SFR settings.
In case a security violation is detected, secure state is entered by the hardware.

1.4.1.2            Firmware and software components
The TOE provides low-level firmware components: the Boot Software (BOS), the Performance Optimized Write
Scheme (POWS) and the Flash Loader (FL).
The BOS firmware is used for test purposes during start-up and the FL allows downloading of user software to
the NVM during the manufacturing process. All mandatory functions for start-up and internal testing are
protected by a dedicated hardware firewall with two levels “BOS” and “user”.
The POWS library is an internal firmware library, i.e. not accessible by the user. It is used by the BOS and FL to
store data in NVM in a tearing safe manner.
The Flash Loader allows downloading of User Software into the NVM during the manufacturing process.
The software of the TOE consists of optional packages:
   NRGҹ SW: The optional NRGҹ SW supports Card and Reader Mode, e.g. card creation, personalization and
    deletion. The NRGҹ SW does not implement any security functionality
   HSL: The optional HSL provides functionality via APIs to the Smartcard Embedded Software . which
    contains SOLID FLASHҹ NVM service routines and functionality for tearing safe programming of SOLID
    FLASHҹ NVM.
   UMSLC lib: this library provides a wrapper around the UMSLC hardware functionality with measures to
    counter fault attacks.
   Symmetric Crypto Library (SCL): The optional SCL is used to provide a high level interface to the TDES and
    AES cryptography, which is partly implemented on the hardware component SCP and includes
    countermeasures against SPA, DPA and DFA attacks. The SCL is delivered as object code and in this way
    integrated into the user software.
   Asymmetric Crypto Library (ACL): The optional ACL implements RSA and elliptic curve based cryptographic
    schemes

1.4.1.3            User Guidance components
The user guidance consists of the components as follows:
   32-bit Security Controller – V11, Hardware Reference Manual: description of hardware features and user
    interfaces

1.4.2              Physical scope of the TOE
The physical scope of the TOE is defined by the TOE components described in chapter 1.4.1

1.4.3              Logical scope of the TOE
The logical scope of the TOE consists of the logical security features provided by the TOE. These features are
listed in chapter 1.3.2. More details are provided in this chapter:
   Cryptographic support: TDES, AES (block cipher modes ECB, CBC, CFB, CTR and CMAC), RNG (Hybrid
    Random Number Generator PTG.3, True Random Number Generator PTG.2, Deterministic Random Number
    generator DRG.3 and DRG.4 according to [BSI_RNGs]), RSA, ECC, ECDSA, ECDH.
   Memory protection unit supporting up to eight memory regions with different access rights and two
    privilege levels “privileged” and “user”. “User” level is more restricted in using TOE resources compared to
    “privileged”
   Memory encryption: all data of memories ROM, RAM and NVM are encrypted. Addresses are scrambled to
    disguise the location of data
   Robust set of sensors and detectors for the purpose of monitoring proper chip operating conditions
    consisting of a temperature sensor, backside light detector, glitch sensor and low frequency sensor.
   Redundant alarm propagation and system deactivation principle, which decreases the risk of manipulation
    and tampering.
   Register protection: protection of security relevant registers against fault attacks using OCC.
   Security life control: a life test on specific security features can be used by the IC embedded software to
    detect manipulation of these security features
   Program flow integrity protection: The Instruction Stream Signature Checking (ISS) can be employed by the
    IC embedded software to detect illegal program flows and trigger an alarm. The TOE also contains a
    watchdog, which may be used to detect program flow manipulations.
   Peripheral access control: The TOE allows the IC embedded software to lock certain peripherals
    dynamically.
   Bus encryption for security peripherals: All data transfers to and from dedicated peripherals are encrypted
    dynamically.
   Tearing safe NVM programming: the HSL provides specific routines provided for tearing safe programming.
    These routines prevent an unspecified interim state by either propagating the pre- or post-programming
    condition.
   Security optimized wiring: shield lines in combination with layout measures reduce the risk of successful
    manipulative attacks.
   Leakage control of data dependant code execution: dedicated measures allow the user to reduce such
    leakage.
   Device phase management supporting isolation of test features and Flash Loader accessibility: dedicated
    test features employed during production are switched off before customer delivery. The Flash Loader
    usage to download flash data requires either a mutual authentication or a one way user authentication
    depending on the order option EA. The Flash Loader supports permanent deactivation.

  Detection of NVM single and multi bit errors: Single bit errors are detected and corrected and multi bit errors
   detected.
Features, which are not mentioned here do not directly contribute to the SFRs.

1.4.4              Interfaces of the TOE
   The physical interface of the TOE to the external environment is the entire surface of the IC.
   The electrical interface of the TOE to the external environment is constituted by the pads of the chip:
             o The five ISO 7816 pads consist particularly of the contacted RES, I/O, CLK lines and supply lines
                 VCC and GND. The contact based communication is according to ISO 7816/ETSI/EMV.
             o The I2C communication can be driven via the ISO 7816 pads. In this case no other
                 communication using the ISO 7816 pads is possible.
   The RF interface (radio frequency power and signal interface) enables contactless communication between
    a PICC (proximity integration chip card) and a PCD reader/writer (proximity coupling device). Power supply
    is received and data are received or transmitted by an antenna which consists of a coil with a few turns
    directly connected to the IC.
   The data-oriented I/O interface of the TOE is represented by the I/O pad.
   The interface between firmware and hardware consists of special registers used for hardware configuration
    and control (Special Function Registers, SFR).
   Optional: The interface of the TOE to the operating system is covered by the optional HSL routines and by
    the instruction set of the TOE.
   Optional: The interface of the NRGҹ SW defined by the NRGҹ SW
   The interface of the UMSLC lib defined by the UMSLC lib
   Optional: The interface to the SCL calculations is defined by the SCL
   Optional: The interface to the ACL calculations is defined by the ACL

1.4.5              Forms of Delivery
The TOE can be delivered in the form of complete modules, as plain wafers in an IC case (e.g. DSO20) or in bare
dies. The delivery can therefore be at the end of phase 3 or at the end of phase 4 which may also include pre-
personalization steps according to [PP0084]. This means phase 4 is also part of the evaluation process. In any
case the testing of the TOE is finished and the extended test features are removed. From a security policy point
of view the different forms of delivery do not have any impact.
The delivery to the software developer (phase 2  phase 1) contains the documents as described above.
Part of the software delivery is the Flash Loader program, provided by Infineon Technologies AG, running on
the TOE and controlling the download of user software onto the TOE via the UART or RF interface. The
download is only possible after successful authentication. The user software and data must be encrypted
before download. In addition, the user can permanently block further use of the Flash Loader.
The table as follows provides an overview about form and method of TOE deliveries:

Conformance Claims (ASE_CCL)


2                        Conformance Claims (ASE_CCL)
2.1                      Conformance Claims (ASE CCL)
This ST and TOE claim conformance to CC v3.1 revision 5. The ST claims conformance to [CCBook3]. It is
[CCBook2] extended.

2.1.1                    PP Claim
This ST is strictly conformant to [PP0084]. The assurance level is EAL6+. The augmentation is achieved - with
regard to [CCBook3]: Security assurance components by including:

Table 5          Augmentations of the assurance level of the TOE
    Assurance Class                              Assurance Family                             Description
    Life-cycle support                           ALC_FLR.1                                    Basic flaw remediation

The Security IC Platform Protection Profile with Augmentation Packages is registered and certified by the
Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik1 (BSI) under the reference [PP0084].
The security assurance requirements of the TOE are according to [PP0084 and [CCBook3].

2.1.2                    Package Claim
This ST claims conformance to the following additional packages taken from [PP0084]:
 Package Authentication of the Security IC, section 7.2, conformant.
      This package is only claimed in case TOE is ordered with configuration option EA unavailable.
     Package Loader, Package 1: Loader dedicated for usage in secured environment only, section 7.3.1,
      conformant
      This package is optional and fulfilled only by TOE products with Flash Loader.
     Package Loader, Package 2: Loader dedicated for usage by authorized users only,
      section 7.3.2, augmented
      This package is optional and fulfilled only by TOE products with Flash Loader and configuration option EA
      unavailable.
     Package TDES ; section 7.4.1, augmented
     Package AES ; section 7.4.2, augmented

Conformance Claims (ASE_CCL)

 the IC Dedicated Test Software,
 the IC Dedicated Support Software.

The TOE is designed, produced and/or generated by the TOE Manufacturer.
The security problem definition of [PP0084] is enhanced by adding additional threats and an environmental
objective. Including these add-ons, the security problem definition of this ST is consistent with the statement of
the security problem definition in [PP0084], as the ST claims strict conformance to [PP0084].
The threat memory access violation T.Mem-Access has been added, due to specific TOE memory access control
functionality. This add-on has no impact on the conformance statements regarding [CCbook1] and [PP0084]
with following rational:
   The security target remains conformant to [CCbook1], claim 576 as the possibility to introduce additional
    restrictions is given.
 The security target fulfils the strict conformance claim of [PP0084] due to the application notes 5, 6 and 7
    which apply here. By those notes the addition of further security functions and security services are
    covered, even without deriving particular security functionality from a threat but from a policy.
The threat T.Open_Samples_Diffusion is added in case physical protection during TOE delivery to customers is
omitted. This threat increases the scope of threats and does not contradict to any of the defined threats of
[PP0084].
The environmental objective OE.Prevent_Masquerade is added to require the environment to add additional
measures in case EA is available in order to prevent masquerading attacks. The strict conformance to [PP0084]
is still met, because the ability of the TOE to prevent masquerading attacks is met by an optional package , i.e.
“Package Authentication of the Security IC”. In case this package is not claimed, the TOE does not provide
sufficient measures to prevent masquerading. Requesting the environment to fill this gap is an important
requirement, if masquerading attacks are considered relevant. [PP0084] does not add any considerations in
case the TOE does not claim this package.

Security Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)


3                  Security Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)
The content of [PP0084] applies to this chapter completely.

3.1                Threats
The threats are directed against the assets and/or the security functions of the TOE. For example, certain
attacks are only one step towards a disclosure of assets while others may directly lead to a compromise of the
application security. The more detailed description of specific attacks is given later on in the process of
evaluation and certification. An overview on attacks is given in [PP0084] section 3.2.
The threats to security are defined and described in [PP0084] sections 3.2 and 7.2.1.

Table 6       Threats according to [PP0084]
 T.Phys-Manipulation         Physical Manipulation
 T.Phys-Probing              Physical Probing
 T.Malfunction               Malfunction due to Environmental Stress
 T.Leak-Inherent             Inherent Information Leakage
 T.Leak-Forced               Forced Information Leakage
 T.Abuse-Func                Abuse of Functionality
 T.RND                       Deficiency of Random Numbers
 T.Masquerade_TOE            Masquerade the TOE

3.1.1              Additional Threat due to TOE specific Functionality
The additional functionality of introducing sophisticated privilege levels and access control allows the secure
separation between the operation system(s) and applications, the secure downloading of applications after
personalization and enables multitasking by separating memory areas and performing access controls
between different applications. Due to this additional functionality “area based memory access control” a new
threat is introduced.
The TOE shall avert the threat “Memory Access Violation (T.Mem-Access)” as specified below:
T.Mem-Access           Memory Access Violation
                       Parts of the Smartcard Embedded Software may cause security violations by
                       accidentally or deliberately accessing restricted data (which may include code) or
                       privilege levels. Any restrictions are defined by the security policy of the specific
                       application context and must be implemented by the Smartcard Embedded Software.
“Diffusion of open samples” threat:
T.Open_Samples_Diffusion Diffusion of Open Samples
                       An attacker may get access to open samples of the TOE and use them to gain
                       information about the TSF (loader, memory management unit, ROM code …). He may
                       also use the open samples to characterize the behavior of the IC and its security
                       functionalities (for example: characterization of side channel profiles, perturbation
                       cartography …). The execution of a dedicated security features (for example: execution
                       of a DES computation without countermeasures or by de-activating countermeasures)

 available)                    fulfilling the access conditions required by the Loader.



4.3                Security Objectives Rationale
The security objectives rationale of the TOE is defined and described in [PP0084] section 4.4, 7.3.1, 7.3.2, 7.4.1
and section 7.4.2.
Compared to [PP0084] an enhancement regarding memory area protection has been established. The clear
definition of privilege levels for operated software establishes the clear separation of different restricted
memory areas for running the firmware, downloading and/or running the operating system and to establish a
clear separation between different applications. Nevertheless, it is also possible to define a shared memory
section where separated applications may exchange defined data. The privilege levels clearly define by using a
hierarchical model the access right from one level to the other. These measures ensure that the threat T.Mem-
Access is clearly covered by the security objective O.Mem-Access.
The objectives O.Authentication, O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader and the organizational policiy P.Ctrl_Loader and the
environmental objective OE.TOE_Auth as described in [PP0084] chapter 7.2 and 7.3.2 apply only to TOE
products with Flash Loader enabled for software or data download by the user. In other cases the Flash Loader
is not available anymore and the user software or data download is completed. If TOE is ordered with
configuration option EA available the objectives O.Authentication and the environmental objective
OE.TOE_Auth are not applicable for the TOE. In this case, the TOE implements a one-way authentication of
users instead of a mutual authentication.
The objective OE.Prevent_Masquerade requires measures by customers to ensure the authenticity of the TOE.
Due to the combination of these measures with the one-way authentication enforced by the Flash Loader with
EA, both communication end points are considered to be authentic. Therefore, O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader is still
applicable while the objective OE.Loader_Usage is replaced by the objective OE.Prevent_Masquerade.
The objectives O.RSA, O.ECC, O.AES-TDES-MAC cover the policy P.Crypto_Services. This policy intends to allow
adding various cryptographic services to the TSF.

Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)

The objective O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality counters the threat T.Open_Samples_Diffusion. In addition
T.Open_Samples_Diffusion is countered by O.Leak-Inherent and O.Leak-Forced.
The environmental objective OE. Prevent_Masquerade is introduced because the availability of package
“Authentication of the Security IC” depends on specific order options. In case the chosen order options exclude
this package, the user has to provide measures to neutralize the threat T.Masquerade_TOE.

Extended Component Definition (ASE_ECD)


5                  Extended Component Definition (ASE_ECD)
There are several extended components defined and described for the TOE:
   the family FCS_RNG at the class FCS Cryptographic Support
   the family FMT_LIM at the class FMT Security Management
   the family FAU_SAS at the class FAU Security Audit
   the family FDP_SDC at the class FDP User Data Protection
   the family FIA_API at the class FIA Identification and Authentication
   the component FPT_TST.2 at the class FPT Protection of the TSF
The extended families FCS_RNG, FMT_LIM, FAU_SAS, FDP_SDC and FIA_API are defined and described in
[PP0084] section 5. The component FPT_TST.2 is defined in the following sections.

5.1                Component “Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)”
The security is strongly dependent on the correct operation of the security functions. Therefore, the TOE shall
support that particular security functions or mechanisms are tested in the operational phase (Phase 7). The
tests can be initiated by the Smartcard Embedded Software and/or by the TOE or is done automatically and
continuously.
Part 2 of the Common Criteria provides the security functional component “TSF testing (FPT_TST.1)”. The
component FPT_TST.1 provides the ability to test the TSF’s correct operation.
For the user it is important to know which security functions or mechanisms can be tested. The functional
component FPT_TST.1 does not mandate to explicitly specify the security functions being tested. In addition,
FPT_TST.1 requires verification of the integrity of TSF data and of the stored TSF executable code which might
violate the security policy. Therefore, the functional component ”Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)”
of the family TSF self test has been newly created. This component allows that particular parts of the security
mechanisms and functions provided by the TOE are tested.

5.2                Definition of FPT_TST.2
The functional component “Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)” has been newly created (Common
Criteria Part 2 extended). This component allows that particular parts of the security mechanisms and
functions provided by the TOE can be tested after TOE Delivery or are tested automatically and continuously
during normal operation transparent for the user.
This security functional component is used instead of the functional component FPT_TST.1 from Common
Criteria Part 2. For the user it is important to know which security functions or mechanisms can be tested. The
functional component FPT_TST.1 does not mandate to explicitly specify the security functions being tested. In
addition, FPT_TST.1 requires verifying the integrity of TSF data and stored TSF executable code which might
violate the security policy.
The functional component “Subset TOE testing (FPT_TST.2)” is specified as follows (Common Criteria Part 2
extended).

                   request of the authorized user, or when other conditions are met. It also provides the ability to
                   verify the integrity of TSF data and executable code.
Management: FPT_TST.2
The following actions could be considered for the management functions in FMT:
 management of the conditions under which subset TSF self testing occurs, such as during initial start-up,
  regular interval or under specified conditions
 management of the time of the interval appropriate.

Audit: FPT_TST.2

According to [PP0084] Application Note 14 the term “secure state” used by FPT_FLS.1 shall be described and a
definition should be provided.
Definition of secure state:
Secure state describes three different conditions of the TOE:
1. the controller ceases operation. This condition can only be resolved by a cold or warm start of the
   controller. It is triggered by a security reset.
2. the controller enters a security trap. The trap handler can be defined by the user. In case no trap handler is
   provided the first condition is entered.
3. in case of a sudden power loss of the TOE during NVM programming (tearing): the TOE is in a condition to
   either restore the old NVM content or to start with the new programmed value. This condition of security
   state is only provided in case the HSL is part of the TOE and one of the tearing-safe functions of the HSL is
   used.

Note:         a security reset invalidates the RAM content.

Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)

According to [PP0084] Application Note 15, “The Common Criteria suggest that the TOE generates audit data
for the security functional requirements Limited fault tolerance (FRU_FLT.2) and Failure with preservation of
secure state (FPT_FLS.1).” In case of the first two conditions no Audit data are collected, because the effect
entering the secure state is immediately visible. For the third condition indirect audit data is available, i.e. the
user can check, whether new or old NVM data is available.

6.1.2                  Extended Components
An additional family (FCS_RNG) of the Class FCS (cryptographic support) is defined in [PP0084]. This family
describes the functional requirements for random number generation used for cryptographic purposes.
The functional requirements FCS_RNG.1/TRNG, FCS_RNG.1/HPRG, FCS_RNG.1/DRNG, FCS_RNG.1/DRNG4 are
iterations of the FCS_RNG.1 defined in [PP0084] refined in [BSI_RNGs].

Note:          The internal random numbers produced by the employed PTG.2-conform PTRNG are adaptively
               compressed raw bits, where the compression rate is controlled by a so-called entropy estimator. The
               concept ensures that the random numbers provided by the PTRNG have high entropy, i.e., each
               delivered random byte will have more the 7.976 bit of entropy. In addition, the PTRNG produced
               random numbers have been tested against test procedures A and B under varying environment

6.1.5                  Memory access control
Usage of multiple applications in one Smartcard often requires code and data separation in order to prevent
that one application can access code and/or data of another application. For this reason the TOE provides Area
based Memory Access Control. The underlying Memory Protection Unit (MPU) is documented in Appendix B3.5
of the ARMv7 M architecture reference manual [ARMv7M].
In particular, the MPU provides full support for:
 Protection regions.
 Overlapping protection regions, with ascending region priority:
  − Region 7 = highest priority.
  − Region 0 = lowest priority.
 Access permissions.
   MPU mismatches and permission violations invoke the programmable-priority MemManage fault handler.

The MPU can be used to:
   Enforce privilege rules, preventing user applications from corrupting operating system data.
   Separate processes, blocking the active task from accessing other tasks’ data.
   Enforce access rules, allowing memory regions to be defined as read-only or detecting unexpected memory
    accesses.

The SFRs are provided by the Memory Access Control Policy (FDP_ACC.1 and dependencies).


6.1.5.1                Subjects, objects and operations of the Memory Access Control Policy
Subjects:
 MPU

Objects:
 memory/code addresses

Operations:
 Read a/o write a/o execute access


6.1.5.2                Security attributes of the Memory Access Control Policy
Security Attribute which define the roles for Subject MPU:
 Npriv flag defining privilege/non-privilege mode


Security Attribute which control the behavior of the Subject MPU:

Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)

 MPU enable/disable bit.
 8 regions with the following attributes
    − a unique priority
    − the enable bit
    − the xn (execute never) bit
    − the start address and size
    − an access matrix which defines if an Operation of the MPU (Subject) to a memory/code address (Object)
     lying in the region is allowed or denied
 A bit defining the acces behavior of the default region, i.e. memory/code addresses not covered by one of the
  8 MPU regions.


Security Attributes for objects:
There are no security attributes for objects.


6.1.5.3            Access control rules of the Memory Access Control Policy
The following generic rules shall apply in case the MPU is enabled. In case the MPU is disabled, a privileged and
unprivileged code has full read/write/execute rights to all addresses.
 If an address is contained in multiple enabled regions, then the region with the highest priority defines the
    access rights.
   If an address is contained in no region then the default region defines the access rights.
   The region defining the access rights checks if the Subject has access to the Object with respect to the desired
    Operation. In case the access is denied the MPU throws an access violation exception. The checks are done
    according to the access matrix inTable 21.
   overlapping regions, have access to other regions with ascending region priority:
    region 7 = highest priority, region 0 = lowest priority
   execution of code is bound to the read access of Table 21 and the xn bit. If the xn bit is cleared and read
    access is enabled then execution of code is defined by Table 21. If the xn bit is set then execution is never
    allowed.

1.3 TOE Overview
The Security Target (ST) defines the security objectives and requirements for a
contact or contactless based chip of machine readable travel documents (MRTD)
based on the requirements and recommendations of the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO), EU requirements for biometric European passport
(Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 and Commission Implementing Decision
6181) and Biometric European Resident Permit (REGULATION (EU) 2017/1954
and Commission Implementing Decision 6178). This product is intended to
enable verification of the authenticity of the travel document and to identify its
holder during a border control, using an inspection system. The verification
process is based on Extended Access Control with Password Authenticated
Connection Establishment (PACE) and optionally Active Authentication (AA).

The main features and their origin are the following:
 Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
   according to ICAO Technical Report “Supplemental Access Control” [ICAO-
   9303] part 11 and strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0068-V2 [PACE-PP] for
   protection of the communication between terminal and chip. The following
   PACE mapping modes are supported and covered by the TOE:
      o    Generic Mapping (PACE-GM)
      o    Integrated Mapping (PACE-IM)
      o    Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM), which combines PACE-GM
           with Chip Authentication into a single protocol.

   Chip Authentication v1
    according to BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1], [TR-03110-3] and
    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    travel document’s chip to the inspection system.
   Terminal Authentication v1
    according to BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1], [TR-03110-3] and
    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    inspection system to travel document’s chip and protects the confidentiality
    and integrity of the sensitive biometric reference data during their
    transmission from the TOE to the inspection system.

As a feature that can be optionally configured the TOE supports:
   Active Authentication
    which according to [ICAO-9303] prevents copying the SOD and proves that it
    has been read from the authentic chip. It proves that the chip has not been
    substituted.


   Polymorphic Authentication
    which according to [PCA-eMRTD] provides additional privacy by randomisation
    of returned Polymorphic Identities, Polymorphic Pseudonyms and
    Complementary Polymorphic ID attributes in combination with standard ICAO
    and EAC1 eMRTD protocols specified in ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] and BSI
    TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1] and [TR 03110-3].

The TOE may also be used as an ISO driving license, compliant to ISO/IEC 18013
or ISO/IEC TR 19446 supporting PACE, AA and CA, as both applications (MRTD
and IDL) share the same protocols and data structure organization. Therefore, in
the rest of the document, the word “MRTD” MAY be understood either as a MRTD
in the sense of ICAO, or a driving license compliant to ISO/IEC 18013 or ISO/IEC
TR 19446 depending on the targeted usage envisioned by the issuer.

Application note
This TOE claims an assurance level EAL5 augmented with AVA_VAN.5 and
ALC_DVS.2. AVA_VAN.5 implies that the TOE is resistant to attacks performed by
an attacker possessing "High attack potential".
Not all key sizes specified in this security target have sufficient cryptographic
strength for satisfying the AVA_VAN.5 “high attack potential”. In order to be
protected against attackers with a "high attack potential", sufficiently large
cryptographic key sizes SHALL be configured for this TOE. References can be
found in national and international document standards. Further details have
been specified in the TOE’s guidance documentation [AGD_PRE].

[TR-03110] have also been refered to in ISO18013 for EU driving licences. The
BAP-1 protocol defined in ISO18013 is equal to Basic Access Protocol (BAC)
defined in [ICAO-9303]. As to the logical data structure, the ISO18013 uses the
same concept of Passive Authentication defined in [ICAO-9303], but specifies
different ISO7816-4 elementary file identifiers for storing the ICAO defined
content of DG3, DG4 and DG15.

When an Issuing state is using the product as an ISO compliant Driving licence,
the following name mapping of roles, definitions, data groups and protocol is

1.4.2.1 ICAO/EAC eMRTD and ISO Driving licence
This sub section explains the TOE security features for operational use of TOE
configured as ICAO/EAC eMRTD or as Driving Licence.

A State or Organisation issues travel documents to be used by the holder for
international travel. The traveller presents a travel document to the inspection
system to prove his or her identity. The travel document in context of this
Security Target contains:
  I.  visual (eye readable) biographical data and portrait of the holder,
 II.  a separate data summary (MRZ data) for visual and machine reading using
       OCR methods in the Machine readable zone (MRZ) and
III.  data elements on the travel document’s chip according to LDS in case of
       contactless machine reading.

The authentication of the traveller is based on:
  I.  the possession of a valid travel document personalized for a holder with
      the claimed identity as given on the biographical data page and
 II.  biometrics using the reference data stored in the travel document.

The issuing State or Organization ensures the authenticity of the data of genuine
travel documents. The receiving State trusts a genuine travel document of an
issuing State or Organization.

For this Security Target the travel document is viewed as unit of:
(i) the physical part of the travel document in form of paper and/or plastic
    and chip. It presents visual readable data including (but not limited to)
    personal data of the travel document holder
    (a) the biographical data on the biographical data page of the travel
         document surface,
    (b) the printed data in the Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) and
    (c) the printed portrait.

(ii) the logical travel document as data of the travel document holder stored
     according to the Logical Data Structure as defined in [ICAO-9303] as specified
     by ICAO on the contact based or contactless integrated circuit. It presents
     contact based / contactless readable data including(but not limited to)
     personal data of the travel document holder
     (a) the digital Machine Readable Zone Data (digital MRZ data, EF.DG1),
     (b) the digitized portraits (EF.DG2),
     (c) the biometric reference data of finger(s) (EF.DG3) or iris image(s)
          (EF.DG4) or both1,
     (d) the other data according to LDS (EF.DG5 to EF.DG16) and
     (e) the Document Security Object (SOD).


The issuing State or Organisation implements security features of the travel
document to maintain the authenticity and integrity of the travel document and
their data. The physical part of the travel document and the travel document’s
chip are identified by the Document Number.

The physical part of the travel document is protected by physical security
measures (e.g. watermark, security printing), logical (e.g. authentication keys of
the travel document’s chip) and organisational security measures (e.g. control of
materials, personalisation procedures) [ICAO-9303].These security measures can
include the binding of the travel document’s chip to the travel document.

The logical travel document is protected in authenticity and integrity by a digital
signature created by the document signer acting for the issuing State or
Organisation and the security features of the travel document’s chip.

The ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] defines the baseline security methods Passive
Authentication, advanced security access methods Basic Access Control (BAC)
and Password Authenticated Connection Establishment to the logical travel



These biometric reference data are optional according to [ICAO-9303]. This ST assumes that the issuing State or

document, Active Authentication of the travel document’s chip, Extended Access
Control and the Data Encryption of sensitive biometrics as optional security
measure. The Passive Authentication Mechanism is performed completely and
independently of the TOE by the TOE environment.

The BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1] and [TR 03110-3] specify the
Extended Access Control protocols Chip Authentication version 1 (CAv1) and
Terminal Authentication (TAv1), which are required to get secured access to the
biometric data stored in data groups DG3 and DG4 in combination with PACE or
BAC.

This Security Target addresses the protection of the logical travel document:
   (i) in integrity by write-only-once access control and by physical means, and
   (ii) in confidentiality by the Extended Access Control Mechanism.

This Security Target addresses the Chip Authentication Version 1 described in
[TR-03110-1] and PACE-CAM described in [ICAO-9303] part 11 as an alternative
to the Active Authentication stated in [ICAO-9303].

For Basic Access Control (BAC) supported by the product, a separate evaluation
and certification is performed with ST [ST-BAC].

The confidentiality by Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
is a mandatory security feature of the TOE. The travel document shall strictly
conform to the ‘Common Criteria Protection Profile Machine Readable Travel
Document using Standard Inspection Procedure with PACE [PACE-PP]. Note that
[PACE-PP] considers high attack potential.

For the PACE protocol according to [ICAO-9303] part 11, the following steps shall
be performed:
 (i) the travel document's chip encrypts a nonce with the shared password,
       derived from the MRZ resp. CAN data and transmits the encrypted nonce
       together with the domain parameters to the terminal.
 (ii) The terminal recovers the nonce using the shared password, by
       (physically) reading the MRZ or CAN data. This nonce shall be converted to
       a group generator using one of the following mapping algorithms, which
       maps a static generator to an ephemeral generator:
           a. Generic mapping (PACE-GM) or
           b. Integrated mapping PACE-IM)
 (iii) The travel document's chip and terminal computer perform a Diffie-
       Hellmann key agreement together with the ephemeral domain parameters
       to create a shared secret. Both parties derive the session keys KMAC and
       KENC from the shared secret.
 (iv) Each party generates an authentication token, sends it to the other party
       and verifies the received token.

In case of PACE with Chip Authenticated Mapping (PACE-CAM), in addition to the
steps above executed for the PACE-GM variant, the MRTD chip computes Chip
Authentication Data CAIC, encrypts them AIC = E(KSEnc, CAIC) and sends them

to the terminal. The terminal decrypts AIC and verifies the authenticity of the
chip using the recovered Chip Authentication Data CAIC.

After successful key negotiation, the terminal and the travel document's chip
provide private communication (secure messaging) [TR-03110-1], [ICAO-9303].

This Security Target requires the TOE to implement the Extended Access Control
as defined in [TR-03110-1]. The Extended Access Control consists of two parts:
  (i) the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1 and
  (ii) the Terminal Authentication Protocol Version 1 (v.1).

The Chip Authentication Protocol v.1
  (i) authenticates the travel document’s chip to the inspection system and
  (ii) establishes secure messaging which is used by Terminal Authentication v.1
       to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the sensitive biometric
       reference data during their transmission from the TOE to the inspection
       system. Therefore Terminal Authentication v.1 can only be performed if
       Chip Authentication v.1has been successfully executed.

The Terminal Authentication Protocolv.1 consists of
  (i) the authentication of the inspection system as entity authorized by the
       receiving State or Organisation through the issuing State, and
  (ii) an access control by the TOE to allow reading the sensitive biometric
       reference data only to successfully authenticated authorized inspection
       systems.

The Active Authentication protocol may be optionally configured during
personalisation.

The issuing State or Organisation authorizes the receiving State by means of
certification the authentication public keys of Document Verifiers who create
Inspection System Certificates.


1.4.2.2 Polymorphic eMRTD

In addition to an ICAO/EAC eMRTD functionality, the TOE supports Polymorphic
eMRTD extensions that can be configured using the same applet during
personalisation. The TOE’s Polymorphic eMRTD extensions enable secure
authentication with enhanced privacy protection features. The Polymorphic
extensions provide the holder the possibility to authenticate towards a service
provider using an authentication service in a non-traceable and non-linkable
manner thanks to usage of Polymorphic ID attributes.

The Polymorphic extensions are used to configure a Polymorphic eMRTD as stand
alone application instance or next to an ICAO/EAC eMRTD/Driving application
licence instance having its own application identifier during personalisation.

                        eMRTD Configuration)

The Polymorphic eMRTD uses the same ICAO and EAC1 protocols like PACEv2,
Chip Authentication v1 (CAv1) and Terminal Authentication (v1) as defined in
[ICAO-9303], [TR-03110-1] and [TR-03110-3]. The TOE’s Polymorphic eMRTD
extensions provide the following features:

      Secure storage of the Polymorphic ID attributes during personalisation or
       the TOE.
      Polymorphic Authentication Protocol (PMA) for authenticated access with
       user consent, randomization and secure readout of the Polymorphic ID
       attributes, in combination with PACEv2 and EAC1 eMRTD protocols.
      PACEv2 protocol extended with PIN and PUK passwords, to enforce user
       authentication (document holder verification) in compliance with [TR-
       03101-3].

For Polymorphic eMRTD, the PACE protocol is configured with PIN, PUK and CAN
passwords in compliance with [TR-03110-3] during personalisation. Only PACE-
GM and PACE-IM are configurable for a Polymorphic eMRTD.

The Active Authentication protocol shall not be configured for a polymorphic
eMRTD.

The logical data structure consists only of EF.CVCA, DG14 and EF.SOD. In order
to assure a sufficient level of privacy during authentication the CAv1 private key
and EF.SOD are shared amoung a sufficient high number of personalised
Polymorphic eMRTDs, i.e. the logical data structure does not contain any unique
identifiable data.



1.4.3 TOE life cycle
The TOE life cycle is described in terms of its four life cycle phases. (With respect
to the [SIC-PP], the TOE life-cycle is additionally subdivided into 7 steps in the
ST. These steps are denoted too in the following although the sequence of the
steps differs for the TOE life cycle).

1.4.3.1 Phase 1 “Development”
(Step1) The TOE is developed in phase 1. The IC developer develops the
integrated circuit, the IC Dedicated Software and the guidance documentation
associated with these TOE components.
The IC developer also acts as the developer of the embedded software (operating
system), which is the NXP JCOP 3 P60.

(Step2) The software developer uses the guidance documentation for the
integrated circuit and the guidance documentation for relevant parts of the NXP
JCOP 3 P60 and develops the ePassport application and the guidance
documentation associated with this TOE component.

The ePassport application (i.e. the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
(SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet run time code) may be
integrated either in ROM or in EEPROM of the chip. Depending on the intention:
      (a) the ePassport application is securely delivered directly from the
          software developer (IDEMIA development dept.) to the IC manufacturer
          (NXP). The applet code will be integrated into the ROM mask code or
          inEEPROM by the IC manufacturer, or
      (b) the ePassport application is securely delivered directly from the
          software developer (IDEMIA development dept.) to the travel document
          manufacturer (IDEMIA production dept.) .) for loading in EEPROM.

Notice that the guidance documentation of the ePassport application is always
securely delivered directly from the software developer (IDEMIA development
dept.) to the travel document manufacturer (IDEMIA production dept.).


1.4.3.2 Phase 2 “Manufacturing”
(Step3) In a first step the TOE integrated circuit is produced containing the travel
document’s chip Dedicated Software, the parts of the travel document’s chip
Embedded Software and in case of alternative a) the ePassport application in
ROM or in EEPROM.

The IC manufacturer writes the IC Identification Data onto the chip to control the
IC as travel document material during the IC manufacturing and the delivery
process to the travel document manufacturer. The IC is securely delivered from
the IC manufacturer to the travel document manufacturer.

If necessary the IC manufacturer adds the parts of the IC Embedded Software in
the non-volatile programmable memories (for instance EEPROM).

(Step4 optional) The travel document manufacturer combines the IC with
hardware for the contact based / contactless interface in the travel document
unless the travel document consist of the chip only.

(Step5) The travel document manufacturer
  i.  adds the IC Embedded Software or part of it in the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM) if necessary and in case
      of alternative (b), loads the ePassport application into the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM),
 ii.      creates the ePassport application and
iii.      equips travel document’s chips with pre-personalization Data.

Both the underlying platform and IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
(SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet provide configuration and
life-cycle management functions required for TOE preparation. TOE preparation
steps are performed in manufacturing phase and consist of the following 2
activities:
    1. Platform initialisation
       2. Pre-personalisation

Platform initialisation
Platform initialisation consists of the configuration of the NXP JCOP 3 P60 in
accordance with requirements specified in the platform administrator guidance
[PLTF-PRE] by using the dedicated platform commands. Furthermore the Pre-
Personalisation Agent key set is installed and (a part of) the CPLC data is
updated. To prevent unattended tracing of the MRTD document, the NXP JCOP 3
P60 is configured such that unauthenticated access to any platform unique
idenfiable data is not possible.

                              eMRTD Configuration)

Pre-personalisation
The pre-personalisation consists of the following steps:
   a. IC (chip) Authentication and getting chip access with the pre-
      personalisation key set.
   b. [optional] In case the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
      (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet runtime code does
      not reside in ROM, it is loaded into EEPROM.
   c. Install the applet application instances depending on the desired TOE
      configuration specified in section 1.4.2, using IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with
      Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet.
   d. Set the ePassport (and if present) the Polymorphic eMRTD applet
      irreversibly in its PERSONALISATION life-cycle state by installation of the
      Personalisation Agent specific personalisation key set(s).

During step (c) the CPLC data with the IC Identifier as well as the other pre-
personalisation data is configured in the TOE. The last step (d) finalizes the TOE.
This is the moment the TOE starts to exist and is ready for delivery to the
Personalisation Agent. The guidance documentation for the Personalisation Agent
is [AGD_PRE].

The pre-personalised travel document together with the IC Identifier is securely
delivered from the travel document manufacturer to the Personalisation Agent.
The travel document manufacturer also provides the relevant parts of the
guidance documentation [AGD_PRE] and [AGD_OPE] and the Personalisation
Agent Key set to the Personalisation Agent. The following table describes the
physical delivery of the TOE components:

1.4.3.3 Phase 3 “Personalisation of the travel document”
(Step 6) The personalisation of the travel document includes
  i.  the survey of the MRTD holder’s biographical data,
 ii.   the enrolment of the MRTD holder biometric reference data (i.e. the
       digitized portraits and the optional biometric reference data),
iii.   the printing of the visual readable data onto the physical MRTD,
iv.    the writing of the TOE User Data and TSF Data into the logical MRTD and
 v.    configuration of the TSF if necessary.

The step (iv) is performed by the Personalisation Agent and includes but is not
limited to the creation of:
  i.   the digital MRZ data (EF.DG1),
 ii.   the digitized portrait (EF.DG2), and
iii.   the Document security object.

The signing of the Document security object by the Document signer [ICAO-
9303] finalizes the personalisation of the genuine travel document for the travel
document holder. The personalised travel document (together with appropriate
guidance (AGD_OPE) for TOE usage if necessary) is handed over to the travel
document holder for operational use.

The personalisation of Polymorphic eMRTD application instance includes:

 i.    establishing the identity of the polymorphic eMRTD document holder,
 ii.   Requesting the required Polymorphic eMRTD ID attributes from the central
       Key Management authority,
iii.   writing Polymorphic ID attributes, Polymorphic LDS data as defined in
       [PCA-eMRTD],
iv.    writing the TSF data (PIN, PUK, CAv1 private key) as defined in [PCA-
       eMRTD],
 v.    signing the Document Security Object defined in
       [ICAO-9303] (in the role of DS).


The signing of the Document security object by the Document signer [ICAO-
9303] finalizes the personalisation of the genuine Polymorphic eMRTD document
for the travel document holder. The personalised Polymorphic eMRTD document
(together with appropriate guidance (AGD_OPE) for TOE usage if necessary) is
handed over to the Polymorphic eMRTD document holder for operational use.

Authentication trust anchor, the effective date and the Chip Authentication
Private Key.

EAC PP Application note 3: This ST distinguishes between the Personalisation
Agent as entity known to the TOE and the Document Signer as entity in the TOE
IT environment signing the Document security object as described in [ICAO-
9303]. This approach allows but does not enforce the separation of these roles.


1.4.3.4 Phase 4 “Operational Use”
(Step 7) The TOE is used as a travel document's chip by the traveller and the
inspection systems in the “Operational Use” phase. The user data can be read
according to the security policy of the issuing State or Organisation and can be
used according to the security policy of the issuing State but they can never be
modified.

EAC PP Application note 42: The intention of the ST is to consider at least the
phases 1 and parts of phase 2 (i.e. Step1 to Step3) as part of the evaluation and
therefore to define the TOE delivery according to CC after this phase. Since
specific production steps of phase 2 are of minor security relevance (e.g. booklet
manufacturing and antenna integration) these are not part of the CC evaluation
under ALC. Nevertheless the decision about this has to be taken by the
certification body resp. the national body of the issuing State or Organisation. In
this case the national body of the issuing State or Organisation is responsible for
these specific production steps.
Note that the personalisation process and its environment may depend on
specific security needs of an issuing State or Organisation. All production,
generation and installation procedures after TOE delivery up to the “Operational
Use” (phase 4) have to be considered in the product evaluation process under
AGD assurance class. Therefore, the Security Target outlines the split up of
P.Manufact, P.Personalisation and the related security objectives into aspects
relevant before vs. after TOE delivery.


1.4.3.5 Non-TOE hardware/software/firmware required by the TOE
There is no explicit non-TOE hardware, software or firmware required by the TOE
to perform its claimed security features. The TOE is defined to comprise the chip
and the complete operating system and application. Note, the inlay holding the
chip as well as the antenna and the booklet (holding the printed MRZ) are
needed to represent a complete travel document. Nevertheless, these parts are
not inevitable for the secure operation of the TOE.




2
 For this ST all steps of both phase 1 and phase 2 are part of the evaluation and therefore define the TOE
delivery according to the CC evaluation after this phase.

2.3 Package Claim
This ST is conforming to assurance package EAL5 augmented with ALC_DVS.2
and AVA_VAN.5 defined in CC part 3 [CC-3].


2.4 PP Conformance Rationale
This ST claims strict conformance to [EAC-PP-V2]. According to hints in [EAC-PP-
V2] parts of the [PACE-PP] have been included into this ST. A detailed
justification is given in the following.


2.4.1 Main aspects
-   The TOE description (chapter 1.3) is based on the TOE definition and TOE
    usage of [EAC-PP, 1.1]. It was enhanced by product specific details.

-   All definitions of the security problem definition in [EAC-PP, 3] have been
    taken exactly from the protection profile in the same wording.

-   All security objectives have been taken exactly from [EAC-PP, 4] in the same
    wording, except for OT.Chip_Auth_Proof which is enhanced to support
    Active Authentication.

-   The part of extended components definition has been taken originally from
    [EAC-PP, 5].

-   All SFRs for the TOE have been taken originally from the [EAC-PP, 6.1] added
    by according iterations, selections and assignments.

-   The security assurance requirements (SARs) have been taken originally from
    the EAC-PP. The requirements are shifted to those of EAL 5+.


2.4.2 Overview of differences between the PP and the ST

The Active Authentication has been added to the TOE. For that:
- One assumption has been added to cover Active Authentication during
   personalization: A.Pers_Agent_AA
- Two security objectives for the environment have been added:
   OE.Auth_Key_MRTD and OE.AA_MRTD. These additions to the original
   objectives of the PP do not contradict with any other objective nor mitigate a
   threat (or part of a threat) meant to be addressed by security objectives for
   the TOE in the PP.
- Three security functional requirements have been added:
              FCS_COP.1/SIG_GEN
                FIA_API.1/AA
                FMT_MTD.1/AAPK

                                                                  Page: 26/150
                        eMRTD Configuration)

The additional functionality of Password Authenticated Connection Establishment
with Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM) has been added to the TOE. It
possesses the same security requirements as the PACE functionality, which
means that the same security problem definition is applicable for PACE-CAM.


The following additional SFRs have been defined for PACE-CAM:
              FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM
                FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM
                FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM
                FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM
                FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM
                FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ
                FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_WRITE




The additional functionality of the Polymorphic eMRTD extensions has been
added to the TOE with: (i) additional security problem definition; (ii) additional
security objectives; (iii) additional SFRs. Notice that many SFRs are included
from the [EACv2-PP].

  CSCA also issues the self-signed CSCA Certificate (CCSCA) having to be
  distributed by strictly secure diplomatic means, see [ICAO-9303], 5.5.1.

Personalisation Agent
  An organization acting on behalf of the travel document Issuer to personalise
  the travel document for the travel document holder by some or all of the
  following activities:
       (i) establishing the identity of the travel document holder for the
           biographic data in the travel document,
       (ii) enrolling the biometric reference data of the travel document holder,
       (iii) writing a subset of these data on the physical travel document (optical
           personalisation) and storing them in the travel document (electronic
           personalisation) for the travel document holder as defined in [ICAO-
           9303],
       (iv) writing the document details data,
       (v) writing the initial TSF data, (vi) signing the Document Security Object

Attacker
  A threat agent (a person or a process acting on his behalf) trying to
  undermine the security policy defined by the current PP, especially to change
  properties of the assets having to be maintained. The attacker is assumed to
  possess an at most high attack potential. Please note that the attacker might
  ‘capture’ any subject role recognised by the TOE. This external entity is
  commensurate with ‘Attacker’ in [BAC-PP].
  Additionally to this definition, the definition of an attacker is refined as follows:
  A threat agent trying
      (i) to manipulate the logical travel document without authorization,
      (ii) to read sensitive biometric reference data (i.e. EF.DG3, EF.DG4),
      (iii) to forge a genuine travel document, or
      (iv) to trace a travel document.

3.3.2 Additional Threats

T.Read_Sensitive_Data
  Read the sensitive biometric reference data
  Adverse action: An attacker tries to gain the sensitive biometric reference data
  through the communication interface of the travel document’s chip.
  The attack T.Read_Sensitive_Data is similar to the threat T.Skimming (cf.
  [PP_BAC]) in respect of the attack path (communication interface) and the
  motivation (to get data stored on the travel document’s chip) but differs from
  those in the asset under the attack (sensitive biometric reference data vs.
  digital MRZ, digitized portrait and other data), the opportunity (i.e. knowing
  the PACE Password) and therefore the possible attack methods. Note, that the
  sensitive biometric reference data are stored only on the travel document’s
  chip as private sensitive personal data whereas the MRZ data and the portrait
  are visually readable on the physical part of the travel document as well.
  Threat agent: having high attack potential, knowing the PACE Password, being
  in possession of a legitimate travel document.
  Asset: confidentiality of logical travel document sensitive user data (i.e.
  biometric reference)

T.Counterfeit
  Counterfeit of travel document chip data
  Adverse action: An attacker with high attack potential produces an
  unauthorized copy or reproduction of a genuine travel document’s chip to be
  used as part of a counterfeit travel document. This violates the authenticity of
  the travel document’s chip used for authentication of a traveler by possession
  of a travel document. The attacker may generate a new data set or extract

P.Pre-Operational_Polymorphic
  Pre-operational handling of the polymorphic eMRTD document
     1) The polymorphic eMRTD document Issuer issues the polymorphic
        eMRTD document and approves it using the terminals and
        authentication services complying with all applicable laws and
        regulations.
     2) The polymorphic eMRTD document Issuer guarantees correctness of the
        PI/PP/CPI data stored in the TOE.
     3) The polymorphic eMRTD document Issuer uses only such TOE's
        technical components (IC) which enable traceability of the polymorphic
        eMRTD documents in their manufacturing and issuing life cycle phases,
        i.e. before they are in the operational phase.
     4) If the polymorphic eMRTD document Issuer authorises a Personalisation
        Agent to personalise the polymorphic eMRTD document for polymorphic
        eMRTD document holders, the polymorphic eMRTD document Issuer has
        to ensure that the Personalisation Agent acts in accordance with the
        polymorphic eMRTD document Issuer's policy.
     5) The Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer shall ensure that the
        PP/PI/CPI data are generated and stored securely in the Polymorphic
        eMRTD document.
     6) The Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer shall establish a public key
        infrastructure for the card verifiable certificates used for Terminal
        Authentication v1. For this aim, the Polymorphic eMRTD document
        issuer shall run a Country Verifying Certification Authority. The PKI shall
        fulfill the requirements and rules of the corresponding certificate policy.
        The Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer shall make the CVCA
        certificate available to the personalization agent or the manufacturer.

3.5 Assumptions
The assumptions describe the security aspects of the environment in which the
TOE will be used or is intended to be used.

3.5.1 Assumptions listed in PP PACE

A.Passive_Auth
  PKI for Passive Authentication The issuing and receiving States or
  Organisations establish a public key infrastructure for passive authentication
  i.e. digital signature creation and verification for the logical travel document.
  The issuing State or Organisation runs a Certification Authority (CA) which
  securely generates, stores and uses the Country Signing CA Key pair. The CA
  keeps the Country Signing CA Private Key secret and is recommended to
  distribute the Country Signing CA Public Key to ICAO, all receiving States
  maintaining its integrity. The Document Signer (i) generates the Document
  Signer Key Pair,(ii) hands over the Document Signer Public Key to the CA for
  certification, (iii) keeps the Document Signer Private Key secret and (iv) uses
  securely the Document Signer Private Key for signing the Document Security
  Objects of the travel documents. The CA creates the Document Signer
  Certificates for the Document Signer Public Keys that are distributed to the
  receiving States and Organisations. It is assumed that the Personalisation
  Agent ensures that the Document Security Object contains only the hash
  values of genuine user data according to [ICAO-9303].



3.5.2 Assumptions listed in PP EAC

A.Insp_Sys
  Inspection Systems for global interoperability The Extended Inspection
  System (EIS) for global interoperability includes the Country Signing CA Public
  Key and implements the terminal part of PACE [ICAO-9303] part 11 and/or
  BAC [BAC-PP]. BAC may only be used if supported by the TOE. If both PACE
  and BAC are supported by the TOE and the IS, PACE must be used. The EIS
  reads the logical travel document under PACE or BAC and performs the Chip
  Authentication v.1 to verify the logical travel document and establishes secure
  messaging. EIS supports the Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 in order to
  ensure access control and is authorized by the issuing State or Organisation

                                                                     Ref.:

                                                                 Page: 46/150

  through the Document Verifier of the receiving State to read the sensitive
  biometric reference data.
  Justification: The assumption A.Insp_Sys does not confine the security
  objectives of the [PACE-PP] as it repeats the requirements of P.Terminal and
  adds only assumptions for the Inspection Systems for handling the EAC
  functionality of the TOE.

A.Auth_PKI
  PKI for Inspection Systems The issuing and receiving States or
  Organisations establish a public key infrastructure for card verifiable
  certificates of the Extended Access Control. The Country Verifying Certification
  Authorities, the Document Verifier and Extended Inspection Systems hold
  authentication key pairs and certificates for their public keys encoding the
  access control rights. The Country Verifying Certification Authorities of the
  issuing States or Organisations are signing the certificates of the Document
  Verifier and the Document Verifiers are signing the certificates of the Extended
  Inspection Systems of the receiving States or Organisations. The issuing
  States or Organisations distribute the public keys of their Country Verifying
  Certification Authority to their travel document’s chip.
  Justification: This assumption only concerns the EAC part of the TOE. The
  issuing and use of card verifiable certificates of the Extended Access Control is
  neither relevant for the PACE part of the TOE nor will the security objectives of
  the [PACE-PP] be restricted by this assumption. For the EAC functionality of
  the TOE the assumption is necessary because it covers the pre-requisite for
  performing the Terminal Authentication Protocol Version 1.



3.5.3 Assumptions related to Active Authentication

A.Pers_Agent_AA
     Personalization of the MRTD’s chip (Active Authentication) The
     Personalization Agent ensures the correctness of the Active Authentication
     Public Key (EF.DG15) if stored on the MRTD’s chip.


3.5.4 Assumptions related to Polymorphic eMRTD
The table below provides a mapping giving the Assumptions related to the
polymorphic eMRTD and Assumptions from PACE PP [PACE-PP] and EACv1 PP
[EAC-PP-V2]:

A.Polymorphic_Auth

A.Polymorphic_Auth
  It assumed that:
      o All authentication infrastructure keys used by the central Key
          Management       Authority     for   the    polymorphic    authentication
          infrastructure (generation and transformation of PP, PI and CPI) are
          generated, handled and stored securely.
      o The PP/PI/CPI are generated securely by the central Key Management
          Authority of the polymorphic authentication infrastructure and stored
          securely in the eMRTD polymorphic chip during the personalization
          phase.
      o The TOE communicates only with Trustworthy Authentication
          Service/Terminal during the Polymorphic Authentication.
      o The randomised PP, PI and CPI are securely received by Polymorphic
          Authentication Service/Terminal. The randomised PP, PI and CPI are
          transformed (“re-keyed”) by the central Key Management Authority
          (i.e. ElGamal re-encryption of the randomized PP, PI and/or CPI using
          the public key of Service Provider, who has is authorized to read the
          plain value of identifying user attributes included in the PP, PI or CPI).
          Identification by the identifying user attributes contained inside the PP,
          PI and CPI takes place at the Service Provider.
  Application Note:
  This Assumption has been added to this ST for the polymorphic authentication
  infrastructure. This addition does not conflict with the strict conformance to
  PACE PP [PACE-PP] and EACv1 PP [EAC-PP-V2].

A.Auth_PKI_Polymorphic
  PKI for Polymorphic eMRTD It is assumed that:
     o The issuing States or Organisations establish a dedicated CVCA, DVCA
        and IS PKI for the polymorphic eMRTD infrastructure.
     o The Country Verifying Certification Authorities, the Document Verifier
        and Extended Inspection Systems hold authentication key pairs and
        certificates for their public keys encoding the access control rights for
        access to the PP, PI and (optional) CPI polymorphic user data. The
        Country Verifying Certification Authorities of the issuing States or
        Organisations are signing the certificates of the Document Verifier and
        the Document Verifiers are signing the certificates of the Polymorphic
        Authentication     Terminal/Service   of   the   receiving   States    or
        Organisations. The issuing States or Organisations distribute the public

         keys of their Country Verifying Certification Authority to their
         Polymorphic eMRTD document's chip.
      o The issuing State or Organisation establishs the necessary public key
         infrastructure in order to limit the access to Polymorphic data of
         Polymorphic eMRTD document holders to authorized Organisations. The
         Country Verifying Certification Authority of the issuing State or
         Organisation generates card verifiable Document Verifier Certificates
         for the authorized Document Verifier only.
      o The issuing State or Organisation establishs the necessary public key
         infrastructure in order to (i) generate the Polymorphic eMRTD
         document's Chip Authentication Key Pair, (ii) sign and store the Chip
         Authentication Public Key in the Chip Authentication Public Key data
         and (iii) support Polymorphic Authentication Terminals/Services to
         verify the authenticity of the Polymorphic eMRTD document's chip
         according to [TR-03110] used for genuine Polymorphic eMRTD
         document by certification of the Chip Authentication Public Key by
         means of the Document Security Object.
      o The Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer establishes a public key
         infrastructure for the card verifiable certificates used for Terminal
         Authentication. For this aim, the Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer
         shall run a Country Verifying Certification Authority. The PKI shall fulfill
         the requirements and rules of the corresponding certificate policy. The
         Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer shall make the CVCA certificate
         available to the personalization agent or the manufacturer.
      o The polymorphic eMRTD document Issuer issues the polymorphic
         eMRTD document and approves it using the terminals and
         authentication services complying with all applicable laws and
         regulations.
  Application Note:
  This Assumption is an extension of the Assumption 'A.Auth_PKI' defined in
  [EAC-PP-V2]. For the EAC functionality of the TOE the assumption is necessary
  because it covers the pre-requisite for performing the Terminal Authentication
  Protocol Version 1.

A.Insp_Sys_Polymorphic

Polymorphic Inspection Systems and authentication services
     o Polymorphic    Inspection     Systems   (Polymorphic     Authentication
       Terminals/Services) ensure the confidentiality, Privacy, Authenticity
       and integrity of the polymorphic data read from the polymorphic
       eMRTD document (e.g. PACE PIN/PUK, integrity of PKI certificates,
       randomized PI, PP and optional CPI data, etc.), where it is necessary
       for a secure operation of the TOE.
     o Polymorphic Inspection Systems will prevent eavesdropping to their
       communication with the TOE before secure messaging is successfully
       established based on the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1.

                    eMRTD Configuration)

   o   Polymorphic Inspection Systems examine the polymorphic eMRTD
       document presented by the polymorphic eMRTD document holder to
       verify its authenticity by means of the physical security measures and
       to detect any manipulation of the physical part of the polymorphic
       eMRTD document.
    o Polymorphic Inspection Systems include the Country Signing CA Public
       Key and implement the respective terminal part of the protocols
       required to execute PACE with PIN, Passive Authentication (PA), CAv1,
       TAv1 authentication according to [TR-03110-2] and Polymorphic
       Authentication (PMA). They are assumed to securely store static IS
       private keys and generate secure temporary session keys and nonces.
    o The Document Verifier authorizes Polymorphic Inspection Systems by
       creation of Inspection System Certificates for access to polymorphic
       user data stored the polymorphic eMRTD document. An Polymorphic
       Inspection Systems authenticates itselve to the polymorphic eMRTD
       document's chip for getting access to the polymorphic data with its
       private Terminal Authentication key and corresponding Inspection
       System Certificate.
Application Note:
This Assumption is an extension of the Assumption 'A.Insp_Sys' defined in
[EAC-PP-V2]. For the EAC functionality of the TOE the assumption is necessary
because it covers the pre-requisite for performing the PACE with PIN, CAv1
and TAv1 authentication.

4 Security Objectives

This chapter describes the security objectives for the TOE and the security
objectives for the TOE environment. The security objectives for the TOE
environment are separated into security objectives for the development and
production environment and security objectives for the operational environment.


4.1 Security Objectives for the TOE
This section describes the security objectives for the TOE addressing the aspects
of identified threats to be countered by the TOE and organizational security
policies to be met by the TOE.

4.1.1 Security Objectives listed in PP PACE

OT.Data_Integrity
  Integrity of Data
  The TOE must ensure integrity of the User Data and the TSF-data stored on it
  by protecting these data against unauthorised modification (physical
  manipulation and unauthorised modifying). The TOE must ensure integrity of
  the User Data and the TSF-data during their exchange between the TOE and
  the terminal connected (and represented by PACE authenticated BIS-PACE)
  after the PACE Authentication.

OT.Data_Authenticity
  Authenticity of Data
  The TOE must ensure authenticity of the User Data and the TSF-data stored
  on it by enabling verification of their authenticity at the terminal-side. The TOE
  must ensure authenticity of the User Data and the TSF-data during their
  exchange between the TOE and the terminal connected (and represented by
  PACE authenticated BIS-PACE)after the PACE Authentication. It shall happen
  by enabling such a verification at the terminal-side (at receiving by the
  terminal) and by an active verification by the TOE itself (at receiving by the
  TOE).

OT.Data_Confidentiality
  Confidentiality of Data
  The TOE must ensure confidentiality of the User Data and the TSF-data by
  granting read access only to the PACE authenticated BIS-PACE connected. The
  TOE must ensure confidentiality of the User Data and the TSF-data during
  their exchange between the TOE and the terminal connected (and represented
  by PACE authenticated BIS-PACE) after the PACE Authentication.

                       eMRTD Configuration)

OT.Tracing
  Tracing travel document
  The TOE must prevent gathering TOE tracing data by means of unambiguous
  identifying the travel document remotely through establishing or listening to a
  communication via the contactless/contact interface of the TOE without
  knowledge of the correct values of shared passwords (PACE passwords) in
  advance.

OT.Prot_Abuse-Func
  Protection against Abuse of Functionality
  The TOE must prevent that functions of the TOE, which may not be used in
  TOE operational phase, can be abused in order (i) to manipulate or to disclose
  the User Data stored in the TOE, (ii) to manipulate or to disclose the TSF-data
  stored in the TOE, (iii) to manipulate (bypass, deactivate or modify) soft-
  coded security functionality of the TOE.

OT.Prot_Inf_Leak
  Potection against Information Leakage The TOE must provide protection
  against disclosure of confidential User Data or/and TSF-data stored and/or
  processed by the travel document
      by measurement and analysis of the shape and amplitude of signals or the
        time between events found by measuring signals on the electromagnetic
        field, power consumption, clock, or I/O lines,
      by forcing a malfunction of the TOE and/or
      by a physical manipulation of the TOE.

OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper
  Protection against Physical Tampering
  The TOE must provide protection the confidentiality and integrity of the User
  Data, the TSF Data, and the MRTD’s chip Embedded Software. This includes
  protection against attacks with high attack potential by means of
      measuring through galvanic contacts which is direct physical probing on
        the chips surface except on pads being bonded (using standard tools for
        measuring voltage and current) or
      measuring not using galvanic contacts but other types of physical
        interaction between charges (using tools used in solid-state physics
        research and IC failure analysis)
      manipulation of the hardware and its security features, as well as
      controlled manipulation of memory contents (User Data, TSF Data) with a
        prior
      reverse-engineering to understand the design and its properties and
        functions.

4.2 Security Objectives for the Operational Environment


4.2.1 Issuing State or Organisation
The Issuing State or Organization will implement the following security objectives
of the TOE environment.


OE.Legislative_Compliance
  Issuing of the travel document
  The travel document Issuer must issue the travel document and approve it
  using the terminals complying with all applicable laws and regulations.

OE.Auth_Key_Travel_Document
  Travel document Authentication Key
  The issuing State or Organisation has to establish the necessary public key
  infrastructure in order to (i) generate the travel document’s Chip
  Authentication Key Pair, (ii) sign and store the Chip Authentication Public Key

  inspection systems of receiving States or Organisations to verify the
  authenticity of the travel document’s chip used for genuine travel document by
  certification of the Chip Authentication Public Key by means of the Document
  Security Object.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to counter the Threat
  T.Counterfeit as it specifies the pre-requisite for the Chip Authentication
  Protocol Version 1 which is one of the additional features of the TOE described
  only in [EAC-PP-V2] and not in [PACE-PP].

  Pair, (ii) sign and store the Active Authentication Public Key in the Active
  Authentication Public Key data in EF.DG15 (if generated) and (iii) support
  inspection systems of receiving States or organizations to verify the
  authenticity of the MRTD’s chip used for genuine MRTD by certification of the
  Active Authentication Public Key by means of the Document Security Object.



OE.Authoriz_Sens_Data
  Authorization for Use of Sensitive Biometric Reference Data
  The issuing State or Organisation has to establish the necessary public key
  infrastructure in order to limit the access to sensitive biometric reference data
  of travel document holders to authorized receiving States or Organisations.
  The Country Verifying Certification Authority of the issuing State or
  Organisation generates card verifiable Document Verifier Certificates for the
  authorized Document Verifier only.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Read_Sensitive_Data, the Organisational Security Policy P.Sensitive_Data
  and the Assumption A.Auth_PKI as it specifies the pre-requisite for the
  Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 as it concerns the need of an PKI for this
  protocol and the responsibilities of its root instance. The Terminal
  Authentication Protocol v.1 is one of the additional features of the TOE
  described only in [EAC-PP-V2] and not in [PACE-PP].

      (iii) publish the Certificate of the CSCA Public Key (CCSCA). Hereby
          authenticity and integrity of these certificates are being maintained.
  A Document Signer acting in accordance with the CSCA policy must
      (i) generate a cryptographically secure Document Signing Key Pair,
      (ii) ensure the secrecy of the Document Signer Private Key,
      (iii) hand over the Document Signer Public Key to the CSCA for
          certification,
      (iv) sign Document Security Objects of genuine travel documents in a
          secure operational environment only.
  The digital signature in the Document Security Object relates to all hash
  values for each data group in use according to [ICAO-9303].The
  Personalisation Agent has to ensure that the Document Security Object
  contains only the hash values of genuine user data according to [ICAO-9303].
  The CSCA must issue its certificates exclusively to the rightful organisations
  (DS) and DSs must sign exclusively correct Document Security Objects to be
  stored on travel document.

OE.Personalisation
  Personalisation of travel document
  The travel document Issuer must ensure that the Personalisation Agents
  acting on his behalf
      (i) establish the correct identity of the travel document holder and create
          the biographical data for the travel document,
      (ii) enroll the biometric reference data of the travel document holder,
      (iii) write a subset of these data on the physical Passport (optical
          personalisation) and store them in the travel document (electronic
          personalisation) for the travel document holder as defined in [ICAO-
          9303],
      (iv) write the document details data,
      (v) write the initial TSF data,

          of a DS).

4.2.3 Terminal operator: Terminal receiving branch

OE.Terminal
  Terminal operating
  The terminal operators must operate their terminals as follows:
     1.) The related terminals (basic inspection systems, cf. above) are used by
        terminal operators and by travel document holders as defined in [ICAO-
        9303].
     2.) The related terminals implement the terminal parts of the PACE
        protocol [ICAO-9303] part 11, of the Passive Authentication [ICAO-
        9303] part 11 (by verification of the signature of the Document Security

         and (almost) uniformly selected nonces, if required by the protocols (for
         generating ephemeral keys for Diffie-Hellmann).
      3.) The related terminals need not to use any own credentials.
      4.) The related terminals securely store the Country Signing Public Key
         and the Document Signer Public Key (in form of CCSCA and CDS) in
         order to enable and to perform Passive Authentication of the travel
         document (determination of the authenticity of data groups stored in
         the travel document, [ICAO-9303] part 12).
      5.) The related terminals and their environment must ensure
         confidentiality and integrity of respective data handled by them (e.g.
         confidentiality of the PACE passwords, integrity of PKI certificates, etc.),
         where it is necessary for a secure operation of the TOE according to the
         current PP.

4.2.4 Travel document holder Obligations

OE.Travel_Document_Holder
  Travel document holder Obligations
  The travel document holder may reveal, if necessary, his or her verification
  values of the PACE password to an authorized person or device who definitely
  act according to respective regulations and are trustworthy.

4.2.5 Receiving State or Organisation

OE.Exam_Travel_Document
  Examination of the physical part of the travel document
  The inspection system of the receiving State or Organisation must examine
  the travel document presented by the traveler to verify its authenticity by
  means of the physical security measures and to detect any manipulation of the
  physical part of the travel document. The Basic Inspection System for global
  interoperability (i) includes the Country Signing CA Public Key and the
  Document Signer Public Key of each issuing State or Organisation, and (ii)
  implements the terminal part of PACE [ICAO-9303] part 11 and/or the Basic
  Access Control [ICAO-9303]. Extended Inspection Systems perform
  additionally to these points the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1 to verify
  the Authenticity of the presented travel document’s chip.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Counterfeit and the Assumption A.Insp_Sys by demanding the Inspection
  System       to     perform     the     Chip     Authentication     protocolv.1.
  OE.Exam_Travel_Document also repeats partly the requirements from
  OE.Terminal in [PACE-PP] and therefore also counters T.Forgery and A.

      Active Authentication - Inspection Systems5
      An Active Authentication (Basic, General or Extended) Inspection system
      performs all the functions of the Basic, General and Extended Inspection
      System, and verifies the IC authenticity with an RSA or ECDSA signature
      generated by the MRTD (if available).



OE.Prot_Logical_Travel_Document
  Protection of data from the logical travel document
  The inspection system of the receiving State or Organisation ensures the
  confidentiality and integrity of the data read from the logical travel document.
  The inspection system will prevent eavesdropping to their communication with
  the TOE before secure messaging is successfully established based on the Chip
  Authentication Protocol Version 1.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP]in order to handle the Assumption
  A.Insp_Sys by requiring the Inspection System to perform secure messaging
  based on the Chip Authentication Protocol v.1.

OE.Ext_Insp_Systems
  Authorization of Extended Inspection Systems
  The Document Verifier of receiving States or Organisations authorizes
  Extended Inspection Systems by creation of Inspection System Certificates for
  access to sensitive biometric reference data of the logical travel document.
  The Extended Inspection System authenticates themselves to the travel
  document’s chip for access to the sensitive biometric reference data with its
  private Terminal Authentication Key and its Inspection System Certificate.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Read_Sensitive_Data, the Organisational Security Policy P.Sensitive_Data
  and the Assumption A. Auth_PKI as it specifies the pre-requisite for the
  Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 as it concerns the responsibilities of the
  Document Verifier and the Inspection Systems.

4.3 Security Objectives Rationale

4.3.1 Threats

4.3.1.1 Threats listed in PP PACE

T.Skimming addresses accessing the User Data (stored on the TOE or
  transferred between the TOE and the terminal) using the TOE's
  contactless/contact interface. This threat is countered by the security
  objectives        OT.Data_Integrity,        OT.Data_Authenticity        and
  OT.Data_Confidentiality through the PACE authentication. The objective
  OE.Travel_Document_Holder ensures that a PACE session can only be
  established either by the travel document holder itself or by an authorised
  person or device, and, hence, cannot be captured by an attacker.

T.Eavesdropping addresses listening to the communication between the TOE
  and a rightful terminal in order to gain the User Data transferred there. This
  threat is countered by the security objective OT.Data_Confidentiality through a
  trusted channel based on the PACE authentication.

T.Tracing addresses gathering TOE tracing data identifying it remotely by
  establishing or listening to a communication via the contactless/contact
  interface of the TOE, whereby the attacker does not a priori know the correct
  values of the PACE password. This threat is directly countered by security
  objectives    OT.Tracing   (no    gathering   TOE     tracing    data)   and
  OE.Travel_Document_Holder (the attacker does not a priori know the correct
  values of the shared passwords).

T.Forgery 'Forgery of data' addresses the fraudulent, complete or partial
  alteration of the User Data or/and TSF-data stored on the TOE or/and
  exchanged between the TOE and the terminal. Additionally to the security
  objectives from PACE PP [PACE-PP] which counter this threat, the examination
  of     the     presented   MRTD       passport    book       according    to
  OE.Exam_Travel_Document 'Examination of the physical part of the travel
  document' shall ensure its authenticity by means of the physical security
  measures and detect any manipulation of the physical part of the travel
  document.
  The threat T.Forgery also addresses the fraudulent, complete or partial
  alteration of the User Data or/and TSF-data stored on the TOE or/and
                        Security Target Lite
                                                                    Ref.:
                 IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy

                 Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic
                                                                Page: 64/150
                       eMRTD Configuration)

  exchanged between the TOE and the terminal. The security objective
  OT.AC_Pers requires the TOE to limit the write access for the travel document
  to the trustworthy Personalisation Agent (cf. OE.Personalisation). The TOE will
  protect the integrity and authenticity of the stored and exchanged User Data
  or/and TSF-data as aimed by the security objectives OT.Data_Integrity and
  OT.Data_Authenticity, respectively. The objectives OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper and
  OT.Prot_Abuse-Func contribute to protecting integrity of the User Data or/and
  TSF-data stored on the TOE. A terminal operator operating his terminals
  according to OE.Terminal and performing the Passive Authentication using the
  Document Security Object as aimed by OE.Passive_Auth_Sign will be able to
  effectively verify integrity and authenticity of the data received from the TOE.

T.Abuse-Func addresses attacks of misusing TOE's functionality to manipulate
  or to disclosure the stored User- or TSF-data as well as to disable or to bypass
  the soft-coded security functionality. The security objective OT.Prot_Abuse-
  Func ensures that the usage of functions having not to be used in the
  operational phase is effectively prevented.

T.Information_Leakage is typical for integrated circuits like smart cards under
  direct attack with high attack potential. The protection of the TOE against this
  threat is obviously addressed by the directly related security objective
  OT.Prot_Inf_Leak.

T.Phys-Tamper is typical for integrated circuits like smart cards under direct
  attack with high attack potential. The protection of the TOE against this threat
  is obviously addressed by the directly related security objective OT.Prot_Phys-
  Tamper.

T.Malfunction is typical for integrated circuits like smart cards under direct
  attack with high attack potential. The protection of the TOE against this threat
  is obviously addressed by the directly related security objective
  OT.Prot_Malfunction.

4.3.1.2 Additional Threats

T.Read_Sensitive_Data The threat T.Read_Sensitive_Data 'Read the sensitive
  biometric    reference   data'    is  countered     by    the   TOE-objective
  OT.Sens_Data_Conf 'Confidentiality of sensitive biometric reference data'
  requiring that read access to EF.DG3 and EF.DG4 (containing the sensitive
  biometric reference data) is only granted to authorized inspection systems.
  Furthermore it is required that the transmission of these data ensures the
  data's confidentiality. The authorization bases on Document Verifier
  certificates issued by the issuing State or Organisation as required by
  OE.Authoriz_Sens_Data 'Authorization for use of sensitive biometric reference
  data'. The Document Verifier of the receiving State has to authorize Extended
  Inspection Systems by creating appropriate Inspection System certificates for

  access to the sensitive biometric reference data as demanded                by
  OE.Ext_Insp_Systems 'Authorization of Extended Inspection Systems'.

T.Counterfeit 'Counterfeit of travel document chip data' addresses the attack of
  unauthorized copy or reproduction of the genuine travel document's chip. This
  attack is thwarted by chip an identification and authenticity proof required by
  OT.Chip_Auth_Proof 'Proof of travel document's chip authentication' using an
  authentication key pair to be generated by the issuing State or Organisation.
  The Public Chip Authentication Key has to be written into EF.DG14 and signed
  by    means     of  Documents       Security    Objects    as   demanded     by
  OE.Auth_Key_Travel_Document 'Travel document Authentication Key'.
  According to OE.Exam_Travel_Document 'Examination of the physical part of
  the travel document' the General Inspection system has to perform the Chip
  Authentication Protocol Version 1 to verify the authenticity of the travel
  document's chip. Moreover, the Active Authentication Public Key has to be
  written into EF.DG15 as demanded by OE.Auth_Key_MRTD 'MRTD
  Authentication Key'. According to OE.AA_MRTD 'Active Authentication -
  Inspection Systems' the Inspection system has to perform the Active
  Authentication Protocol to verify the authenticity of the MRTD’s chip.

  fulfilled by OT.Identification.

P.Pre-Operational is enforced by the following security objectives:
  OT.Identification is affine to the OSP's property 'traceability before the
  operational phase; OT.AC_Pers and OE.Personalisation together enforce the
  OSP's properties 'correctness of the User and the TSF-data stored' and
  'authorisation of Personalisation Agents'; OE.Legislative_Compliance is affine
  to the OSP's property 'compliance with laws and regulations'.

P.Card_PKI is enforced by establishing the issuing PKI branch as aimed by the
  objectives OE.Passive_Auth_Sign (for the Document Security Object).

P.Trustworthy_PKI is enforced by OE.Passive_Auth_Sign (for CSCA, issuing
  PKI branch).

P.Terminal 'Abilities and trustworthiness of terminals' is countered by the
  security objective OE.Exam_Travel_Document additionally to the security
  objectives from PACE PP [PACE-PP]. OE.Exam_Travel_Document enforces the
  terminals to perform the terminal part of the PACE protocol.
  The OSP P.Terminal is obviously enforced by the objective OE.Terminal,
  whereby the one-to-one mapping between the related properties is applicable.



4.3.2.2 Additional OSPs from PP EAC

P.Sensitive_Data 'Privacy of sensitive biometric reference data' is fulfilled and
  the threat T.Read_Sensitive_Data 'Read the sensitive biometric reference data'
  is countered by the TOE-objective OT.Sens_Data_Conf 'Confidentiality of
  sensitive biometric reference data' requiring that read access to EF.DG3 and
  EF.DG4 (containing the sensitive biometric reference data) is only granted to
  authorized inspection systems. Furthermore it is required that the
  transmission of these data ensures the data's confidentiality. The authorization
  bases on Document Verifier certificates issued by the issuing State or
  Organisation as required by OE.Authoriz_Sens_Data 'Authorization for use of
  sensitive biometric reference data'. The Document Verifier of the receiving
  State has to authorize Extended Inspection Systems by creating appropriate
  Inspection System certificates for access to the sensitive biometric reference
  data as demanded by OE.Ext_Insp_Systems 'Authorization of Extended
  Inspection Systems'.

P.Personalisation 'Personalisation of the travel document by issuing State or
  Organisation only' addresses the (i) the enrolment of the logical travel
  document by the Personalisation Agent as described in the security objective
  for the TOE environment OE.Personalisation 'Personalisation of logical travel
  document', and (ii) the access control for the user data and TSF data as
  described by the security objective OT.AC_Pers 'Access Control for
  Personalisation of logical travel document'. Note the manufacturer equips the
  TOE with the Personalisation Agent Key(s) according to OT.Identification
  'Identification and Authentication of the TOE'. The security objective
  OT.AC_Pers limits the management of TSF data and the management of TSF
  to the Personalisation Agent.

5 Extended Requirements


5.1 Definition of the Family FAU_SAS
To describe the security functional requirements of the TOE, the family FAU_SAS
of the class FAU (Security Audit) is defined here. This family describes the
functional requirements for the storage of audit data. It has a more general
approach than FAU_GEN, because it does not necessarily require the data to be
generated by the TOE itself and because it does not give specific details of the
content of the audit records.

The family “Audit data storage (FAU_SAS)” is specified as follows:

Family behavior:

This family defines functional requirements for the storage of audit data.

Component leveling:




FAU_SAS.1          Requires the TOE to provide the possibility to store audit data.

Management:        FAU_SAS.1
                   There are no management activities foreseen.

Audit:             FAU_SAS.1
                   There are no actions defined to be auditable.
