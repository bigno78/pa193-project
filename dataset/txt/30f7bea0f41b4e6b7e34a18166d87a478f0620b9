Application Note: The application note 42 of [PP_BAC] applies. This application note provides a definition, what
is meant by “Pre-personalization Data”. This definition is also applicable to FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA from
[PP_SAC]. Therefore FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be combined.

Dependencies:           No dependencies.
FPT_TST.1.1             The TSF shall run a suite of self tests during initial start-up, to demonstrate the correct
                        operation of the TSF.
FPT_TST.1.2             The TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to verify the integrity of the
                        TSF data.
FPT_TST.1.3             The TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to verify the integrity of
                        stored TSF executable code.
Application Note: There is no contradiction between application note 46 of [PP_BAC] and application note 52 of
[PP_SAC]. In fact, although the wording is slightly different, the meaning of these application notes is identical.
Therefore either of these application notes applies and FPT_TST.1 from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be
combined.

                        responding automatically such that the SFRs are always enforced.
Application Note: Application note 47 of [PP_BAC] and 53 of [PP_SAC] are equivalent. Application note 48 of
[PP_BAC] is only informative to the reader in the sense, that it provides a context to an older CC standard, but
not relevant for the interpretation of FPT_PHP.3. Therefore either application note 47 of [PP_BAC] or
application note 53 of [PP_SAC] applies and FPT_PHP.3 from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be combined.

Application Note: 3DES in CBC mode is used with key size of 112 bit. AES in CBC mode is used with key size of
128, 192 or 256 bit. The TOE implements the cryptographic primitives (i.e. Triple-DES and AES) for secure
messaging with encryption of the transmitted data and encrypting the nonce in the first step of PACE. The keys

                                                                                                 Part of the procedure is the technical examination (evaluation) of the product, protection profile or site

FMT_MTD.1.1/INI_ENA The TSF shall restrict the ability to write the Initialisation Data and Pre-personalisation
                    Data to the Manufacturer.
Application Note: The application note 42 of [PP_BAC] applies. This application note provides a definition, what
is meant by “Pre-personalization Data”. This definition is also applicable to FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA from
[PP_SAC]. Therefore FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be combined.

6.2.3              Class FPT Protection of the Security Functions
FPT_TST.1               TSF testing
Hierarchical to:        No other components.
Dependencies:           No dependencies.
FPT_TST.1.1             The TSF shall run a suite of self tests during initial start-up, to demonstrate the correct
                        operation of the TSF.
FPT_TST.1.2             The TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to verify the integrity of the
                        TSF data.
FPT_TST.1.3             The TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to verify the integrity of
                        stored TSF executable code.
Application Note: There is no contradiction between application note 46 of [PP_BAC] and application note 52 of
[PP_SAC]. In fact, although the wording is slightly different, the meaning of these application notes is identical.
Therefore either of these application notes applies and FPT_TST.1 from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be
combined.


FPT_PHP.3               Resistance to physical attack
Hierarchical to:        No other components.
Dependencies:           No dependencies.
FPT_PHP.3.1             The TSF shall resist physical manipulation and physical probing to the TSF by
                        responding automatically such that the SFRs are always enforced.
Application Note: Application note 47 of [PP_BAC] and 53 of [PP_SAC] are equivalent. Application note 48 of
[PP_BAC] is only informative to the reader in the sense, that it provides a context to an older CC standard, but
not relevant for the interpretation of FPT_PHP.3. Therefore either application note 47 of [PP_BAC] or
application note 53 of [PP_SAC] applies and FPT_PHP.3 from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be combined.

Dependencies:           [FCS_CKM.2 Cryptographic key distribution or FCS_COP.1 Cryptographic operation]
                        Justification: A Diffie-Hellman key agreement is used in order to have no key
                        distribution, therefore FCS_CKM.2 makes no sense in this case. FCS_CKM.4
                        Cryptographic key destruction: fulfilled by FCS_CKM.4
FCS_CKM.1.1/DH_PACE       The TSF shall generate cryptographic keys in accordance with a specified

FCS_COP.1.1/PACE_ENC      The TSF shall perform secure messaging – encryption and decryption in

Application Note: 3DES in CBC mode is used with key size of 112 bit. AES in CBC mode is used with key size of
128, 192 or 256 bit. The TOE implements the cryptographic primitives (i.e. Triple-DES and AES) for secure
messaging with encryption of the transmitted data and encrypting the nonce in the first step of PACE. The keys
are agreed between the TOE and the terminal as part of the PACE protocol according to FCS_CKM.1/DH_PACE.
