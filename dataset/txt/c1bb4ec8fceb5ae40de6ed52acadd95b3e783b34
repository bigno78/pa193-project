                 1.2 TOE Overview
                      The TOE consists of the Micro Controller and a software stack which is stored on the
                      Micro Controller and which can be executed by the Micro Controller. The software stack
                      can be further split into the following components:
                      • Firmware for booting and low level functionality of the Micro Controller (MC FW)
                        like writing to flash memory. This includes software for implementing cryptographic
                        operations, called Crypto Library.
                      • Software for implementing a Java Card Virtual Machine [15], a Java Card Runtime
                        Environment [16] and a Java Card Application Programming Interface [14], called
                        JCVM, JCRE and JCAPI.
                      • Software for implementing content management according to GlobalPlatform [17],
                        called GlobalPlatform (GP) Framework.
                      • Software for executing native libraries, called Secure Box.
                      The TOE is referred to as JCOP 4.7 SE051. The JCOP 4 Operating System (JCOP 4
                      OS) consists of the software stack without the Crypto Library (Crypto Lib) and without
                      the Micro Controller Firmware (MC FW). The TOE uses one or more communication
                      interfaces to communicate with its environment.
                      The complete TOE is depicted in Figure 1. The elements are described in more detail in
                      Section 1.3 "TOE Description".

 Figure 1. Components of the TOE

                               Figure 1 shows the components of the TOE. The TOE is a composite product on top
                               of CC certified Hardware, Firmware and Crypto Library. Part of the TOE are the JCVM,
                               JCRE, JCAPI and the GP Framework. Also included is optional functionality and the
                               Secure Box mechanism. The Secure Box Native Librarys provide native functions for
                               untrusted third parties and are not part of the TOE.
                               The figure shows Java Card applets which are small programs in Java language that can
                               be executed by the TOE, but are not part of the TOE.

                     1.2.1 Usage and Major Security Features of the TOE
                               The usage of the TOE is focused on security critical applications in small form factors.
                               One main usage scenario is the use of so called smart cards. Examples of such cards
                               are banking cards or electronic drivers’ licenses. The TOE can also be used in an
                               electronic passport. Another usage scenario is device authentication, where the TOE can
                               be used to prove the authenticity or originality of a device like an accessory for a gaming
                               console.
                               The TOE provides a variety of security features. The hardware of the Micro Controller
                               already protects against logical and physical attacks by applying various sensors to
                               detect manipulations and by processing data in ways which protect against leakage
                               of data by side channel analysis. With the software stack the TOE provides many

                 1.2.2 TOE Type
                      The TOE is a Java Card with a GP Framework. It can be used to load and execute off-
                      card verified Java Card applets.

                 1.2.3 Required non-TOE Hardware/Software/Firmware
                      Three groups of users shall be distinguished here.
                      The first group is the end-users group, which uses the TOE with one or more loaded
                      applets in the final form factor like a banking card or an electronic passport. These users
                      only require a communication device to be able to communicate with the TOE. The
                      communication protocol of the TOE is standardized in either ISO7816 [31] (T=1, T=0),
                      ISO14443 [32] (T=CL), or UM10204 [33] (I2C Slave).
                      The second group of users are administrators of cards. They want to configure the
                      card by using the Configuration Module, to install additional applets and to configure and
                      personalise these applets. These users require the same equipment as end-users.
                      The third group of users wants to develop Java Card applets and execute them on
                      the TOE. These applet developers need in addition to the communication device a
                      set of tools for the development of applets. This set of tools can be obtained from the
                      TOE vendor and comprises elements such as PC development environment, byte code
                      verifier, compiler, linker and debugger.

                     1.3 TOE Description

                    1.3.1 TOE Components and Composite Certification
                           The certification of this TOE is a composite certification. The following sections provide
                           a more detailed description of the components of Figure 1. It is also made clear whether
                           a component is covered by a previous certification or whether it is covered in the
                           certification of this TOE.

                  1.3.1.1 Micro Controller

                           The Micro Controller is a secure smart card controller from NXP’s SmartMX3 family.
                           The Micro Controller contains a co-processor for symmetric cryptographic operations,
                           supporting DES and AES, as well as an accelerator for asymmetric cryptographic
                           algorithms. The Micro Controller further contains a physical random number generator.
                           The supported memory technologies are volatile (Random Access Memory (RAM)) and
                           non-volatile (Read Only Memory (ROM) and FLASH) memory.
                           Access to all memory types is controlled by a Memory Management Unit (MMU) which
                           allows to separate and restrict access to parts of the memory.
                           The Micro Controller has been certified in a previous certification and the results are re-
                           used for this certification. The exact reference to the previous certification is given in the
                           following Table 2 "Reference to Certified Micro Controller":

                           Table 2. Reference to Certified Micro Controller

                                                                          [1]

                           Certification ID                BSI-DSZ-CC-1040
                           Reference                       [10]

                           [1]   The SE051 hardware is an instantiation of the N7121 hard macro with I2C side-car.


                  1.3.1.2 Security IC Dedicated Software

                 1.3.1.2.1 MC FW (Micro Controller Firmware)

                           The Micro Controller Firmware is used for testing of the Micro Controller at production,
                           for booting of the Micro Controller after power-up or after reset, for configuration of
                           communication devices and for writing data to volatile and non-volatile memory.
                           The MC FW has been certified together with the Micro Controller and the same reference
                           [10] as given for the Micro Controller also apply for the MC FW.

                 1.3.1.2.2 Crypto Library

                           The Crypto Library provides implementations for symmetric and asymmetric
                           cryptographic operations, hashing, the generation of hybrid deterministic and hybrid
                           physical random numbers and further functions like secure copy and compare.
                           Some of the cryptographic algorithms offered by the Crypto Lib are not certified, see
                           Section 1.3.1.4 "Excluded functionality".
                           The symmetric cryptographic operations comprise the algorithms 3DES and AES. These
                           algorithms use the symmetric co-processor of the Micro Controller.

                          The supported asymmetric cryptographic operations are ECC and RSA. These
                          algorithms use the Public Key Crypto Coprocessor (PKCC) of the Micro Controller for the
                          cryptographic operations.
                          The Crypto Library has been certified together with the Micro Controller and the same
                          reference [10] as given for the Micro Controller also applies.

                  1.3.1.3 Security IC Embedded Software

                 1.3.1.3.1 JCOP 4.7 SE051

                          The OS of the TOE consists of JCVM, JCRE, JCAPI and GP framework. It is
                          implemented according to the Java Card Specification and GlobalPlatform. Additionally it
                          consists of a proprietary API, which is described in the UGM [9].
                          The TOE can be identified by using the IDENTIFY APDU command (see UGM [9]). This
                          command returns the card identification data, which includes a Platform ID, a Patch ID
                          and other information that allows to identify the content in ROM, FLASH and loaded
                          patches (if any).
                          The TOE also includes a Configuration Module (see Section 1.3.2 "Optional TOE
                          Functionality") which is used for personalisation and configuration of the TOE. It must be
                          deleted after the personalisation is finished (end of Phase 6 ”Personalisation”) by using
                          the DELETE APDU command. Once the Configuration Module is deleted, it is no longer
                          possible to configure the TOE.
                          The TOE contains further functionality for integrity protection of user data via an
                          EDC, encryption of user data via PUF [12] and optional functionality as described in
                          Section 1.3.2 "Optional TOE Functionality".

                  1.3.1.4 Excluded functionality

                          All Secure Box Native Libraries are not part of the TOE. No security functional
                          requirements are claimed on AES CCM, HMAC, HKDF, ECDAA, elliptic curve
                          cryptography based on Edwards and Montgomery curves and FIPS self-tests, they are

                  1.3.3 TOE Reduced Feature Set
                        The TOE is also available to customers with a reduced feature set. This variant of the
                        TOE contains a different base mask configuraton and has some features removed from
                        the TOE. The removed features are:
                        •   No support for SecureBox
                        •   No RSA support in GP
                        •   No DES support in GP
                        •   SCP01 not supported
                        •   SCP02 not supported
                        •   GP CVM service not supported
                        •   GP command chaining is not supported
                        •   ISO 7816 T=1, T=0 (UART) interface not supported
                        The base mask with the reduced feature set is known as IOT Reduced, while the base
                        mask with full functionality is known as IOT Full. For more information on the difference
                        in feature set, please refer to Table 3.1 in the User Guidance and Administration Manual
                        [9].

                 1.3.3.1 Reduced Security Functional Requirements

                        Some security functionality claimed in this Security Target is no longer available in the
                        IOT Reduced base mask or has limited functionality and the corresponding Security
                        Functional Requirements are not (completely) applicable for this variant of the TOE. The

                      The evaluation process is limited to phases 1 to 5. User Applet development is outside
                      the scope of this evaluation. Applets can be loaded into FLASH in phases 3, 4, 5, and 6.
                      Applet loading in phase 7 is also allowed. This means post-issuance loading of applets
                      can be done for a certified TOE.
                      The Configuration Module is loaded into FLASH and has special privileges to personalize
                      and configure the TOE. Before life cycle Phase 7 "Operational Use" the Configuration
                      Module is deleted and hence it is ensured that its functionality cannot be used
                      afterwards. It is possible to load patch code into FLASH in phases 3, 4, 5, and 6. The
                      certification is only valid for the ROM code having the Platform Identifiers and the Patch
                      IDs (if applicable) as stated in Table 5 "Delivery Items".
                      The delivery process from NXP to their customers (to phase 4 or phase 5 of the life
                      cycle) guarantees that the customer is aware of the exact versions of the different parts
                      of the TOE as outlined above.

                         DIAG, A.USE_KEYS) that users handle securely the TOE and related Objectives for the
                         environment are defined (OE.USE_DIAG, OE.USE_KEYS).

                 1.3.5.2 TOE Identification

                         The TOE can be identified by using the Platform ID, the FLASH ID and the Patch ID. The
                         IDENTIFY command and the identification output for this TOE are described in detail
                         in Chapter 2 of the UGM [9]. The IDENTIFY command also returns information about
                         presence of optional functionality and allows to identify the IOT Full and IOT Reduced
                         base mask configuration.

                  1.3.6 Evaluated Package Types
                         A number of package types are supported for this TOE. All package types, which are
                         covered by the certification of the used hardware (see [10]), are also allowed to be used
                         in combination with each product of this TOE.
                         The package types do not influence the security functionality of the TOE. They only
                         define which pads are connected in the package and for what purpose and in which
                         environment the chip can be used. Note that the security of the TOE is not dependent on

2       Conformance Claims (ASE_CCL)
                      This Chapter is divided into the following sections: "CC Conformance Claim", "Package
                      Claim", "PP Claim", and "Conformance Claim Rationale".

                  2.1 CC Conformance Claim
                      This Security Target claims to be conformant to version 3.1 of Common Criteria for
                      Information Technology Security Evaluation according to
                      • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 1, Version 3.1,
                        Revision 5, April 2017" [1]
                      • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 2, Version 3.1,
                        Revision 5, April 2017" [2]
                      • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 3, Version 3.1,
                        Revision 5, April 2017" [3]
                      The following methodology will be used for the evaluation:
                      • Common Methodology for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Evaluation
                        Methodology, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April 2017" [4]
                      This Security Target claims to be CC Part 2 extended and CC Part 3 conformant.
                      The extended Security Functional Requirements are defined in Section 6 "Extended
                      Components Definition (ASE_ECD)".

                  2.2 Package Claim
                      This Security Target claims conformance to the assurance package EAL6. The
                      augmentation to EAL6 is ASE_TSS.2 “TOE summary specification with architectural
                      design summary” and ALC_FLR.1 “Basic flaw remediation”.

                  2.3 PP Claim
                      The Security Target claims demonstrable conformance to the Java Card System -
                      Open Configuration Protection Profile, December 2017, Version 3.0.5 [6], certified by
                      Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI, BSI-CC-PP-0099-2017). The
                      Java Card Protection Profile makes the use of Java Card RMI optional. The TOE does
                      not support Java Card RMI. This ST is more restrictive than the PP [6] which Section 2.4
                      "Conformance Claim Rationale" provides a rational for.

                  2.4 Conformance Claim Rationale

                 2.4.1 TOE Type
                      The TOE type as stated in Section Section 1.2 "TOE Overview" of this ST corresponds
                      to the TOE type of the PP as stated in Section 2.1 of [6] namely a Java Card platform,
                      implementing the Java Card Specification Version 3.0.5 [15], [16], [14].

                  2.4.2 SPD Statement

                 2.4.2.1 Threats

                         The Security Problem Definition (SPD) statement that is presented in Section 4 "Security
                         Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)" includes the threats as presented in the PP [6], but also
                         includes additional threats. These threats are:
                         •   T.OS_OPERATE
                         •   T.RND
                         •   T.COM_EXPLOIT
                         •   T.LIFE_CYCLE
                         •   T.UNAUTHORIZED_CARD_MNGT
                         •   T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA[REFINED]
                         •   T.CONFIG
                         •   T.SEC_BOX_BORDER
                         •   T.MODULE_EXEC
                         •   T.MODULE_REPLACEMENT
                         The threat T.OS_OPERATE is an additional threat added to cover incorrect operating
                         system behavior, it is an addition to the threats in the PP [6].
                         The threat T.RND is taken from the Security IC PP [5].
                         The threat T.COM_EXPLOIT is included to cover communication channels attacks and it
                         is an addition to the threats in the PP [6].
                         The threat T.LIFE_CYCLE is included to cover content management attacks and it is an
                         addition to the threats in the PP [6].
                         The threat T.UNAUTHORIZED_CARD_MNGT refines the threats T.INSTALL and
                         T.DELETION from the Security IC PP [5].
                         The threat T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA[REFINED] refines the threat T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA in
                         the Security IC PP [5].
                         The threat T.CONFIG is an additional threat to cover unauthorized modifications and
                         read access of the configuration area in the TOE. It is an addition to the threats defined in
                         the PP [6].
                         The threat T.SEC_BOX_BORDER is included for the Secure Box which is additional
                         functionality the PP [6] allows.
                         The threats T.MODULE_EXEC and T.MODULE_REPLACEMENT are included for the
                         Modular Design which is additional functionality the PP [6] allows. Furthermore some
                         threats from the PP [6] are refined to cover additional assets from the Modular Design.
                         This comprises threats T.CONFID-JCS-CODE, T.CONFID-JCS-DATA, T.INTEG-APPLI-
                         CODE, T.INTEG-JCS-CODE, T.INTEG-JCS-DATA, and T.SID.1.
                         Note that the threat T.EXE-CODE-REMOTE is not included, since the TOE does not
                         support Java Card RMI. The Java Card Protection Profile [6] makes the use of Java Card
                         RMI optional.

                        The OSP OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS is introduced for the SD feature of the TOE and is
                        an addition to the OSPs in PP [6].
                        The OSP.SECURE-BOX is introduced to allow execution of third party native code and is
                        an addition to the OSPs in PP [6].

                 2.4.2.3 Assumptions

                        The SPD statement includes two of the three assumptions from the PP [6]. The
                        assumption A.Deletion is excluded. The Card Manager is part of the TOE and therefore
                        the assumption is no longer relevant. Leaving out the assumption, makes the SPD of this
                        ST more restrictive than the SPD in the PP [6]. As the Card Manager is part of the TOE,
                        it is ensuring that the deletion of applets through the Card Manager is secure, instead of
                        assuming that it is handled by the Card Manager in the environment of the TOE.
                        Besides the assumptions from the PP [6], following additional assumptions are added:
                        •   A.PROCESS-SEC-IC
                        •   A.USE_DIAG
                        •   A.USE_KEYS
                        •   A.APPS-PROVIDER
                        •   A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY
                        The assumption A.PROCESS-SEC-IC is taken from the underlying certified Micro
                        Controller [10], which is compliant to the Security IC PP [5].
                        The assumptions A.USE_DIAG and A.USE_KEYS are included because the Card
                        Manager is part of the TOE and no longer part of the environment.
                        The assumptions A.APPS-PROVIDER and A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY are added
                        because Security Domains from the GlobalPlatform Specification are introduced. All the
                        applets and packages are signed by the Application Provider Security Domain (APSD)
                        and the correctness is verified on the TOE by Verification Authority Security Domain
                        (VASD) before the package or applet is installed or loaded. A.APPS-PROVIDER and
                        A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY are additions to PP [6] for card content management
                        environment.

                  2.4.3 Security Objectives Statement
                        The statement of security objectives in the ST presented in Section 5 "Security
                        Objectives" includes all security objectives as presented in the PP [6], but also includes a
                        number of additional security objectives. These security objectives are:
                        • OT.IDENTIFICATION
                        • OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS
                        • OT.APPLI-AUTH

                      •   OT.SECURE_LOAD_ACODE
                      •   OT.SECURE_ACTIVATION_ADDITIONAL_CODE
                      •   OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION
                      The security objective OT.IDENTIFICATION is part of the security objectives of the
                      certified Micro Controller [10] (see also Section 1.3.1.1 "Micro Controller") and Crypto
                      Lib [10] (see also Section 1.3.1.2.2 "Crypto Library"), which are also components of this
                      composite certification. Therefore the security objective statement is equivalent to the PP
                      [6] for these two security objectives. OT.IDENTIFICATION is also included for the pre-
                      personalisation feature of the TOE, which is additional functionality the PP allows.
                      The security objectives OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS, OT.APPLI-AUTH, OT.COMM_AUTH,
                      OT.COMM_INTEGRITY, OT.COMM_CONFIDENTIALITY are objectives for the TOE as
                      the GlobalPlatform API and the definitions for Secure Channel, Security Domains and
                      Card Content Management are used from it.
                      The security objectives OT.CARD-CONFIGURATION, OT.SECURE_LOAD_ACODE,
                      OT.SECURE_ACTIVATION_ADDITIONAL_COD0E, OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION are
                      related to the configuration of the TOE via the Configuration Module, which is additional
                      functionality the PP [6] allows.
                      The security objective OT.SEC_BOX_FW is related to the Secure Box, which is
                      additional functionality the PP allows.
                      The security objective OT.SID_MODULE is related to the Modular Design of the TOE,
                      which is additional functionality the PP [6] allows.
                      The security objective OT.RNG is related to the Random Number Generator, and is
                      taken from the Security IC PP [5].
                      The ST contains OE.APPLET, OE.VERIFICATION and OE.CODE-EVIDENCE from
                      Security Objectives for the Operational Environment from [6]. Additionally, some of the
                      Security Objectives for the Operational Environment from [6] are listed as TOE Security
                      Objectives in this ST:
                      •   OT.SCP.RECOVERY instead of OE.SCP.RECOVERY
                      •   OT.SCP.SUPPORT instead of OE.SCP.SUPPORT
                      •   OT.SCP.IC instead of OE.SCP.IC
                      •   OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT instead of OE.CARD-MANAGEMENT
                      OT.SCP.RECOVERY, OT.SCP.SUPPORT, and OT.SCP.IC are objectives for the
                      TOE as the Smart Card Platform belongs to the TOE for this evaluation. OT.CARD-
                      MANAGEMENT is an objective for the TOE as the Card Manager belongs to the TOE
                      for this evaluation. Moving objectives from the environment to the TOE adds objectives
                      to the TOE without changing the overall objectives. The statement of security objectives
                      is therefore equivalent to the security objectives in the PP [6] to which conformance is
                      claimed.

                       The security objectives O.INSTALL, O.LOAD, and O.DELETION from the PP [6] are not
                       included since these functionality and objectives are covered by the refined OT.CARD-
                       MANAGEMENT.
                       Note that the objective O.REMOTE is not included, since the TOE does not support Java
                       Card RMI. The Java Card Protection Profile makes the use of Java Card RMI optional.
                       A part of the security objectives for the environment defined in the PP [6] has been
                       included in this ST. The other part of security objectives for the environment, which is
                       present in the PP [6], is used as part of the security objectives for the TOE in this ST. The
                       ST also introduces following additional security objectives for the environment:
                       •   OE.PROCESS_SEC_IC
                       •   OE.USE_DIAG
                       •   OE.USE_KEYS
                       •   OE.APPS-PROVIDER
                       •   OE.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY
                       •   OE.KEY-CHANGE
                       •   OE.SECURITY-DOMAINS
                       The security objective for the environment OE.PROCESS_SEC_IC is from the hardware
                       platform (Micro Controller [10] see also Section 1.3.1.1 "Micro Controller") that is part of
                       this composite product evaluation. Therefore the statement of security objectives for the
                       environment is equivalent to the statement in the Security IC PP [5].
                       OE.USE_KEYS and OE.USE_DIAG are included because the Card Manager is part of
                       the TOE and not a security objective for the environment as in PP [6].
                       OE.APPS-PROVIDER and OE.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY cover trusted actors which
                       enable the creation, distribution and verification of secure applications.
                       OE.KEY-CHANGE covers the switch to trusted keys for the AP.
                       OE.SECURITY-DOMAINS covers the management of security domains in the context of
                       the GlobalPlatform Specification.
                       The statement of security objectives for the environment is therefore considered to be
                       equivalent to the security objectives in the PP [6] to which conformance is claimed.

                 2.4.4 Security Functional Requirements Statement
                       The statement of security functional requirements copies most SFRs as defined in the
                       PP [6], with the exception of a number of options. For the copied set of SFRs the ST is
                       considered equivalent to the statement of SFRs in the PP [6]. Moreover as requested
                       by the PP [6] the ST adds additional threats, objectives and SFRs to fully cover and
                       describe additional security functionality implemented in the TOE.
                       The TOE does not implement Java Card RMI, therefore this ST restricts remote access
                       from the CAD to the services implemented by the applets on the card to none. As a
                       result the SFRs concerning Java Card RMI (FDP_ACF.1/JCRMI, FDP_IFC.1/JCRMI,
                       FDP_IFF.1/JCRMI, FMT_MSA.1/EXPORT, FMT_MSA.1/REM_ REFS, FMT_MSA.3/
                       JCRMI, FMT_SMF.1/JCRMI, FMT_REV.1/JCRMI, and FMT_SMR.1/JCRMI) are not
                       included in the ST. In the PP [6] the use of the Java Card RMI is optional.
                       The SFR FDP_ITC.2/INSTALLER from the PP [6] is replaced by FDP_ITC.2[CCM] which
                       enforces the Security Domain access control policy and the Secure Channel Protocol
                       information flow policy and which are more restrictive than the PACKAGE LOADING
                       information flow control SFP from PP [6].

                      The set of SFRs that define the card content management mechanism CarG are partly
                      replaced or refined and are considered to be equivalent or more restrictive because of
                      the newly introduced SFPs:
                      1. Security Domain access control policy,
                      2. Secure Channel Protocol information flow policy
                      provide a concrete and more restrictive implementation of the PACKAGE LOADING
                      information flow control SFP from PP [6].
                      The table below lists the SFRs from CarG of PP [6] and their corresponding refinements

                      The following SFRs realize refinements of SFRs from PP [6] and add functionality to the

                      FDP_ROL.1[CCM] and FPT_FLS.1[CCM] realize additional security functionality for the

3       Security Aspects
                       This Chapter describes the main security issues of the Java Card System and its
                       environment addressed in this ST, called "security aspects", in a CC-independent way.
                       In addition to this, they also give a semi-formal framework to express the CC security
                       environment and objectives of the TOE. They can be instantiated as assumptions,
                       threats, objectives (for the TOE and the environment) or organizational security policies.
                       The description is based on [6].
                       This chapters described only the Security Aspects which have been added in comparison
                       to the PP [6].

                  3.1 Integrity

                 3.1.1 SA.INTEG-APPLI-DATA-PHYS: Integrity of Application Data (Sensitive
                       Result)
                       Integrity-sensitive application data must be protected against unauthorized modification
                       by physical attacks.

                  3.2 Configuration Module

                 3.2.1 SA.CONFIGURATION-MODULE: Configuration Module
                       The Configuration Module is a JCOP functionality which allows to read and modify
                       configuration items in the configuration area of the TOE.

                  3.3 Modular Design

                 3.3.1 SA.MODULAR-DESIGN: Modular Design
                       The TOE might contain one or more Modules implementing particular functionality. The
                       list of Modules present in the TOE must be retrievable. The Modules have an associated
                       AID which allows to identify them. The AID is equivalent to the Package AID of JavaCard
                       packages. Modules can only be deleted, re-loading of a previously deleted module or
                       replacing a present module must not be possible. Interfaces to a Module can be Public
                       or TOE internal. Public Interfaces can directly be accessed by any Applet or via an
                       APDU, TOE internal interfaces can only be accessed by the TOE itself, Applets use the
                       corresponding JavaCard API [14].

                 3.3.2 SA.MODULE-INVOCATION: Module Invocation
                       Invoking a module must be transparent to the user. If a Module has a TOE internal
                       interface, is not present and is invoked by the user, the TOE must preserve a secure
                       state by throwing an exception or returning an appropriate error status word to the CAD.

4       Security Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)
                       The Security Problem Definition is described within the following sections. Only additional
                       and refined items compared to the PP [6] are described.

                  4.1 Assets
                       Assets are security-relevant elements to be directly protected by the TOE. Confidentiality
                       of assets is always intended with respect to un-trusted people or software, as various
                       parties are involved during the first stages of the smart card product life-cycle. Details
                       concerning the threats are given in Section 4.2 "Threats" hereafter.
                       Assets have to be protected, some in terms of confidentiality and some in terms of
                       integrity or both integrity and confidentiality. These assets might get compromised by the
                       threats that the TOE is exposed to.
                       The assets to be protected by the TOE are listed below. They are grouped according to
                       whether it is data created by and for the user (User data) or data created by and for the
                       TOE (TSF data). This definition of grouping is taken from Section 5.1 of [6].

                                                          with the AP. These keys can be used to load and install applications
                                                          on the card if the Security Domain has the appropriate privileges. To
                                                          be protected from unauthorized disclosure and modification.

                                                          cryptographic keys are needed to perform card management
                                                          operations on the card. To be protected from unauthorized disclosure
                                                          and modification.

                                                          unauthorized modification.


                 4.1.2 TSF Data

                       D.CONFIG_ITEM                 A configuration that can be changed using the Configuration Mechanism.

                 4.2.1.1 T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA[REFINED]: Integrity of Application Data

                        The attacker executes an application to alter (part of) another application’s data.
                        Directly threatened asset(s): D.APP_I_ DATA, D.PIN, D.APP_KEYS, D.ISD_KEYS,
                        D.VASD_KEYS and S.APSD_KEYS.
                        This threat is a refinement of the Threat T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA from [6].

                  4.2.2 Unauthorized Execution

                 4.2.2.1 T.MODULE_EXEC: Code Execution of Modules

                        The attacker bypasses the presence check of a Module which is not present with
                        TOE internal interface to execute arbitrary code. See SA.MODULAR-DESIGN and
                        SA.MODULE-INVOCATION for details. Directly threatened asset(s): D.MODULE_
                        CODE.

                  4.2.3 Card Management

                 4.2.3.1 T.UNAUTHORIZED_CARD_MNGT: Unauthorized Card Management

                        The attacker performs unauthorized card management operations (for instance
                        impersonates one of the actor represented on the card) in order to take benefit of the
                        privileges or services granted to this actor on the card such as fraudulent:
                        •   load of a package file
                        •   installation of a package file
                        •   extradition of a package file or an applet
                        •   personalization of an applet or a Security Domain
                        •   deletion of a package file or an applet
                        •   privileges update of an applet or a Security Domain
                        Directly threatened asset(s): D.ISD_KEYS, D.APSD_KEYS, D.APP_C_DATA, D.APP_
                        I_DATA, D.APP_CODE, D.SEC_DATA, and D.CARD_MNGT_DATA (any other asset
                        may be jeopardized should this attack succeed, depending on the virulence of the
                        installed application).
                        This security objective is a refinement of the Threats T.INSTALL and T.DELETION from
                        [6].

                 4.2.3.2 T.COM_EXPLOIT: Communication Channel Remote Exploit

                        An attacker remotely exploits the communication channels established between a third
                        party and the TOE in order to modify or disclose confidential data.

                  4.2.4 Operating System

                 4.2.4.1 T.OS_OPERATE: Incorrect Operating System Behavior

                        Modification of the correct OS behavior by unauthorized use of TOE or use of incorrect
                        or unauthorized instructions or commands or sequence of commands, in order to obtain
                        an unauthorized execution of the TOE code. An attacker may cause a malfunction of TSF
                        or of the Smart Card embedded OS in order to (1) by-pass the security mechanisms (i.e.
                        authentication or access control mechanisms) or (2) obtain unexpected result from the
                        embedded OS behavior. Different kind of attack path may be used as:
                        1. Applying incorrect unexpected or unauthorized instructions, commands or command
                           sequences,
                        2. Provoking insecure state by insertion of interrupt (reset), premature termination of
                           transaction or communication between IC and the reading device.
                        Info: Any implementation flaw in the OS itself can be exploited with this attack path
                        to lead to an unsecured state of the state machine of the OS. The attacker uses the
                        available interfaces of the TOE. A user could have certain specified privileges that allow
                        loading of selected programs. Unauthorized programs, if allowed to be loaded, may
                        include either the execution of legitimate programs not intended for use during normal
                        operation (such as patches, filters, Trojan horses, etc.) or the unauthorized loading of
                        programs specifically targeted at penetration or modification of the security functions.
                        Attempts to generate a non-secure state in the Smart Card may also be made through
                        premature termination of transactions or communications between the IC and the card
                        reading device, by insertion of interrupts, or by selecting related applications that may
                        leave files open.

                  4.2.5 Random Numbers

                 4.2.5.1 T.RND: Deficiency of Random Numbers

                        An attacker may predict or obtain information about random numbers generated by
                        the TOE for instance because of a lack of entropy of the random numbers provided.
                        An attacker may gather information about the produced random numbers which might
                        be a problem because they may be used for instance to generate cryptographic keys.
                        Here the attacker is expected to take advantage of statistical properties of the random
                        numbers generated by the TOE without specific knowledge about the TOE’s generator.
                        Malfunctions or premature ageing are also considered which may assist in getting
                        information about random numbers.

                        An attacker may try to use malicious code placed in the Secure Box to modify the correct
                        behavior of the Operating System (OS). With the aim to
                        1. disclose the Java Card System code,

                        An attacker loads a Module with functionality differing from a previously deleted Module
                        to bypass TOE Security Functions. See SA.MODULAR-DESIGN for details. Directly
                        threatened assets: D.JCS_DATA.

                   4.3 Organisational Security Policies

                  4.3.1 OSP.PROCESS-TOE: Identification of the TOE
                        An accurate identification must be established for the TOE. This requires that each
                        instantiation of the TOE carries this identification.

                  4.3.2 OSP.KEY-CHANGE: Security Domain Keys Change
                        The Application Provider (AP) shall change its initial security domain keys (APSD) before
                        any operation on its Security Domain.

                  4.3.3 OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS: Security Domains
                        Security domains can be dynamically created, deleted and blocked during usage phase
                        in post-issuance mode.

                  4.3.4 OSP.SECURE-BOX: Secure Box Border
                        Execution of untrusted native code shall be possible without any harm, manipulation, or
                        influence on other parts of the TOE.

                   4.4 Assumptions
                        Note that the assumption A.DELETION is excluded. The Card Manager is part of the
                        TOE and therefore the assumption is no longer relevant.

                 4.4.2 A.USE_KEYS: Protected Storage of Keys Outside of TOE
                       It is assumed that the keys which are stored outside the TOE and which are used for
                       secure communication and authentication between Smart Card and terminals are
                       protected for confidentiality and integrity in their own storage environment. This is
                       especially true for D.APSD_KEYS, D.ISD_KEYS, and D.VASD_KEYS.
                       Info: This is to assume that the keys used in terminals or systems are correctly
                       protected for confidentiality and integrity in their own environment, as the disclosure of
                       such information which is shared with the TOE but is not under the TOE control, may
                       compromise the security of the TOE.

                 4.4.3 A.PROCESS-SEC-IC: Protection during Packaging, Finishing and
                       Personalisation
                       It is assumed that security procedures are used after delivery of the TOE by the TOE
                       Manufacturer up to delivery to the end consumer to maintain confidentiality and integrity
                       of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test data (to prevent any possible copy,
                       modification, retention, theft or unauthorised use). This means that the Phases after TOE
                       Delivery are assumed to be protected appropriately.
                       The assets to be protected are: The information and material produced and/or processed
                       by the Security IC Embedded Software Developer in Phase 1 and by the Composite
                       Product Manufacturer can be grouped as follows:
                       1. the Security IC Embedded Software including specifications, implementation and
                          related documentation,
                       2. pre-personalisation and personalisation data including specifications of formats and
                          memory areas, test related data,
                       3. the User Data and related documentation, and
                       4. material for software development support
                       as long as they are not under the control of the TOE Manufacturer.

                 4.4.4 A.APPS-PROVIDER: Application Provider
                       The AP is a trusted actor that provides basic or secure applications. He is responsible for
                       his security domain keys (APSD keys).
                       Info: An AP generally refers to the entity that issues the application. For instance it can
                       be a financial institution for a payment application such as EMV or a transport operator
                       for a transport application.

                 4.4.5 A.VERICATION-AUTHORITY: Verification Authority
                       The VA is a trusted actor who is able to guarantee and check the digital signature
                       attached to a basic or secure application.
                       Info: As a consequence, it guarantees the success of the application validation upon
                       loading.

5       Security Objectives
                        The Security Objectives for the TOE, for the operational environment and the security
                        objectives rationale are described within the following sections. Only additional and
                        refined items compared to the PP [6] are described.

                   5.1 Security Objectives for the TOE

                  5.1.1 Identification

                 5.1.1.1 OT.SID_MODULE: Subject Identification of Modules

                        The TOE shall uniquely identify every Module before granting it access to any service.

                  5.1.2 Execution

                 5.1.2.1 OT.SENSITIVE_RESULTS_INTEG: Sensitive Result

                        The TOE shall ensure that the sensitive results
                        (com.nxp.id.jcopx.security.SensitiveResultX) of sensitive operations executed by
                        applications through the Java Card API are protected in integrity specifically against
                        physical attacks.

                  5.1.3 Services

                 5.1.3.1 OT.RNG: Random Numbers Generation

                        The TOE shall ensure the cryptographic quality of random number generation. For
                        instance random numbers shall not be predictable and shall have sufficient entropy. The
                        TOE shall ensure that no information about the produced random numbers is available to
                        an attacker since they might be used for instance to generate cryptographic keys.

                  5.1.4 Applet Management

                 5.1.4.1 OT.APPLI-AUTH: Application Authentication

                        The card manager shall enforce the application security policies established by the card
                        issuer by requiring application authentication during application loading on the card. This
                        security objective is a refinement of the Security Objective O.LOAD from [6].
                        AppNote: Each application loaded onto the TOE has been signed by a VA. The VA
                        will guarantee that the security policies established by the card issuer on applications
                        are enforced. For example this authority (DAP) or a third party (Mandated DAP) can
                        be present on the TOE as a Security Domain whose role is to verify each signature at
                        application loading.

                 5.1.4.2 OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS: Domain Rights

                        The Card issuer shall not get access or change personalized AP Security Domain keys
                        which belong to the AP. Modification of a Security Domain keyset is restricted to the AP
                        who owns the security domain.

                        AppNote: APs have a set of keys that allows them to establish a secure channel between
                        them and the platform. These keys sets are not known by the TOE issuer. The security
                        domain initial keys are changed before any operation on the SD (OE.KEY-CHANGE).

                        The TOE shall authenticate the origin of the card management requests that the card
                        receives, and authenticate itself to the remote actor.

                 5.1.4.4 OT.COMM_INTEGRITY: Communication Request Integrity

                        The TOE shall verify the integrity of the card management requests that the card
                        receives.

                 5.1.4.5 OT.COMM_CONFIDENTIALITY: Communication Request Confidentiality

                        The TOE shall be able to process card management requests containing encrypted data.

                  5.1.5 Card Management

                 5.1.5.1 OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT: Card Management

                        The TOE shall provide card management functionalities (loading, installation, extradition,
                        deletion of applications and GP registry updates) in charge of the life cycle of the whole
                        device and installed applications (applets). The card manager, the application with
                        specific rights responsible for the administration of the smart card, shall control the
                        access to card management functions. It shall also implement the card issuer’s policy on
                        card management.
                        The Security Objective from [6] for the environment OE.CARD-MANAGEMENT is listed
                        as TOE Security Objective OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT for the TOE as the Card Manager
                        belongs to the TOE for this evaluation. This security objective is a refinement for the
                        Security Objectives O.INSTALL, O.LOAD, and O.DELETION from [6]. Thus, the following
                        objectives are also covered:
                        • The TOE shall ensure that the installation of an applet performs as expected (See
                          SA.INSTALL for details).
                        • The TOE shall ensure that the loading of a package into the card is secure.
                        • The TOE shall ensure that the deletion of a package from the TOE is secure.
                        AppNote: The card manager will be tightly connected in practice with the rest of the TOE,
                        which in return shall very likely rely on the card manager for the effective enforcement
                        of some of its security functions. The mechanism used to ensure authentication of
                        the TOE issuer, that manages the TOE, or of the Service Providers owning a Security
                        Domain with card management privileges is a secure channel. This channel will be
                        used afterwards to protect commands exchanged with the TOE in confidentiality and
                        integrity. The platform guarantees that only the ISD or the Service Providers owning a
                        Security Domain with the appropriate privilege (Delegated Management) can manage the
                        applications on the card associated with its Security Domain. This is done accordingly
                        with the card issuer’s policy on card management. The actor performing the operation
                        must beforehand authenticate with the Security Domain. In the case of Delegated
                        Management, the card management command will be associated with an electronic
                        signature (GlobalPlatform token) verified by the ISD before execution.
                        The Security Objective from [6] for the environment OE.CARD-MANAGEMENT is listed
                        as TOE Security Objective OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT for the TOE as the Card Manager

                         belongs to the TOE for this evaluation. This security objective is a refinement for the
                         Security Objectives O.INSTALL, O.LOAD, and O.DELETION from [6]. Thus, the following
                         AppNote applicable to O.DELETION applies also:
                         • Usurpation of identity resulting from a malicious installation of an applet on the card
                           may also be the result of perturbing the communication channel linking the CAD and
                           the card. Even if the CAD is placed in a secure environment, the attacker may try to
                           capture, duplicate, permute or modify the packages sent to the card. He may also try to
                           send one of its own applications as if it came from the card issuer. Thus, this objective
                           is intended to ensure the integrity and authenticity of loaded CAP files.

                  5.1.6 Smart Card Platform

                 5.1.6.1 OT.SCP.IC IC: Physical Protection

                         The SCP shall provide all IC security features against physical attacks. This security
                         objective for the environment refers to the point (7) of the security aspect SA.SCP.
                         AppNote: The Security Objectives from [6] for the environment OE.SCP.RECOVERY,
                         OE.SCP.SUPPORT, and OE.SCP.IC are listed as TOE Security Objectives

                         as the Smart Card Platform belongs to the TOE for this evaluation.

                 5.1.6.2 OT.SCP.RECOVERY: SCP Recovery

                         If there is a loss of power, or if the smart card is withdrawn from the CAD while an
                         operation is in progress, the SCP must allow the TOE to eventually complete the
                         interrupted operation successfully, or recover to a consistent and secure state. This
                         security objective for the environment refers to the security aspect SA.SCP.
                         AppNote: The Security Objectives from [6] for the environment OE.SCP.RECOVERY,

                 5.1.6.3 OT.SCP.SUPPORT: SCP Support

                         The SCP shall support the TSFs of the TOE. This security objective refers to the security
                         aspects 2, 3, 4 and 5 of SA.SCP.
                         AppNote: The Security Objectives from [6] for the environment OE.SCP.RECOVERY,

                 5.1.6.4 OT.IDENTIFICATION: TOE identification

                         The TOE must provide means to store Initialization Data and Pre-personalization Data
                         in its non-volatile memory. The Initialization Data (or parts of them) are used for TOE
                         identification.

                  5.1.7 Secure Box

                 5.1.7.1 OT.SEC_BOX_FW: SecureBox firewall

                        The TOE shall provide separation between the Secure Box native code and the Java
                        Card System. The separation shall comprise software execution and data access.

                  5.1.8 Configuration Module

                 5.1.8.1 OT.CARD-CONFIGURATION: Card Configuration

                        The TOE shall ensure that the customer can only configure customer configuration items
                        and that NXP can configure customer and NXP configuration items.

                 5.1.8.2 OT.SECURE_LOAD_ACODE: Secure loading of the Additional Code

                        This objective is taken over from [8].
                        The Loader of the Initial TOE shall check an evidence of authenticity and integrity of the
                        loaded Additional Code.
                                    Activation of the Additional Code and update of the Identification Data shall be performed
                        at the same time in an Atomic way.
                        All the operations needed for the code to be able to operate as in the Final TOE shall be
                        completed before activation.
                        If the Atomic Activation is successful, then the resulting product is the Final TOE,
                        otherwise (in case of interruption or incident which prevents the forming of the Final
                        TOE), the Initial TOE shall remain in its initial state or fail secure.

                 5.1.8.4 OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION: Secure identification of the TOE

                        This objective is taken over from [8] and further refined.
                        The Identification Data identifies the Initial TOE and Additional Code. The TOE provides
                        means to store Identification Data in its non-volatile memory and guarantees the integrity
                        of these data.
                        After Atomic Activation of the Additional Code, the Identification Data of the Final TOE
                        allows identifications of Initial TOE and Additional Code or the Final TOE. The user shall
                        be able to uniquely identify Initial TOE and Additional Code(s) or the final TOE which are
                        embedded in the Final TOE.

                  5.2 Security Objectives for the Operational Environment

                 5.2.1 OE.APPS-PROVIDER: Application Provider
                      The AP shall be a trusted actor that provides applications. The AP is responsible for its
                      security domain keys.

                 5.2.2 OE.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY: Verification Authority
                      The VA should be a trusted actor who is able to verify bytecode of an application loaded
                      on the card, guarantee and generate the digital signature attached to an application and
                      ensure that its public key for verifying the application signature is on the TOE.

                 5.2.3 OE.PROCESS_SEC_IC: Protection during composite product
                       manufacturing
                      Security procedures shall be used after TOE Delivery up to delivery to the end-consumer
                      to maintain confidentiality and integrity of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test
                      data (to prevent any possible copy, modification, retention, theft or unauthorised use).
                      This means that Phases after TOE Delivery up to the end of Phase 6 must be protected
                      appropriately.

                 5.2.4 OE.KEY-CHANGE: Security Domain Key Change
                      The AP must change its security domain initial keys before any operation on it.

                 5.2.5 OE.SECURITY-DOMAINS: Security Domains
                      Security domains can be dynamically created, deleted and blocked during usage phase
                      in post-issuance mode.

                 5.2.6 OE.USE_DIAG: Secure TOE communication protocols
                      Secure TOE communication protocols shall be supported and used by the environment.

                 5.2.7 OE.USE_KEYS: Protection of OPE keys
                      During the TOE usage, the terminal or system in interaction with the TOE shall ensure
                      the protection (integrity and confidentiality) of their own keys by operational means and/or
                      procedures.

                  5.3 Security Objectives Rationale
                      In this section it is proven that the security objectives described in Section 4 "Security
                      Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)" can be traced for all aspects identified in the TOE-
                      security environment and that they are suited to cover them. At least one security
                      objective results from each assumption, OSP, and each threat. At least one threat, one
                      OSP or assumption exists for each security objective.

1       ST Introduction
                       This chapter is divided into the following sections: "ST Reference", "TOE Reference",
                       "TOE Overview" and "TOE Description".


                 1.1 ST Reference
                       “NXP Secure Smart Card Controller P6022y VB, Security Target Lite, NXP
                       Semiconductors, Rev. 2.1, 6 April 2018”.


                 1.2 TOE Reference
                                                                                                                      *
                       The TOE is named "NXP Secure Smart Card Controller P6022y VB including IC
                       Dedicated Software". In this document the TOE is abbreviated to NXP Secure Smart
                       Card Controller P6022y VB.


                 1.3 TOE Overview


               1.3.1 Configuration of the TOE
                       The TOE is configurable to P6022P VB which includes IC Dedicated Software,
                       configurable to P6022X VB which includes IC Dedicated Software with extended
                       memory, configurable to P6022M VB which includes IC Dedicated Software with MIFARE
                       Plus MF1PLUSx0, configurable to P6022D VB which includes IC Dedicated Software
                       with MIFARE DESFire EV1, or configurable to P6022J VB which includes IC Dedicated
                       Software with both MIFARE Plus MF1PLUSx0 and MIFARE DESFire EV1.
                       MIFARE functionality does not implement any Security Functional Requirement and its
                       functionality is therefore not in the scope of the evaluation and does not interfere with the
                       security functionality provided by the IC hardware platform.


               1.3.2   Usage and major security functionality of the P6022P VB/P6022X VB
                       The P6022P VB/P6022X VB is composed of the IC hardware platform of NXP Secure
                       Smart Card Controller P6022P VB/P6022X VB, the IC Dedicated Software, and the
                       documentation describing the Instruction Set and the usage. The P6022P VB/P6022X VB
                       is delivered with a customer specific Security IC Embedded Software.
                       The IC hardware platform of NXP Secure Smart Card Controller P6022P VB/P6022X VB
                       is a microcontroller incorporating a central processing unit, memories accessible via a
                       Memory Management Unt,c iryptographic coprocessors, other security components and
                       two communication interfaces. The central processing unit supports a 32-/24-/16-/8-bit
                       instruction set optimized for smart card applications, which is a super set of the 80C51
                       family instruction set. The first and in some cases the second byte of an instruction are
                       used for operation encoding. On-chip memories are ROM, RAM and EEPROM. The non-
                       volatile EEPROM can be used as data or program memory. It consists of high reliable
                       memory cells, which guarantee data integrity. The EEPROM is optimized for applications


                          * MIFARE emulations are not part of the TSF and do not implement any Security Functional Requirement.
                            The evaluation scope of the MIFARE emulations are limited to not interfere with the functionality provided
                            by the IC hardware platform.

                      requiring reliable non-volatile data storage for data and program code. Dedicated security
                      functionality protects the contents of all memories.
                      The IC Dedicated Software for NXP Secure Smart Card Controller P6022P VB/P6022X
                      VB comprises IC Dedicated Test Software for test purposes and IC Dedicated Support
                      Software. The IC Dedicated Support Software consists of Boot-ROM Software which
                      controls the boot process of the hardware platform and Plain Firmware Operating System
                      (FOS-Plain) which can be called by the Security IC Embedded Software. The FOS-
                      Plain provides an interface for programming of the internal EEPROM memory, which
                      is mandatory for use by the Security IC Embedded Software when programming the
                      EEPROM memory. Also, the FOS-Plain provides an interface for the Post Delivery
                      Configuration functionality.
                      The documentation includes a Product Data Sheet, an Instruction Set, a Guidance
                      and Operation Manual, two Wafer and delivery specifications (according to Fab) and
                      a Firmware Interface Specification Product data sheet addendum. This documentation
                      comprises a description of the architecture, the secure configuration and usage of the
                      IC hardware platform and the IC Dedicated Software by the Security IC Embedded
                      Software.
                      The security functionality of the P6022P VB/P6022X VB is designed to act as an integral
                      part of a complete security system in order to strengthen the design as a whole. Several
                      security mechanisms are completely implemented in and controlled by the P6022P VB/
                      P6022X VB. Other security mechanisms allow for configuration or even require handling
                      of exceptions by the Security IC Embedded Software. The different CPU modes and the
                      Memory Management Unit support the implementation of multi-application projects using
                      the P6022P VB/P6022X VB.
                      A Security IC must provide high security in particular when being used in the banking
                      and finance market, in electronic commerce or in governmental applications because
                      the P6022P VB/P6022X VB is intended to be used in a potential insecure environment.
                      Hence the P6022P VB/P6022X VB shall maintain
                      • the integrity and the confidentiality of code and data stored in its memories,
                      • the different CPU modes with the related capabilities for configuration and memory
                        access and
                      • the integrity, the correct operation and the confidentiality of security functionality
                        provided by the P6022P VB/P6022X VB.
                      This is ensured by the construction of the P6022P VB/P6022X VB and its security
                      functionality.
                      NXP Secure Smart Card Controller P6022P VB/P6022X VB basically provides a
                      hardware platform for an implementation of a smart card application with
                      • functionality to calculate the Data Encryption Standard (Triple-DES) with up to three

                 1.2 TOE Overview
                      The TOE consists of the Micro Controller and a software stack which is stored on the
                      Micro Controller and which can be executed by the Micro Controller. The software stack
                      can be further split into the following components:
                      • Firmware for booting and low level functionality of the Micro Controller (MC FW)
                        like writing to flash memory. This includes software for implementing cryptographic
                        operations, called Crypto Library.
                      • Software for implementing a Java Card Virtual Machine [15], a Java Card Runtime
                        Environment [16] and a Java Card Application Programming Interface [14], called
                        JCVM, JCRE and JCAPI.
                      • Software for implementing content management according to GlobalPlatform [17],
                        called GlobalPlatform (GP) Framework.
                      • Software for executing native libraries, called Secure Box.
                      The TOE is referred to as JCOP 4.7 SE051. The JCOP 4 Operating System (JCOP 4
                      OS) consists of the software stack without the Crypto Library (Crypto Lib) and without
                      the Micro Controller Firmware (MC FW). The TOE uses one or more communication
                      interfaces to communicate with its environment.
                      The complete TOE is depicted in Figure 1. The elements are described in more detail in
                      Section 1.3 "TOE Description".

                               Figure 1 shows the components of the TOE. The TOE is a composite product on top
                               of CC certified Hardware, Firmware and Crypto Library. Part of the TOE are the JCVM,
                               JCRE, JCAPI and the GP Framework. Also included is optional functionality and the
                               Secure Box mechanism. The Secure Box Native Librarys provide native functions for
                               untrusted third parties and are not part of the TOE.
                               The figure shows Java Card applets which are small programs in Java language that can
                               be executed by the TOE, but are not part of the TOE.

                     1.2.1 Usage and Major Security Features of the TOE
                               The usage of the TOE is focused on security critical applications in small form factors.
                               One main usage scenario is the use of so called smart cards. Examples of such cards
                               are banking cards or electronic drivers’ licenses. The TOE can also be used in an
                               electronic passport. Another usage scenario is device authentication, where the TOE can
                               be used to prove the authenticity or originality of a device like an accessory for a gaming
                               console.
                               The TOE provides a variety of security features. The hardware of the Micro Controller
                               already protects against logical and physical attacks by applying various sensors to
                               detect manipulations and by processing data in ways which protect against leakage
                               of data by side channel analysis. With the software stack the TOE provides many

                      In addition, several security mechanisms are implemented to ensure proper operation
                      as well as integrity and confidentiality of stored data. For example, this includes security
                      mechanisms for memory protection and security exceptions as well as sensors, which
                      allow operation under specified conditions only. Memory encryption is used for memory
                      protection and chip shielding is added to the chip.

                      Note: Large integer arithmetic operations are intended to be used for calculation of
                      asymmetric cryptographic algorithms. Any asymmetric cryptographic algorithm utilizing
                      the support for large integer arithmetic operations has to be implemented in the Security
                      IC Embedded Software. Thus, the support for large integer arithmetic operations itself
                      does not provide security functionality like cryptographic support. The Security IC
                      Embedded Software implementing an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm is not included
                      in this evaluation. Nevertheless the support for large integer arithmetic operations is
                      part of the Security IC and therefore a security relevant component of the P6022P VB/
                      P6022X VB, that must resist to the attacks mentioned in this Security Target and that
                      must operate correctly as specified in the data sheet. The same scope of evaluation is
                      applied to the CRC calculation.


               1.3.3 Usage and major security functionality of the P6022M VB/P6022D VB/
                     P6022J VB
                      The P6022M VB/P6022D VB/P6022J VB variants provide the all security functionality as
                      the afore mentioned P6022P VB/P6022X VB variants.
                      In addition to P6022P VB/P6022X VB, NXP Secure Smart Card Controller P6022M
                      VB/P6022D VB/P6022J VB includes Emulation MIFARE Plus MF1PLUSx0 or MIFARE
                      DESFire EV1 or both MIFARE Plus MF1PLUSx0 and MIFARE DESFire EV1 in the
                      FOS-Emu and is, therefore, part of the TOE. Note that MIFARE Plus MF1PLUSx0 and
                      MIFARE DESFire EV1 are represented by the term MIFARE Software in this document.
                      The MIFARE Software provides a set of functions used to manage the data stored in the
                      non-volatile EEPROM memory owned by MIFARE Software respectively.
                      Note that the Firmware Operating System (FOS) for the hardware platform is called the
                      Plain Firmware Operating System (FOS-Plain) and the Firmware Operating System for
                      the MIFARE Software Emulation is called the Emulation Firmware Operating System
                      (FOS-Emu).
                      The documentation includes a Product Data Sheet, an Instruction Set, a Guidance
                      and Operation Manual, two Wafer and delivery specification (according to Fab) and
                      a Firmware Interface Specification Product data sheet addendum. For the TOE
                      with MIFARE Software, the documentation additionally includes a Functionality of
                      implementation of MIFARE Software and a Guidance, Delivery and Operation Manual
                      of MIFARE Software. This documentation comprises a description of the architecture,
                      the secure configuration and usage of the IC hardware platform and the IC Dedicated
                      Software by the Security IC Embedded Software.
                      MIFARE functionality does not implement any Security Functional Requirement and its
                      functionality is therefore not in the scope of the evaluation and does not interfere with the
                      security functionality provided by the IC hardware platform.


               1.3.4 TOE Type
                      The TOE NXP Secure Smart Card Controller P6022y VB is provided as IC hardware

                        3. Time representation and counter functionality .

                 1.2.2 TOE Type
                      The TOE is a Java Card with a GP Framework. It can be used to load and execute off-
                      card verified Java Card applets.

                 1.2.3 Required non-TOE Hardware/Software/Firmware
                      Three groups of users shall be distinguished here.
                      The first group is the end-users group, which uses the TOE with one or more loaded
                      applets in the final form factor like a banking card or an electronic passport. These users
                      only require a communication device to be able to communicate with the TOE. The
                      communication protocol of the TOE is standardized in either ISO7816 [31] (T=1, T=0),
                      ISO14443 [32] (T=CL), or UM10204 [33] (I2C Slave).
                      The second group of users are administrators of cards. They want to configure the
                      card by using the Configuration Module, to install additional applets and to configure and
                      personalise these applets. These users require the same equipment as end-users.
                      The third group of users wants to develop Java Card applets and execute them on
                      the TOE. These applet developers need in addition to the communication device a
                      set of tools for the development of applets. This set of tools can be obtained from the
                      TOE vendor and comprises elements such as PC development environment, byte code
                      verifier, compiler, linker and debugger.

                     1.3 TOE Description

                    1.3.1 TOE Components and Composite Certification
                           The certification of this TOE is a composite certification. The following sections provide
                           a more detailed description of the components of Figure 1. It is also made clear whether
                           a component is covered by a previous certification or whether it is covered in the
                           certification of this TOE.

                  1.3.1.1 Micro Controller

                           The Micro Controller is a secure smart card controller from NXP’s SmartMX3 family.
                           The Micro Controller contains a co-processor for symmetric cryptographic operations,
                           supporting DES and AES, as well as an accelerator for asymmetric cryptographic
                           algorithms. The Micro Controller further contains a physical random number generator.
                           The supported memory technologies are volatile (Random Access Memory (RAM)) and
                           non-volatile (Read Only Memory (ROM) and FLASH) memory.
                           Access to all memory types is controlled by a Memory Management Unit (MMU) which
                           allows to separate and restrict access to parts of the memory.
                           The Micro Controller has been certified in a previous certification and the results are re-
                           used for this certification. The exact reference to the previous certification is given in the
                           following Table 2 "Reference to Certified Micro Controller":

                                                                          [1]

                           [1]   The SE051 hardware is an instantiation of the N7121 hard macro with I2C side-car.


                  1.3.1.2 Security IC Dedicated Software

                 1.3.1.2.1 MC FW (Micro Controller Firmware)

                           The Micro Controller Firmware is used for testing of the Micro Controller at production,
                           for booting of the Micro Controller after power-up or after reset, for configuration of
                           communication devices and for writing data to volatile and non-volatile memory.
                           The MC FW has been certified together with the Micro Controller and the same reference
                           [10] as given for the Micro Controller also apply for the MC FW.

                 1.3.1.2.2 Crypto Library

                           The Crypto Library provides implementations for symmetric and asymmetric
                           cryptographic operations, hashing, the generation of hybrid deterministic and hybrid
                           physical random numbers and further functions like secure copy and compare.
                           Some of the cryptographic algorithms offered by the Crypto Lib are not certified, see
                           Section 1.3.1.4 "Excluded functionality".
                           The symmetric cryptographic operations comprise the algorithms 3DES and AES. These
                           algorithms use the symmetric co-processor of the Micro Controller.

                          The supported asymmetric cryptographic operations are ECC and RSA. These
                          algorithms use the Public Key Crypto Coprocessor (PKCC) of the Micro Controller for the
                          cryptographic operations.
                          The Crypto Library has been certified together with the Micro Controller and the same

                 1.3.1.3.1 JCOP 4.7 SE051

                          The OS of the TOE consists of JCVM, JCRE, JCAPI and GP framework. It is
                          implemented according to the Java Card Specification and GlobalPlatform. Additionally it
                          consists of a proprietary API, which is described in the UGM [9].
                          The TOE can be identified by using the IDENTIFY APDU command (see UGM [9]). This
                          command returns the card identification data, which includes a Platform ID, a Patch ID
                          and other information that allows to identify the content in ROM, FLASH and loaded
                          patches (if any).
                          The TOE also includes a Configuration Module (see Section 1.3.2 "Optional TOE
                          Functionality") which is used for personalisation and configuration of the TOE. It must be
                          deleted after the personalisation is finished (end of Phase 6 ”Personalisation”) by using
                          the DELETE APDU command. Once the Configuration Module is deleted, it is no longer
                          possible to configure the TOE.

 Figure 1. Components of the TOE

                               Figure 1 shows the components of the TOE. The TOE is a composite product on top
                               of CC certified Hardware, Firmware and Crypto Library. Part of the TOE are the JCVM,
                               JCRE, JCAPI and the GP Framework. Also included is optional functionality and the
                               Secure Box mechanism. The Secure Box Native Librarys provide native functions for
                               untrusted third parties and are not part of the TOE.
                               The figure shows Java Card applets which are small programs in Java language that can
                               be executed by the TOE, but are not part of the TOE.

                     1.2.1 Usage and Major Security Features of the TOE
                               The usage of the TOE is focused on security critical applications in small form factors.
                               One main usage scenario is the use of so called smart cards. Examples of such cards
                               are banking cards or electronic drivers’ licenses. The TOE can also be used in an
                               electronic passport. Another usage scenario is device authentication, where the TOE can
                               be used to prove the authenticity or originality of a device like an accessory for a gaming
                               console.
                               The TOE provides a variety of security features. The hardware of the Micro Controller
                               already protects against logical and physical attacks by applying various sensors to
                               detect manipulations and by processing data in ways which protect against leakage
                               of data by side channel analysis. With the software stack the TOE provides many

                           – Asserting results of sensitive functions.
                                                                         2
                        3. Time representation and counter functionality .

                 1.2.2 TOE Type
                      The TOE is a Java Card with a GP Framework. It can be used to load and execute off-
                      card verified Java Card applets.

                 1.2.3 Required non-TOE Hardware/Software/Firmware
                      Three groups of users shall be distinguished here.
                      The first group is the end-users group, which uses the TOE with one or more loaded
                      applets in the final form factor like a banking card or an electronic passport. These users
                      only require a communication device to be able to communicate with the TOE. The
                      communication protocol of the TOE is standardized in either ISO7816 [31] (T=1, T=0),
                      ISO14443 [32] (T=CL), or UM10204 [33] (I2C Slave).
                      The second group of users are administrators of cards. They want to configure the
                      card by using the Configuration Module, to install additional applets and to configure and
                      personalise these applets. These users require the same equipment as end-users.
                      The third group of users wants to develop Java Card applets and execute them on
                      the TOE. These applet developers need in addition to the communication device a
                      set of tools for the development of applets. This set of tools can be obtained from the
                      TOE vendor and comprises elements such as PC development environment, byte code
                      verifier, compiler, linker and debugger.

                     1.3 TOE Description

                    1.3.1 TOE Components and Composite Certification
                           The certification of this TOE is a composite certification. The following sections provide
                           a more detailed description of the components of Figure 1. It is also made clear whether
                           a component is covered by a previous certification or whether it is covered in the
                           certification of this TOE.

                  1.3.1.1 Micro Controller

                           The Micro Controller is a secure smart card controller from NXP’s SmartMX3 family.
                           The Micro Controller contains a co-processor for symmetric cryptographic operations,
                           supporting DES and AES, as well as an accelerator for asymmetric cryptographic
                           algorithms. The Micro Controller further contains a physical random number generator.
                           The supported memory technologies are volatile (Random Access Memory (RAM)) and
                           non-volatile (Read Only Memory (ROM) and FLASH) memory.
                           Access to all memory types is controlled by a Memory Management Unit (MMU) which
                           allows to separate and restrict access to parts of the memory.
                           The Micro Controller has been certified in a previous certification and the results are re-
                           used for this certification. The exact reference to the previous certification is given in the
                           following Table 2 "Reference to Certified Micro Controller":

                           Table 2. Reference to Certified Micro Controller

                                                                          [1]

                           [1]   The SE051 hardware is an instantiation of the N7121 hard macro with I2C side-car.


                  1.3.1.2 Security IC Dedicated Software

                 1.3.1.2.1 MC FW (Micro Controller Firmware)

                           The Micro Controller Firmware is used for testing of the Micro Controller at production,
                           for booting of the Micro Controller after power-up or after reset, for configuration of
                           communication devices and for writing data to volatile and non-volatile memory.
                           The MC FW has been certified together with the Micro Controller and the same reference
                           [10] as given for the Micro Controller also apply for the MC FW.

                 1.3.1.2.2 Crypto Library

                           The Crypto Library provides implementations for symmetric and asymmetric
                           cryptographic operations, hashing, the generation of hybrid deterministic and hybrid
                           physical random numbers and further functions like secure copy and compare.
                           Some of the cryptographic algorithms offered by the Crypto Lib are not certified, see
                           Section 1.3.1.4 "Excluded functionality".
                           The symmetric cryptographic operations comprise the algorithms 3DES and AES. These
                           algorithms use the symmetric co-processor of the Micro Controller.

                          The supported asymmetric cryptographic operations are ECC and RSA. These
                          algorithms use the Public Key Crypto Coprocessor (PKCC) of the Micro Controller for the
                          cryptographic operations.
                          The Crypto Library has been certified together with the Micro Controller and the same

                 1.3.1.3.1 JCOP 4.7 SE051

                          The OS of the TOE consists of JCVM, JCRE, JCAPI and GP framework. It is
                          implemented according to the Java Card Specification and GlobalPlatform. Additionally it
                          consists of a proprietary API, which is described in the UGM [9].
                          The TOE can be identified by using the IDENTIFY APDU command (see UGM [9]). This
                          command returns the card identification data, which includes a Platform ID, a Patch ID
                          and other information that allows to identify the content in ROM, FLASH and loaded
                          patches (if any).
                          The TOE also includes a Configuration Module (see Section 1.3.2 "Optional TOE
                          Functionality") which is used for personalisation and configuration of the TOE. It must be
                          deleted after the personalisation is finished (end of Phase 6 ”Personalisation”) by using
                          the DELETE APDU command. Once the Configuration Module is deleted, it is no longer
                          possible to configure the TOE.
                          The TOE contains further functionality for integrity protection of user data via an
                          EDC, encryption of user data via PUF [12] and optional functionality as described in
                          Section 1.3.2 "Optional TOE Functionality".

                  1.3.1.4 Excluded functionality

                          All Secure Box Native Libraries are not part of the TOE. No security functional
                          requirements are claimed on AES CCM, HMAC, HKDF, ECDAA, elliptic curve
                          cryptography based on Edwards and Montgomery curves and FIPS self-tests, they are
                          TSF non-interfering.

manently unusable ends the life of the TOE as SSCD.
The TOE may support functions to generate additional signing keys. If the TOE supports these functions it
will support further functions to securely obtain certificates for the new keys. For an additional key the
signatory may be allowed to choose the kind of certificate (qualified, or not) to obtain for the SVD of the
new key. The signatory may also be allowed to choose some of the data in the certificate request for in-
stance to use a pseudonym instead of the legal name in the certificate5. If the conditions to obtain a quali-
fied certificate are met, the new key can also be used to create advanced electronic signatures. The optional
TOE functions for additional key generation and certification may require additional security functions in
the TOE and an interaction with the SSCD-provisioning service provider in an environment that is secure.
The TOE life cycle as SSCD ends when all SCD stored in the TOE are destructed. This may include deletion of
the corresponding certificates.

for optimized contactless communication. The ROM and SOLID FLASH™ NVM areas storing the RFAPI functions
are access protected and only the SOLID FLASH™ NVM part, which is not part of the TOE, implements the user
interface. The RFAPI is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

This TOE implements a Hybrid Random Number Generator (HRNG). This HRNG equals to the expression Hybrid
Physical True Random Number Generator (hybrid PTRNG) as defined by the BSI. In the following, the BSI
expression hybrid PTRNG is used. The hybrid PTRNG implements a true physical random source and has
evidenced its conformance to the classes of AIS31 [13] as declared in chapter 7.1.1.1.
The produced genuine random numbers are available as a security service for the user and are also used for
internal purposes. Together with the guidelines in [6] the hybrid PTRNG operates in the following modes of
operation and is conformant to the named classes:
     True Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.2
     Hybrid Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.3
     Deterministic Random Number Generation (DRNG) AIS31 DRG.3
     Key Stream Generation (KSG), stream cipher generation AIS31 DRG.2
The hybrid PTRNG is deemed for any application requiring excellent physical random data entropy.

The two cryptographic coprocessors serve the need of modern cryptography:
    The symmetric co-processor (SCP) combines both AES and DES with one, two or triple-key hardware
       acceleration. Please note that the single DES algorithm is not in the scope of evaluation due to national
       regulation by BSI.
    And, the Asymmetric Crypto Co-processor, called Crypto@2304T, provides optimized high performance
       calculations for the user software executing cryptographic operations and is also used by the optional
       cryptographic libraries for Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and Elliptic Curve (EC) cryptography.

The optional software parts are differentiated into following libraries:
    The asymmetric cryptographic libraries (ACL) in following alternative versions:
       v2.08.007, v2.07.003 and v2.06.003.
           o All ACL libraries provide RSA1 2048/4096 cryptography.
                The library supports also smaller key lengths, but the certification follows the national regulation
                by the BSI2.
           o All ACL libraries provide elliptic curve cryptography EC3
    the Toolbox library in the versions v2.08.007, v2.07.003 and v2.06.003 provides basic mathematical
       functions for a simplified user interface to the Crypto@2304T. The Toolbox library is not part of the TOE
       Security Functionality (TSF).
    the symmetric cryptographic libraries (SCL) in the improved and enhanced version v2.04.002 and the
       version v2.02.010 provide simplified interfaces and utilize the full services of the SCP to the user
    the hardware support library (HSL) in the versions 01.22.4346 and 02.01.6634 provides a simplified
       interface and utilizes the full services of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM to the user
    the hardware support library (HSL) in the versions 03.11.8339 and 03.12.8812 provide equal to the above
       a simplified interface, utilizes the full services of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM to the user, and enables the

       the CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CIPURSE™ CL and CCL) in the version v02.00.0004 provides the
        user OSPT alliance CIPURSE™ V2 conformant communication functionality between a PICC and a PCD
       the NRG Software. The NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

The RSA cryptographic library, regardless of the version chosen:
     provides a high level interface to the hardware component Crypto2304T and includes countermeasures
        against fault injection and side channel attacks.
     implements the generation of RSA Key Pairs (RsaKeyGen), the RSA signature verification (RsaVerify),
        the RSA signature generation (RsaSign) and the RSA modulus recalculation (RsaModulus). This RSA
        library can perform RSA operations from 512 to 4096 bits.
     implements the high level interface to hardware cryptographic coprocessor Crypto2304T which runs the
        basic long number calculations (add, subtract, multiply, square) with high performance.
The RSA library is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software.
Following the national BSI recommendations, RSA key lengths below 1976 bits are not included in the certificate.
Please note that the BSI expects this key length as appropriate until 2022 and recommends for longer usage
times key lengths of 3000 bits or higher.

The EC library, regardless of the version chosen:
     provides a high level interface to Elliptic Curve Cryptography computed on the hardware component
        Crypto2304T and includes countermeasures against fault injection and side channel attacks.
     implements routines for ECDSA signature generation, for ECDSA signature verification, ECDSA key
        generation and for the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement.
     In addition, the EC library provides an additional function for calculating primitive elliptic curve
        operations like ECC Add and ECC Double.
     EC curves over prime field Fp, as well as over GF(2n) finite field are supported too.
The EC library is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software.
The security functional requirement covers the standard Brainpool [19] and NIST [26] Elliptic Curves with key
lengths of 160, 163, 192, 224, 233, 256, 283, 320, 384, 409, 512 or 521 bits.
The definition of the key lengths follows the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100 bit security level by the
BSI.
Numerous other curve types, being also secure in terms of side channel attacks on this TOE, exist, which the user
optionally can add in the composition certification process.

If the user decides not to use any of the offered cryptographic library(s), regardless of the version, none of the
cryptographic libraries is consequently delivered and the accompanying Additional Specific Security
Functionality (O.Add-Functions) Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and/ or EC is/are not provided by the TOE. Else it
depends of the chosen library whether the Additional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions) Rivest-
Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and/ or EC is/are supported.

The Toolbox library, regardless of the version chosen, does not provide cryptographic support or additional
security functionality as it provides only the following basic long integer arithmetic and modular functions in
software, supported by the cryptographic coprocessor: Addition, subtraction, division, multiplication,
comparison, reduction, modular addition, modular subtraction, modular multiplication, modular inversion and
modular exponentiation. No security relevant policy, mechanism or function is supported. The Toolbox library is
deemed for software developers as support for simplified implementation of long integer and modular
arithmetic operations. The Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

The symmetric cryptographic library SCL offers a high level interface to perform the cryptographic operations
DES, TDES and AES with different key lengths on the symmetric cryptographic coprocessor (SCP) for this TOE.

In addition, the SCL implements MAC computation of a CMAC, using AES and 3DES algorithms, respectively a
RetailMAC using the DES algorithm.
The SCL implements already several block cipher modes as declared in this document and covers a wide range of
applications, but the SCL offers in addition the flexibility to implement additional user defined block cipher
modes.
Both library versions provide a simplified interface to the hardware Symmetric Cryptographic Coprocessor (SCP)
and preserve the security and performance requirements as required by the user.
Even in the basic configuration the SCL meets the tarlse it depends of the chosen library whether the Additional Specific Security Functionality
(O.Add-Functions) Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and/ or EC is/are supported.

The Toolbox library, regardless of the version chosen, provides the user optionally basic arithmetic and modular
arithmetic operations, in order to support user software development using long integer operations. These basic
arithmetic operations do not provide security functionality, implement no security mechanism, and do not
proved additional specific security functionality – as defined for the cryptographic libraries.
The user developed software using the Toolbox basic operations is not part of the TOE.
The Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

The symmetric cryptographic library SCL – in both versions – offers a high level interface to perform the
cryptographic operations DES, TDES and AES with different key lengths on the symmetric cryptographic
coprocessor (SCP) for this TOE. In addition, the SCL in version v2.04.002 implements computation of a CMAC
using AES and 3DES algorithms.

Public Security Target
Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)


The SCL implements already several bgeted security level, which can be further increased by
simple means of configuration options.
The key lengths used for the AES and DES functionality follow the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100
bit security level issued by the BSI1. This regulation excludes the single DES operation from the certification as it
is considered to be not sufficiently secure from algorithm perspective.
For both versions, the certification covers the SCL cryptographic functionality of the AES algorithm with key
lengths of 128, 192, 256 bits and the TDEA or TripleDES (TDES) algorithm with an effective key size of 112 and
168 bits. For the version v2.04.002 the certification covers the CMAC functionality too.

Note that this TOE can come with both cryptographic co-processors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a
blocked Crypto2304T, or with both cryptographic co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the user’s
choice. No accessibility of the deselected cryptographic co-processors is without impact on any other security
policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the situation where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic
co-processors.

Beside the inclusion and support of cryptographic libraries this TOE comes with the optional Hardware Support
Library (HSL) in different alternative versions, significantly simplifying the management of the SOLID FLASH™
NVM functionality. The HSL constitutes an application interface (API) accessing the HSL state machine and
abstracting low level properties like special function registers and settings of specific hardware features. In short
the HSL provides a user friendly also use case oriented interface considering endurance, reliability and
performance. In certain configurations the HSL provides also functions implementing tearing safe behaviour of
the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. If used the user has no need to care about cases where the TOE is suddenly cut off the
power supply even during managing the SOLID FLASH™ NVM.
Anyhow, the HSL remains as an optional library as even sudden power off situations does never lead to
exploitable conditions of the TOE. In the worse the TOE ends operation in case of a faulty programmed SOLID
FLASH™ NVM location due to the Integrity Guard.
In addition to the above, the HSL in version 03.12.8812 and 03.11.8339 provide an advanced additional method
called Incremental Write (IWR). This method provides enhanced endurance of the SOLID FLASH NVM even
beyond the erase endurance limits for often written objects. Thus this method serves applications with a demand
for high endurance and fast writing times. On the other hand, the read times using this method are slower than
the other methods provided.

The order option CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CIPURSE™ CL) provides cryptographic functionality to
implement a CIPURSE™ V2 conformant protocol.
This protocol provides a secure mutual authentication of two entities, namely the terminal (denoted as PCD =
Proximity Coupling Device (CIPURSE™-compliant terminal)) and a smart card or a token in other form factors
which is called PICC. PICC stands for Proximity Integrated Circuit Card (CIPURSE™-compliant card).
Beside the mutual authentication, the protocol implements measures to maintain the integrity of the transferred
data and preserves in parallel the confidentiality of the transferred data.
By that the CIPURSE™ CL supports the user to implement systems conformant to the CIPURSE™ open standard
implementing a secured, interoperable and flexible transit fare collection solution, including ISO 7816, ISO/IEC
14443-4 communication and AES-128 bit cryptography for multiple payment types.

Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)


By that the CIPURSE™ CL supports the user to implement systems conformant to the CIPURSE™ open standard
implementing a secured, interoperable and flexible transit fare collection solution, including ISO 7816, ISO/IEC
14443-4 communication and AES-128 bit cryptography for multiple payment types.
The order option of the CIPURSE™ CL is conformant to the CIPURSE™ open standard [18] for both, the PICC and
then PCD software parts. It implements the by the OSPT alliance standardized application interface for the card
and the terminal side.
The scope of this certification of this TOE covers all parts of the CIPURSE™ CL which are later implemented by
the user on the user card respectively token based on this TOE and the functionality of the PCD software part
which is implemented in the terminal side. The PCD software operates also on the hardware of this TOE which is
implemented in the terminal.
The CIPURSE™ CL implements the by the OSPT alliance standardized application interface for the card and the
terminal side.

The NRG Software is a further order option and implements the routines for a NRG interface. The NRG
implements an operating system handling the emulation of an NRG card together with the RF interface. One
part of the NRG is permanently stored in the ROM and the second part consisting of patch and API is located in
the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The second part is only present if the NRG is part of the delivery. If the NRG is not part
of the delivery the ROM part is present but not used. The NRG implements tearing safe behaviour in context with
the SOLID FLASH™ NVM management and is therefore independent from the HSL. The NRG is not part of the
TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

To fulfill the highest security requirements for smartcards today and also in the future, this TOE implements a
progressive digital security concept, which already has been certified in various forerunner processes. This TOE
utilizes digital security features to include customer friendly security, combined with a robust design overcoming
the disadvantages on analogue protection technologies. The TOE provides full on-chip encryption covering the
complete core, busses, memories and cryptographic co-processors leaving no plain data on the chip. A further
security feature has been implemented for this TOE protecting also the involved addresses transferred over the
memory bus. Therefore the attractiveness for attackers is a step further extremely reduced as encrypted signals
are of no use for the attacker – neither for manipulation nor for eavesdropping.
In addition, the TOE is equipped with a comprehensive error detection capability for the complete data path. The
dual CPU approach allows error detection even while processing. A comparator detects whether a calculation
was performed without errors. This approach does not leave any parts of the core circuitry unprotected. The
concept allows that the relevant attack scenarios are detected, whereas other conditions that would not lead to
an error would mainly be ignored. That renders the TOE robust against environmental influences.
Furthermore, the TOE implements what we call intelligent implicit shielding (I2). These measures constitute a
shield on sensitive and security critical signals which is not recognizable or obvious as a shield. This provides
excellent protection against invasive physical attacks, such as probing, forcing or similar.
In this Security Target the TOE is briefly described and a summary specification is given. The security
environment of the TOE durlock cipher modes as declared in this document and covering a wide range
of applications, the SCL offers in addition the flexibility to implement additional block cipher modes defined by
the user.
This library provides a simplified interface to the hardware Symmetric Cryptographic Coprocessor (SCP) and
preserves the security and performance requirements as required by the user.
Note that the definition of the key lengths follows the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100 bit security
level by the BSI. This excludes the single DES operation from the certification.

Beside the inclusion and support of cryptographic libraries this TOE comes with the optional Hardware Support
Library (HSL) in different versions significantly simplifying the management of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM
functionality. The HSL constitutes an application interface (API) accessing the HSL state machine and
abstracting low level properties like special function registers and settings of specific hardware features. In short
the HSL provides a user friendly also useing its different phases of the lifecycle is defined. The assets are identified which
have to be protected through the security policy. The threats against these assets are described. The security
objectives and the security policy are defined, as well as the security requirements. These security requirements
are built out of the security functional requirements as part of the security policy and the security assurance
requirements. These are the formal steps applied during the evaluation and certification showing that the TOE
meets the targeted requirements. In additi case oriented interface considering endurance, reliability and
performance requirements.
In certain configurations each of the HSL versions provide also functions implementing tearing safe behavon, simplified functionality of the TOE matching the requirements is
described.
