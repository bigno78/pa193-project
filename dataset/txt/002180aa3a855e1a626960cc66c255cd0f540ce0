 [22] FMT_SMR.1 for BAC
FMT_MTD.1.1/INI_ENA The TSF shall restrict the ability to write the Initialisation Data and Pre-personalisation
                    Data to the Manufacturer.
Application Note: The application note 42 of [PP_BAC] applies. This application note provides a definition, what
is meant by “Pre-personalization Data”. This definition is also applicable to FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA from
[PP_SAC]. Therefore FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be combined.

Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)

6.2.3              Class FPT Protection of the Security Functions
FPT_TST.1               TSF testing
Hierarchical to:        No other components.
Dependencies:           No dependencies.
FPT_TST.1.1             The TSF shall run a suite of self tests during initial start-up, to demonstrate the correct
                        operation of the TSF.
FPT_TST.1.2             The TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to verify the integrity of the
                        TSF data.
FPT_TST.1.3             The TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to verify the integrity of
                        stored TSF executable code.
Application Note: There is no contradiction between application note 46 of [PP_BAC] and application note 52 of
[PP_SAC]. In fact, although the wording is slightly different, the meaning of these application notes is identical.
Therefore either of these application notes applies and FPT_TST.1 from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be
combined.


FPT_PHP.3               Resistance to physical attack
Hierarchical to:        No other components.
Dependencies:           No dependencies.
FPT_PHP.3.1             The TSF shall resist physical manipulation and physical probing to the TSF by
                        responding automatically such that the SFRs are always enforced.
Application Note: Application note 47 of [PP_BAC] and 53 of [PP_SAC] are equivalent. Application note 48 of
[PP_BAC] is only informative to the reader in the sense, that it provides a context to an older CC standard, but
not relevant for the interpretation of FPT_PHP.3. Therefore either application note 47 of [PP_BAC] or
application note 53 of [PP_SAC] applies and FPT_PHP.3 from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be combined.


6.3                SFRs specifically from [PP_SAC]

6.3.1              Class FCS: Cryptographic Support
FCS_CKM.1/DH_PACE Cryptographic key generation – Diffie-Hellman for PACE session keys
Hierarchical to:        No other components.
Dependencies:           [FCS_CKM.1 Cryptographic key distribution or FCS_COP.1 Cryptographic operation]
                        Justification: A Diffie-Hellman key agreement is used in order to have no key
                        distribution, therefore FCS_CKM.2 makes no sense in this case. FCS_CKM.4
                        Cryptographic key destruction: fulfilled by FCS_CKM.4
FCS_CKM.1.1/DH_PACE       The TSF shall generate cryptographic keys in accordance with a specified
                   cryptographic key generation algorithm Diffie-Hellman-Protocol compliant to
                   [PKCS#3], ECDH compliant to [TR_ECC] and specified cryptographic key size Table 6
