                                                                                                                      Security Target Lite



                       The IC hardware platform P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF is a microcontroller
                       incorporating a central processing unit, memories accessible via a Memory Management
                       Unit, cryptographic coprocessors, other security components and two communication
                       interfaces. The central processing unit supports a 32-/24-/16-/8-bit instruction set optimized
                       for smart card applications, which is a super set of the 80C51 family instruction set. The first
                       and in some cases the second byte of an instruction are used for operation encoding. On-
                       chip memories are ROM, RAM and EEPROM. The non-volatile EEPROM can be used as
                       data or program memory. It consists of high reliable memory cells, which guarantee data
                       integrity. The EEPROM is optimized for applications requiring reliable non-volatile data
                       storage for data and program code. EEPROM double read function is included for correct
                       memory readout. Dedicated security functionality protects the contents of all memories.
                       The security functionality of the TOE is designed to act as an integral part of a complete
                       security system in order to strengthen the design as a whole. Several security mechanisms
                       are completely implemented in and controlled by the TOE. Other security mechanisms allow
                       for configuration or even require handling of exceptions by the Security IC Embedded
                       Software. The different CPU modes and the Memory Management Unit support the
                       implementation of multi-application projects using the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF.
                       A Security IC must provide high security in particular when being used in the banking and
                       finance market, in electronic commerce or in governmental applications because the TOE
                       is intended to be used in a potential insecure environment. Hence the TOE shall maintain
                           • the integrity and the confidentiality of code and data stored in its memories and
                           • the different CPU modes with the related capabilities for configuration and memory
                             access and
                           • the integrity, the correct operation and the confidentiality of security functionality
                             provided by the TOE.
                       This is ensured by the construction of the TOE and its security functionality.
                       P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF basically provides a hardware platform for an
                       implementation of a smart card application with
                           • functionality to calculate the Data Encryption Standard (Triple-DES) with up to three
                             keys,
                           • functionality to calculate the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with different key
                             lengths,
                           • support for large integer arithmetic operations like multiplication, addition and logical
                             operations, which are suitable for public key cryptography and elliptic curve
                             cryptography,
                           • a True Random Number Generator,
                           • memory management control,
                           • cyclic redundancy check (CRC) calculation,
                           • ISO/IEC 7816 contact interface with UART,
                           • ISO/IEC 14443 A contactless interface.
                       In addition, several security mechanisms are implemented to ensure proper operation as
                       well as integrity and confidentiality of stored data. For example, this includes security
                       mechanisms for memory protection and security exceptions as well as sensors, which allow

                       and chip shielding is added to the chip.
                       Note:        Large integer arithmetic operations are intended to be used for calculation of
                                    asymmetric cryptographic algorithms. Any asymmetric cryptographic
                                    algorithm utilizing the support for large integer arithmetic operations has to be
                                    implemented in the Security IC Embedded Software. Thus, the support for
                                    large integer arithmetic operations itself does not provide security functionality
                                    like cryptographic support. The Security IC Embedded Software implementing
                                    an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm is not included in this evaluation.
                                    Nevertheless the support for large integer arithmetic operations is part of the
                                    Security IC and therefore a security relevant component of the TOE, that must
                                    resist to the attacks mentioned in this Security Target and that must operate
                                    correctly as specified in the data sheet. The same scope of evaluation is
                                    applied to the CRC calculation.


                  1.3.2 TOE type
                       The P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF is provided as IC hardware platform for various

                       by the Security IC Embedded Software.
                       The Firmware Operating System for the hardware platform is called the Plain Firmware
                       Operating System (FOS-Plain) and the Firmware Operating System for the MIFARE
                       Software Emulation is called the Emulation Firmware Operating System (FOS- Emu).
                       The FOS-Plain provides an interface for programming of the internal EEPROM memory,
                       which is mandatory for use by the Security IC Embedded Software when programming the
                       EEPROM memory. Furthermore FOS-Plain provides an interface for the Post Delivery
                       Configuration functionality.
                       All configurations other than P60D024/016/012P include emulation MIFARE Plus
                       MF1PLUSx0 or MIFARE DESFire EV1 in the FOS-Emu. These emulations are represented
                       by the term MIFARE Software in this document. Note that MIFARE Software is not part of
                       the TOE (see Fig 2).

                              Release VB(Y) can be identified by ROM Code number xxx in the range of 005 to 013 and 092 to 095. All
                                 other ROM Code numbers are assigned to version VB(Z) and VB(A). The ROM code number can
                                 unambiguously identified by reading Security Row bytes RCN0 (DFFF8A) and RCN1 (DFF8B), see [9].
                                 In addition the ROM Code number is physically visible on the dice surface according to [12]. Releases
                                 VB(Z), and VB(A) share the same underlying hardware, but were adapted for yield improvement
                                 compared to VB(Y). Compared to Release VB(Z) the release VB(A) introduces additional configuration
                                 option. Releases VB(Z), and VB(A) can be distinguished by the Device Coding of “NXP option of
                                 PATDET configuration selection” in DC4 (“initial” for VB(Z), “a” for VB(A), see [9].

                            other ROM Code numbers are assigned to version VB(Z) and VB(A). The ROM code number can
                            unambiguously identified by reading Security Row bytes RCN0 (DFFF8A) and RCN1 (DFF8B), see [9].
                            In addition, the ROM Code number is physically visible on the dice surface according to [12]. Releases
                            VB(Z), and VB(A) share the same underlying hardware, but were adapted for yield improvement
                            compared to VB(Y). Compared to Release VB(Z) the release VB(A) introduces additional configuration
                            option. Releases VB(Z), and VB(A) can be distinguished by the Device Coding of “NXP option of
                            PATDET configuration selection” in DC4 (“initial” for VB(Z), “a” for VB(A), see [9].

                         Release VF contains update of for EEPROM start-up circuit for yield improvement. Release VF can be
                            identified by check of the silicon version code VMSK according to section 4.2 in [12]: h46 for VF
                            (others have VMSK value: h42).

                           The version of the Security IC Dedicated Software specified in Table 3, Table 4 and Table
                           5 can be identified by the Security IC Embedded Software by reading out the ROM Code
                           Number (RCN) as defined in [9], section 31.2.1. Furthermore, the version of the Firmware
                           Operating System as part of the Security IC Dedicated Support Software can be read-out
                           by Security IC Embedded Software using FVEC interface as specified in [9], section 13.4.1
                           Emulation Control Interface (FVEC0).


                 1.4.2 Evaluated configurations
                           The customer can select different logical configurations of the TOE. The configuration
                           options are structured as major and minor configuration options.


                 1.4.2.1        Major configuration options
                           The major configurations of the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF are given in Table 1. All
                           major configurations are equipped with an EEPROM of 24 kBytes and both, the ISO/IEC
                           7816 contact interface and the ISO/IEC 14443 contactless interface. Their major differences
                           are related to the availability of EEPROM space. The ‘024’, ‘016’ and ‘012’ specify the
                           accessible EEPROM memory.
                           The ‘y’ indicates the selection of the Firmware Operating System (FOS). It is a placeholder for
                           either ‘P’, ‘M’ or ‘D’:
                                  •    ‘P’ indicates the absence of FOS-Emu
                                  •    ‘M’ indicates FOS-Emu with MIFARE Plus MF1PLUSx0
                           7
                               Version 06.12 and version 06.13 include extensions on top of
                                  9047A_BM097_TESTROM_v1_btos_08v0A_fos_6v10.hex stored in Firmware Mode EEPROM.
                                  Choice of FOS version is dependent of “NXP option for EEPROM characteristics” in OEF, see [9].
                                  Hardware VB(Y) is restricted to Version 06.12 only.

                       The FOS-Emu including MIFARE Software is not part of the Evaluation.
                       Nine major configurations are present, which are denoted by the names P60D024P,
                       P60D016P, P60D012P, P60D024M, P60D016M, P60D012M, P60D024D, P60D016D and
                       P60D012D (see Table 1). The major configurations provide different versions of the IC
                       Dedicated Test Software and the IC Dedicated Support Software (see Table 3, Table 4
                       and Table 5).
                       One major difference between the major configurations is related to the availability of
                       EEPROM space to the Security IC Embedded Software:

                                   Table 7).
                       Each major configuration is provided with several minor configuration options, which are
                       introduced in Section 1.4.2.2. Each major configuration also provides customers with
                       several options for reconfiguration (Post Delivery Configuration), which are described in
                       Section 1.4.2.3 in detail.

                1.4.2.2     Minor configuration options
                          Minor configuration options can be selected by the customer via Order Entry Forms [13],
                          [14] and [15]. The first seven characters in the name of a major configuration give the type
                          name and therewith the Order Entry Form belonging to. The Order Entry Form identifies the
                          minor configuration options, which are supported by a major configuration out of those
                          introduced in Table 1.

                          Table 8. The availability of minor configuration options partly depends on the selected major
                          configuration option. However, in general the minor configuration options can be chosen
                          independently.
                1.4.2.3     Post Delivery Configuration
                          Post Delivery Configuration (PDC) can be applied by the customer himself after the TOE
                          has been delivered to that customer. These options can be used to tailor the TOE to the
                          specific customer requirements. The Post Delivery Configuration can be changed multiple
                          times but must be set permanently by the customer before the TOE is delivered to phase 7
                          of the life cycle.
                          The Post Delivery Configuration for the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF is listed in Table
                          9.

                          By applying Post Delivery Configuration the Security Rows content is updated for the
                          changed configuration options and can therefore be used for identification of the TOE after
                          applying any Post Delivery Configuration. Further details regarding Security Rows content
                          and identification of the TOE after applying Post Delivery Configuration refer to [9].
                          The Post Delivery Configuration can be accessed using chip health mode functionality in
                          combination with the ISO/IEC 7816 contact interface.
                1.4.2.4         Evaluated package types
                          A number of package types are supported for each major configuration of the TOE. The
                          commercial types are named according to the following format.
                            • P60D024ypp(p)/9Brrff(o) for major configuration P60D024PVB(Y/Z/A)/MVB(Y/Z/A)
                            • P60D016ypp(p)/9Brrff(o) for major configuration P60D016PVB(Y/Z/A)/MVB(Y/Z/A)
                            • P60D012ypp(p)/9Brrff(o) for major configuration P60D012PVB(Y/Z/A)/MVB(Y/Z/A)
                            • P60D024ypp(p)/9Frrff(o) for major configuration P60D024yVF
                            • P60D016ypp(p)/9Frrff(o) for major configuration P60D016yVF
                            • P60D012ypp(p)/9Frrff(o) for major configuration P60D012yVF
                          The commercial type name of each major configuration varies with the package type as
                          indicated by the variable pp and with the Security IC Embedded Software as indicated by
                          the variables rr and ff. Variable y identifies the activation of the firmware emulations.
                          Variable o identifies the EEPROM size of MIFARE Software. The number 9 is used as Fab
                          identifier and B/F references to the silicon version also available at major configuration
                          naming as VB/VF. The variables are replaced according to the rules in Table 10.

                                                 ‘M’ for MIFARE Plus.
                           pp(p)                 Package delivery type (alpha numeric, last character optional), e.g. “A4” for
                                                 MOB4 module.
                           rr                    ROM code number, which identifies the ROM mask.

                       For example, commercial type name P60D024PX0/9Brrff denotes major configuration
                       P60D024yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF in PDM1.1 dual interface smart card module. The characters ‘rr’
                       and ‘ff’ are individual for each customer product.
                       The package types do not influence the security functionality of the TOE. They only define
                       which pads are connected in the package and for what purpose and in which environment
                       the chip can be used. Note that the security of the TOE is not dependent on which pad is
                       connected or not - the connections just define how the product can be used. If the TOE is
                       delivered as wafer the customer can choose the connections on his own.
                       Security during development and production is ensured for all package types listed above,
                       for details refer to section 1.4.4.
                       The commercial type name identifies major configuration and package type of the TOE as
                       well as the Security IC Embedded Software. However, the commercial type name does not
                       itemize the minor configuration options of the TOE, which are introduced in section 1.4.2.2.
                       Instead, minor configuration options are identified in the Order Entry Form, which is
                       assigned to the ROM code number and the FabKey number of the commercial type name.

                  1.4.3 Logical Scope of TOE
                1.4.3.1     Hardware Description
                          The CPU of the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF supports a 32-/24-/16-/8-bit instruction
                          set and distinguishes five CPU modes, which are summarized in Table 12.

                          Table 12.    CPU modes of the TOE
                                            Super System Mode
                           Boot Mode            Test Mode                            Firmware Mode                     System Mode        User Mode

                          Boot Mode, Test Mode and Firmware Mode are sub-modes of the so-called Super System
                          Mode. These three modes are not available to the Security IC Embedded Software; they
                          are reserved for the Security IC Dedicated Software. The Security IC Dedicated Software is
                          composed of Security IC Dedicated Test Software and Security IC Dedicated Support
                          Software, (Boot-ROM Software and Firmware Operating System) as introduced in section
                          1.4.1. The three software components are mapped one-to-one to the three CPU modes: In
                          Boot Mode the TOE executes the Boot-ROM Software, in Test Mode the TOE executes the
                          IC Dedicated Test Software and in Firmware Mode the TOE executes the Firmware
                          Operating System. Please note that the Super System Mode is not a mode on its own:
                          When the TOE is in Super System Mode, it is always either in Boot Mode, Test Mode or
                          Firmware Mode.
                          The P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF is able to control two different logical phases. After
                          production of the Security IC every start-up or reset completes with Test Mode and
                          execution of the IC Dedicated Test Software. The Test Mode is disabled at the end of the
                          production test. Afterwards, every start-up or reset ends up in System Mode and execution
                          of the Security IC Embedded Software.
                          In case the minor configuration option ‘Post Delivery Configuration’ is enabled and not finally
                          locked by the customer, the resource configuration functionality allows the customer to
                          enable or disable specific functionality of the hardware platform, refer to Table 9.
                          In case the minor configuration option ‘Chip Health/Ident Mode’ is enabled, during the boot
                          process routines either starting built-in self tests checking the functional integrity of the TOE
                          or sending back identification items of the TOE can be activated by the user.
                          System Mode and User Mode are available to the developer of the Security IC Embedded
                          Software. System Mode has unlimited access to the hardware components available to the
                          Security IC Embedded Software. User Mode has restricted access to the CPU, specific
                          Special Function Registers and the memories depending on the access rights granted by
                          software running in System Mode. The hardware components are controlled by the Security
                          IC Embedded Software via Special Function Registers. Special Function Registers are
                          interrelated to the activities of the CPU, the Memory Management Unit, interrupt control, I/O
                          configuration, EEPROM, timers, UART, the contactless interface and the coprocessors.

NXP Semiconductors                                            P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF
                                                                                                                    Security Target Lite



                       The P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF provides two types of interrupts: (i) exception
                       interrupts, called “exception” in the following and (ii) event interrupts, called “interrupts” in
                       the following. Exceptions and interrupts each force a jump to a specific fixed vector address
                       in the ROM. Any exception and interrupt can therefore be controlled and guided by a specific
                       part     of     the    Security     IC     Embedded       Software.      In     addition,    the
                       P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF provides eight firmware vectors (FVEC) and 32 system
                       call vectors (SVEC). These vectors have to be explicitly called by the Security IC Embedded
                       Software. A jump to a firmware vector forces Firmware Mode and starts execution of the
                       Firmware Operating System, a jump to a system call vector forces System Mode.
                       The Watchdog timer is intended to abort irregular program executions by a time-out
                       mechanism and is enabled and configured by the Security IC Embedded Software.
                       The P60D024yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF incorporates 352 kBytes of ROM, 8.125 kBytes of RAM and
                       24 kBytes of EEPROM. Access control to all three memory types is enforced by a Memory
                       Management Unit. The Memory Management Unit partitions each memory into two parts:
                       The ROM is partitioned in 264 kBytes Application-ROM and 88 kBytes Test-ROM. 512
                       Bytes of the EEPROM are always reserved for the manufacturer area, 768 Bytes are always
                       reserved for IC Dedicated Support Software. The Security IC Dedicated Support Software
                       contains functionality for programming the user EEPROM which must be called by the
                       Security IC Embedded Software. Therefore, the Security IC Dedicated Support Software
                       has access also to the EEPROM area which is allocated to the Security IC Embedded
                       Software, the separation between user data and NXP firmware data is guaranteed by
                       means of a software firewall. 512 Bytes of RAM is allocated for the Firmware Operating
                       System and the remaining part for the application. Note that the ROM size is displayed as
                       264 kBytes in the block diagram in Fig 1 because only 264 kBytes are available to the
                       Security IC Embedded Software.
                       In Test Mode the CPU has unrestricted access to all memories. In Boot Mode and Firmware
                       Mode access is limited to the Test-ROM, the manufacturer area of the EEPROM and its
                       configured part of 768 Bytes as well as the configured part of 512 Bytes RAM for the
                       Firmware Operating System. All other parts of the memories are accessible in System Mode
                       and User Mode, namely the Application-ROM and the larger parts of EEPROM and RAM.
                       User Mode is further restricted by the Memory Management Unit, which can be configured
                       in System Mode.
                       The RAM, which is available to the Security IC Embedded Software, is further split in two
                       parts. These are 5.0 kBytes general purpose RAM (CXRAM) and 2.625 kBytes FXRAM
                       (associated to the Fame2 coprocessor). Both parts are accessible to the CPU, but the
                       Fame2 coprocessor can only access the FXRAM. The Fame2 coprocessor can access the
                       FXRAM without control of access rights by the Memory Management Unit. Since the
                       Memory Management Unit does not control accesses of the Fame2 coprocessor, software
                       which has access to the Fame2 coprocessor implicitly has access to the FXRAM.
                       The Triple-DES coprocessor supports single DES and Triple-DES operations. Only Triple-
                       DES is in the scope of this evaluation, in 2-key or 3-key operation with two/three 56-bit keys
                       (112-/168-bit). The AES coprocessor supports AES operation with three different key
                       lengths of 128, 192 or 256 bits. The Fame2 coprocessor supplies basic arithmetic functions
                       to support implementation of asymmetric cryptographic algorithms by the Security IC
                       Embedded Software. The random generator provides true random numbers without pseudo
                       random calculation. The CRC coprocessor provides CRC generation polynomial CRC-16

                          and CRC-32. The copy machine supports a mechanism to transfer data between specific
                          Special Function Registers as well as memories without interaction of the CPU.
                          The P60D024yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF operates with a single external power supply of 1.8 V, 3 V or
                          5 V nominal. Alternatively, the P60D024yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF can be supplied via the RF
                          interface by inductive coupling. The maximum external clock frequency used for
                          synchronization of the ISO/IEC 7816 communication is 10 MHz nominal, the CPU and all
                          co-processors are supplied exclusively with an internally generated clock signal which
                          frequency can be selected by the Security IC Embedded Software. The
                          P60D024yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF provides power saving modes with reduced activity. These are
                          named IDLE Mode and SLEEP Mode, of which the latter one includes CLOCK STOP Mode.
                          The TOE protects secret data, which are stored to and operated by the TOE, against
                          physical tampering. A memory encryption is added to the memories RAM, ROM and
                          EEPROM. EEPROM double read function is included in this memory to check data
                          consistency during EEPROM read. Chip shielding is added in form of active and passive
                          shield over logic and memories. Sensors in form of light, voltage, temperature and
                          frequency sensors are distributed over the chip area. The security functionality of the IC
                          hardware platform is mainly provided by the TOE, and completed by the Security IC
                          Embedded Software. This causes dependencies between the security functionality of the
                          TOE and the security functionality provided by the Security IC Embedded Software.


                1.4.3.2     Software Description
                          Operating system and applications of a Security IC are developed by the customers and
                          included under the heading Security IC Embedded Software. The Security IC Embedded
                          Software is stored in the Application-ROM and/or in the EEPROM and is not part of the
                          TOE. The Security IC Embedded Software depends on the usage of the IC hardware
                          platform.
                          The Security IC Dedicated Test Software, is stored to the Test-ROM and used by the
                          manufacturer of the Security IC during production test. The test functionality is disabled
                          before the TOE is delivered (operational use of the Security IC) by disabling the Test Mode
                          of the CPU in hardware. The Security IC Dedicated Test Software is developed by NXP and
                          embedded in the Test-ROM. The Security IC Dedicated Test Software includes the test
                          operating system, test routines for the various blocks of the circuitry, control flags for the
                          status of the EEPROM’s manufacturer area and shutdown functions to ensure that security
                          relevant test routines can not be executed illegally after phase 3.
                          The TOE consists of the Security IC hardware, the IC Dedicated Software and the
                          associated documentation. The following Fig 2 shows the logical boundary of the
                          hardware platform with the IC Dedicated Software.

                  1.4.4 Security during Development and Production
                       The Security IC product life-cycle is scheduled in phases as introduced in the PP [6]. IC
                       Development as well as IC Manufacturing and Testing, which are phases 2 and 3 of the life-
                       cycle, are part of the evaluation. Phase 4 the IC Packaging is also part of the evaluation.
                       The Security IC is delivered at the end of phase 3 or phase 4 in the life-cycle. The
                       development and production environment of the TOE ranges from phase 2 to TOE Delivery.
                       With respect to Application Note 3 in [6] the TOE supports the authentic delivery using the
                       “Chip Health/Ident Mode” and the FabKey feature. For further details on these features
                       please refer to the data sheet [9] and the guidance and operation manual [11].
                       During the design and the layout process only people involved in the specific development
                       project for an IC have access to sensitive data. Different people are responsible for the
                       design data and for customer related data.
                       The production of the wafers includes two different steps regarding the production flow. In
                       the first step the wafers are produced with the fixed masks independent of the customer.
                       After that step the wafers are completed with the customer specific mask, including the ROM
                       Code, and the remaining mask set.
                       The test process of every die is performed by a test centre of NXP. Delivery processes
                       between the involved sites provide accountability and traceability of the TOE. NXP embeds
                       the dice into modules, inlays or packages based on customer demand. Information about
                       non-functional items is stored on magnetic/optical media enclosed with the delivery or the
                       non-functional items are physically marked. In summary, the TOE can be delivered in four
                       different forms, which are
                           • dice on wafers
                           • smartcard modules on a module reel
                           • inlays
                           • packaged devices in tubes or reels
                       The availability of major configuration options of the TOE in package types is detailed in
                       section 1.4.2.4.


                  1.4.5 TOE Intended Usage
                       The end-consumer environment of the TOE is phase 7 of the Security IC product life-cycle
                       as defined in the PP [6]. In this phase the Security IC product is in usage by the end-
                       consumer. Its method of use now depends on the Security IC Embedded Software. The
                       Security ICs including the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF can be used to assure
                       authorized conditional access in a wide range of applications. Examples are identity cards,
                       Banking Cards, Pay-TV, Portable communication SIM cards, Health cards and
                       Transportation cards. The end-user environment covers a wide spectrum of very different
                       functions, thus making it difficult to monitor and avoid abuse of the TOE. The TOE is
                       intended to be used in an insecure environment, which does not protect against threats.
                       The device is developed for most high-end safeguarded applications, and is designed for
                       embedding into chip cards according to ISO/IEC 7816 [23] and for contactless applications
                       according to ISO/IEC 14443 [25]. Usually a Security IC (e.g. a smartcard) is assigned to a
                       single individual only, but it may also be used by multiple applications in a multi-provider

                       environment. Therefore, the TOE might store and process secrets of several systems, which
                       must be protected from each other. The TOE then must meet security requirements for each
                       single security module. Secret data shall be used as input for calculation of authentication
                       data, calculation of signatures and encryption of data and keys.
                       In development and production environment of the TOE the Security IC Embedded Software
                       developer and system integrators such as the terminal software developer may use samples
                       of the TOE for their testing purposes. It is not intended that they are able to change the
                       behaviour of the Security IC in another way than an end-consumer.
                       The user environment of the TOE ranges from TOE delivery to phase 7 of the Security IC
                       product life-cycle, and must be a controlled environment up to phase 6.
                       Note:           The phases from TOE Delivery to phase 7 of the Security IC Product life-cycle
                                       are not part of the TOE construction process in the sense of this Security
                                       Target. Information about these phases is just included to describe how the
                                       TOE is used after its construction. Nevertheless, such security functionality of
                                       the TOE, that is independent of the Security IC Embedded Software, is active
                                       at TOE Delivery and can not be disabled by the Security IC Embedded
                                       Software in the following phases.


                  1.4.6 Interface of the TOE
                       The electrical interface of the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF are the pads to connect
                       the lines power supply, ground, reset input, clock input, serial communication pad I/O1 and
                       depending on a minor configuration option TP1 and TP2, as well as two pads (called LA
                       and LB) for the antenna of the RF interface. Communication with the TOE can be
                       established via the contact interface through the ISO/IEC 7816 UART or direct usage of the
                       I/O ports. Contactless communication is done via the contactless interface unit (CIU)
                       compatible to ISO/IEC 14443.
                       The logical interface of the TOE depends on the CPU mode and the associated software.
                           • In Boot Mode the Boot-ROM Software is executed. Only in case the minor configuration
                             option “Chip Health/Ident Mode” is enabled, starting of built-in self test routines and
                             read-out of TOE identification items is supported. If this minor configuration option is
                             disabled the Boot-ROM Software provides no interface. In this case there is no
                             possibility to interact with this software.
                           • In Test Mode (used before TOE delivery) the logical interface visible on the electrical
                             interface is defined by the Security IC Dedicated Test Software. This Security IC
                             Dedicated Test Software comprises the test operating system and the package of test
                             function calls.
                           • In Firmware Mode the Firmware Operating System is executed by the CPU. The
                             Firmware Mode is always requested by the Security IC Embedded Software.
                           • In System Mode and User Mode (after TOE Delivery) the software interface is the set
                             of instructions, the bits in the special function registers that are related to these modes
                             and the physical address map of the CPU including memories. The access to the
                             special function registers as well as to the memories depends on the CPU mode
                             configured by the Security IC Embedded Software.

                           Note:    The logical interface of the TOE that is visible on the electrical interface after
                                    TOE Delivery is based on the Security IC Embedded Software developed by
                                    the software developer. The identification and authentication of the user in
                                    System Mode or User Mode must be controlled by the Security IC Embedded
                                    Software.
                       The chip surface can be seen as an interface of the TOE, too. This interface must be taken
                       into account regarding environmental stress e.g. like temperature and in the case of an
                       attack, for which the attacker manipulates the chip surface.
                       Note:        An external voltage and timing supply as well as a logical interface are
                                    necessary for the operation of the TOE. Beyond the physical behaviour the
                                    logical interface is defined by the Security IC Embedded Software.

2. Conformance Claims
                       This chapter is divided into the following sections: “CC Conformance Claim”, “Package
                       claim”, “PP claim” and “Conformance Claim Rationale”.

                 2.1 CC Conformance Claim
                       This Security Target and the TOE claims to be conformant to version 3.1 of Common Criteria
                       for Information Technology Security Evaluation according to
                           • “Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation Part 1: Introduction
                             and general model, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April 2017, CCMB-2017-04-001” [1]
                           • “Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation Part 2: Security

                           • “Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation Part 3: Security
                             assurance components, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April 2017, CCMB-2017-04-003” [3]
                       The following methodology will be used for the evaluation.
                           • “Common Methodology for Information Technology Security Evaluation: Evaluation
                             Methodology, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April 2017, CCMB-2017-04-004” [4]
                       This Security Target and the TOE claims to be CC Part 2 extended and CC Part 3
                       conformant. The extended Security Functional Requirements are defined in Chapter 5.



                 2.2 Package claim
                       This Security Target claims conformance to the assurance package EAL6 augmented. The
                       augmentation to EAL6 is ALC_FLR.1. In addition, the assurance package of this Security
                       Target is augmented using the component ASE_TSS.2, which is chosen to include
                       architectural information on the security functionality of the TOE.
                       Note:          The PP “Security IC Protection Profile” [6] to which this Security Target claims
                                      conformance (for details refer to section 2.3) requires assurance level EAL4
                                      augmented. The changes, which are needed for EAL6, are described in the
                                      relevant sections of this Security Target.
                       The level of evaluation and the functionality of the TOE are chosen in order to allow the
                       confirmation that the TOE is suitable for use within devices compliant with the German
                       Digital Signature Law.



                 2.3 PP claim
                       This Security Target claims strict conformance to the Protection Profile (PP) “Security IC
                       Platform Protection Profile, Version 1.0, registered and certified by Bundesamt für
                       Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) under the reference BSI-PP-0035” [6].
                       Since the Security Target claims conformance to this PP [6], the concepts are used in the
                       same sense. For the definition of terms refer to the PP [6]. These terms also apply to this
                       Security Target.

                       The TOE provides additional functionality, which is not covered in the PP [6]. In accordance
                       with Application Note 4 of the PP [6], this additional functionality is added using the policy
                       “P.Add-Components” (see Section 3.3 of this Security Target for details).



                 2.4 Conformance Claim Rationale
                       According to Section 2.3, this Security Target claims strict conformance to the PP “Security
                       IC Protection Profile [6].
                       The TOE type defined in section 1.3.2 of this Security Target is a smartcard controller. This
                       is consistent with the TOE definition for a Security IC in section 1.2.2 of [6].
                       All sections of this Security Target, in which security problem definition, objectives and
                       security requirements are defined, clearly state which of these items are taken from the PP
                       [6] and which are added in this Security Target. Therefore, this is not repeated here.
                       Moreover, all additionally stated items in this Security Target do not contradict the items
                       included from the PP (see the respective sections in this document). The operations done
                       for the SFRs taken from the PP [6] are also clearly indicated.
                       The evaluation assurance level claimed for this target (EAL6+) is shown in section 6.2 to
                       include respectively exceed the requirements claimed by the PP [6] (EAL4+).
                       These considerations show that the Security Target correctly claims strict conformance to
                       the PP [6].

3. Security Problem Definition
                       This Security Target claims conformance to the PP “Security IC Protection Profile” [6].
                       Assets, threats, assumptions and organisational security policies are taken from the PP [6].
                       This chapter lists these assets, threats, assumptions and organisational security policies,
                       and describes extensions to these elements in detail.
                       The chapter is divided into the following sections: “Description of Assets”, “Threats”,
                       “Organisational Security Policies” and “Assumptions”.

                 3.1 Description of Assets
                       Since this Security Target claims strict conformance to the PP “Security IC Protection
                       Profile” [6] the assets defined in section 3.1 of [6] are applied here. These assets are cited
                       below.
                       The assets related to standard functionality are:
                           • integrity and confidentiality of User Data stored and in operation,
                           • integrity and confidentiality of Security IC Embedded Software, stored and in operation,
                           • correct operation of the security services and restricted hardware resources provided
                             by the TOE for the Security IC Embedded Software.
                       To be able to protect these assets the TOE shall protect its security functionality. Therefore,
                       critical information about the TOE shall be protected. Critical information includes:
                           • logical design data, physical design data, Security IC Dedicated Software, configuration
                             data,
                           • Initialisation Data and Pre-personalisation Data, specific development aids, test and
                             characterisation related data, material for software development support, photomasks.
                       Note that the keys for the cryptographic calculations using cryptographic coprocessors are
                       seen as User Data.

                 3.2 Threats
                       Since this Security Target claims strict conformance to the PP “Security IC Protection
                       Profile” [6] the threats defined in section 3.2 of [6] are valid for this Security Target. The
                       threats defined in the PP [6] are listed below in Table 13.

                       Considering Application Note 5 in [6] the TOE provides additional functionality to protect
                       against threats that may occur if the hardware platform is used for multiple applications. The
                       TOE provides access control to the memories and to hardware resources providing security
                       services for the software.
                       The Security IC Embedded Software controls all User Data stored by the TOE. If multiple
                       applications are running on the TOE the User Data may belong to different applications.
                       The access to User Data from application A by the application B contradicts the separation
                       between the different applications and is considered as threat. The User Data is stored in
                       the memory and processed by the hardware resources.
                       The TOE shall avert the threat “Unauthorised Memory or Hardware Access
                       (T.Unauthorised-Access)” as specified below.
                       T.Unauthorised-Access                     Unauthorised Memory or Hardware Access

                                 Adverse action:                An attacker may try to read, modify or execute code or data
                                                                stored in restricted memory areas. And or an attacker may try
                                                                to access or operate hardware resources that are restricted by

                       Access restrictions for the memories and hardware resources accessible by the Security

                                                                                                                      Security Target Lite



                       The TOE provides specific security functionality, which can be used by the Security IC
                       Embedded Software. In the following, specific security functionality is listed, which is not
                       derived from threats identified for the TOE’s environment. It can only be decided in the
                       context of the application against which threats the Security IC Embedded Software will use
                       this specific security functionality.
                       The IC Developer/Manufacturer therefore applies the policy “Additional Specific Security
                       Components (P.Add-Components)” as specified below.
                       P.Add-Components                         Additional Specific Security Components
                                                                The TOE shall provide the following additional security
                                                                functionality to the Security IC Embedded Software:
                                                             • Triple-DES encryption and decryption
                                                             • AES encryption and decryption
                                                             • Integrity support of data stored in EEPROM
                                                             • Post Delivery Configuration: reconfiguration of customer
                                                               selectable options as listed in Table 9 (for the
                                                               P60D024yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF,P60D016yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF, and

                 3.4 Assumptions
                       Since this Security Target claims strict conformance to the PP “Security IC Protection
                       Profile” [6] the assumptions defined in section 3.4 of [6] are valid for this Security Target.
                       The following table lists these assumptions.

                       Table 15.     Assumptions defined in the PP [6]

                       The following assumptions are added in this Security Target according to Application Notes
                       7 and 8 in [6].
                       A.Check-Init                             Check of initialisation data by the Security IC Embedded

                                                                The Security IC Embedded Software must provide a function to
                                                                check initialisation data. The data is defined by the customer and
                                                                injected by the TOE Manufacturer into the non-volatile memory
                                                                to provide the possibility for TOE identification and for
                                                                traceability.
                       The following additional assumption considers specialised encryption hardware of the TOE.
                       The developer of the Security IC Embedded Software must ensure the appropriate “Usage
                       of Key-dependent Functions (A.Key-Function)” while developing this software in Phase 1
                       as specified below.

                       Clarification of “Usage of Hardware Platform (OE.Plat-Appl)”
                       The TOE supports cipher schemes as additional specific security functionality. If required
                       the Security IC Embedded Software shall use these cryptographic services of the TOE and
                       their interface as specified. When key-dependent functions implemented in the Security IC
                       Embedded Software are just being executed, the Security IC Embedded Software must
                       provide protection against disclosure of confidential data (User Data) stored and/or
                       processed in the TOE by using the methods described under “Inherent Information
                       Leakage (T.Leak-Inherent)” and “Forced Information Leakage (T.Leak-Forced)“.
                       If the Random Number Generator is used for leakage countermeasures, cryptographic
                       operations (e.g. key generation) or cryptographic protocols (e.g. challenge response) these
                       random numbers must be tested appropriately.
                       For multi-applications the Security IC Embedded Software (Operating System) can
                       implement a memory management scheme based upon security functionality of the TOE
                       to ensure the separation of applications.
                       Clarification of “Treatment of User Data (OE.Resp-Appl)”
                       By definition cipher or plain text data and cryptographic keys are User Data. The Security
                       IC Embedded Software shall treat these data appropriately, use only proper secret keys
                       (chosen from a large key space) as input for the cryptographic function of the TOE and
                       use keys and functions appropriately in order to ensure the strength of cryptographic
                       operation.
                       This means that keys are treated as confidential as soon as they are generated. The keys
                       must be unique with a very high probability, as well as cryptographically strong. For
                       example, if asymmetric algorithms are used, it must be ensured that it is not possible to
                       derive the private key from a related public key using the attacks defined in this Security
                       Target. If keys are imported into the TOE and/or derived from other keys, quality and
                       confidentiality must be maintained. This implies that appropriate key management has to
                       be realised in the environment.
                       The treatment of User Data is also required when a multi-application operating system is
                       implemented as part of the Security IC Embedded Software on the TOE. In this case the
                       multi-application operating system will not disclose security relevant user data of one
                       application to another application when it is processed or stored on the TOE.

                 4.3 Security Objectives for the Operational Environment
                       The following security objectives for the operational environment are specified according
                       to the PP “Security IC Protection Profile” [6].

                        Security objective   Description                                 Applies to phase ...
                           OE.Process-Sec-IC           Protection during composite product                            TOE delivery up to the end
                                                       manufacturing                                                  of phase 6

                       Check of initialisation data
                       The TOE provides specific functionality that requires the TOE Manufacturer to implement
                       measures for the unique identification of the TOE. Therefore, OE.Check-Init is defined to
                       allow a TOE specific implementation (refer also to A.Check-Init).

                 4.4 Security Objectives Rationale
                       Section 4.4 in the PP “Security IC Protection Profile” [6] provides a rationale how the
                       assumptions, threats, and organisational security policies are addressed by the objectives
                       that are specified in the PP [6]. Table 19 reproduces the table in section 4.4 of [6].

                       Table 20 provides the justification for the additional security objectives. They are in line
                       with the security objectives of the PP [6] and supplement these according to the additional

                       (T.Unauthorised-Access)” is as follows:
                       According to O.FM_FW, O.MEM_ACCESS and O.SFR_ACCESS the TOE must enforce
                       the partitioning of memory areas in Firmware Mode, System Mode and User Mode and
                       enforce the segmentation of the memory areas in User Mode so that access of software
                       to memory areas is controlled. Any restrictions have to be defined by the Security IC
                       Embedded Software. Thereby security violations caused by accidental or deliberate
                       access to restricted data (which may include code) can be prevented (refer to
                       T.Unauthorised-Access). The threat T.Unauthorised-Access is therefore covered by the
                       objective.
                       The clarification of “Usage of Hardware Platform (OE.Plat-Appl)” makes clear that it is up
                       to the Security IC Embedded Software to implement the memory management scheme by
                       appropriately administrating the TSF. This is also expressed both in T.Unauthorised-
                       Access and O.FM_FW, O.MEM_ACCESS and O.SFR_ACCESS. The TOE shall provide
                       access control functions to be used by the Security IC Embedded Software. This is further
                       emphasised by the clarification of “Treatment of User Data (OE.Resp-Appl)” which reminds
                       that the Security IC Embedded Software must not undermine the restrictions of the
                       hardware platform. Therefore, the clarifications contribute to the coverage of the threat
                       T.Unauthorised-Access.
                       The justification related to the security objectives O.HW_DES3, O.HW_AES,
                       O.CUST_RECONFIG and O.EEPROM_INTEGRITY is as follows: Since these objectives
                       require the TOE to implement exactly the same specific security functionality as required
                       by P.Add-Components, the organisational security policy is covered by the objectives.
                       Nevertheless the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing, O.Malfunction,
                       O.Phys-Manipulation and O.Leak-Forced define how to implement the specific security
                       functionality required by P.Add-Components. These security objectives are also valid for
                       the additional specific security functionality since they must avert the related threats also
                       for the components added related to the policy.
                       The requirements for a multi-application platform necessitate the separation of users.
                       Therefore it is volitional that most of the security functionality can not be influenced or used
                       in User Mode.
                       The justification related to the assumption A.Key-Function is as follows:
                           • Compared to [6] a clarification has been made for the security objective “Usage of
                             Hardware Platform (OE.Plat-Appl)”: If required the Security IC Embedded Software
                             shall use the cryptographic service of the TOE and its interface as specified. In
                             addition, the Security IC Embedded Software (i) must implement operations on keys
                             (if any) in such a manner that they do not disclose information about confidential data
                             and (ii) must configure the memory management in a way that different applications

                                                                                                                      Security Target Lite



                             are sufficiently separated. If the Security IC Embedded Software uses random
                             numbers provided by the security service SS.RNG these random numbers must be
                             tested as appropriate for the intended purpose. This addition ensures that the
                             assumption A.Key-Function is still covered by the objective OE.Plat-Appl although
                             additional functions are being supported according to P.Add-Components.
                           • Compared to [6] a clarification has been made for the security objective “Treatment of
                             User Data (OE.Resp-Appl)”: By definition cipher or plain text data and cryptographic
                             keys are User Data. So, the Security IC Embedded Software will protect such data if
                             required and use keys and functions appropriately in order to ensure the strength of
                             cryptographic operation. Quality and confidentiality must be maintained for keys that
                             are imported and/or derived from other keys. This implies that appropriate key
                             management has to be implemented in the environment. In addition, the treatment of
                             User Data comprises the implementation of a multi-application operating system that
                             does not disclose security relevant User Data of one application to another one. These
                             measures make sure that the assumption A.Key-Function is still covered by the
                             security objective OE.Resp-Appl although additional functions are being supported
                             according to P.Add-Components.
                       The justification related to the assumption "Check of initialisation data by the Security IC
                       Embedded Software (A.Check-Init)" is as follows:
                       Since OE.Check-Init requires the Security IC Embedded Software developer to implement
                       a function assumed in A.Check-Init, the assumption is covered by the objective.
                       The justification of the additional policy and the additional assumptions show that they do
                       not contradict to the rationale already given in the PP [6] for the assumptions, policy and
                       threats defined there.

                       The extended component definition used for Random Number Generator has been taken

6. Security Requirements
                       This part of the Security Target defines the detailed security requirements that shall be
                       satisfied by the TOE. The statement of TOE security requirements shall define the
                       functional and assurance security requirements that the TOE needs to satisfy in order to
                       meet the security objectives for the TOE. This chapter consists of the sections “Security
                       Functional Requirements”, “Security Assurance Requirements” and “Security
                       Requirements Rationale”.
                       The CC allows several operations to be performed on security requirements (on the
                       component level); refinement, selection, assignment, and iteration are defined in
                       paragraph 8.1 of Part 1 of the CC [1]. These operations are used in the PP [6] and in this
                       Security Target, respectively.
                       The refinement operation is used to add details to requirements, and, thus, further
                       restricts a requirement. Refinements of security requirements are denoted in such a way
                       that added words are in bold text and changed words are crossed out.
                       The selection operation is used to select one or more options provided by the PP [6] or
                       CC in stating a requirement. Selections having been made are denoted as italic text.
                       The assignment operation is used to assign a specific value to an unspecified
                       parameter, such as the length of a password. Assignments having been made are
                       denoted by showing as italic text.
                       The iteration operation is used when a component is repeated with varying operations. It
                       is denoted by showing brackets “[iteration indicator]” and the iteration indicator within the
                       brackets.
                       For the sake of a better readability, the iteration operation may also be applied to some
                       single components (being not repeated) in order to indicate belonging of such SFRs to
                       same functional cluster. In such a case, the iteration operation is applied to only one
                       single component.
                       Whenever an element in the PP [6] contains an operation that the PP author left
                       uncompleted, the ST author has to complete that operation.

                 6.1 Security Functional Requirements
                       The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) of the TOE are presented in the following
                       sections to support a better understanding of the combination of PP “Security IC
                       Protection Profile” [6] and Security Target.
                  6.1.1 SFRs of the Protection Profile
                       Table 21 below shows all SFRs, which are specified in the PP [6] (in the order of definition
                       in the PP). Some of the SFRs are CC Part 2 extended and defined in the PP [6]. This is
                       shown in the third column of the table.

                       The operations for all SFR except for the SFR FAU_SAS.1 and FCS_RNG.1 are already
                       performed in the PP [6]. They are not changed compared to the Protection Profile. The

                       For the SFR FAU_SAS.1 the PP [6] leaves the assignment operation open for the

                       For FCS_RNG.1.1 the PP [6] partially fills in the assignment for the security capabilities of
                       the RNG by requiring a total failure test of the random source and adds an assignment
                       operation for additional security capabilities of the RNG.
                       In addition, for FCS_RNG.1.2 the PP [6] partially fills in the assignment operation for the
                       defined quality metric for the random numbers by replacing it by a selection and
                       assignment operation.
                       For the above operations the original operations defined in chapter 5 of the PP [6] have
                       been replaced by operations defined in chapter 3 of [8] and the open operations of the

                       FCS_RNG.1.1[HW]                           The TSF shall provide a physical 12 random number generator
                                                                 that implements:
                                         (PTG.2.1) A total failure test detects a total failure of entropy source
                                                   immediately when the RNG has started. When a total failure is
                                                   detected, no random numbers will be output.
                                         (PTG.2.2) If a total failure of the entropy source occurs while the RNG is
                                                   being operated, the RNG prevents the output of any internal
                                                   random number that depends on some raw random numbers

                                                   source13.
                                         (PTG.2.3) The online test shall detect non-tolerable statistical defects of
                                                   the raw random number sequence (i) immediately when the
                                                   RNG has started, and (ii) while the RNG is being operated. The
                                                   TSF must not output any random numbers before the power-up
                                                   online test has finished successfully or when a defect has been
                                                   detected.
                                         (PTG.2.4) The online test procedure shall be effective to detect non-
                                                   tolerable weaknesses of the random numbers soon.
                                         (PTG.2.5) The online test procedure checks the quality of the raw random
                                                   number sequence. It is triggered at regular intervals or
                                                   continuously14. The online test is suitable for detecting non-
                                                   tolerable statistical defects of the statistical properties of the raw

                       Note:                                     The TOE provides the two options where the Embedded
