FMT_MTD.1.1/INI_ENA The TSF shall restrict the ability to write the Initialisation Data and Pre-personalisation
                    Data to the Manufacturer.
Application Note: The application note 42 of [PP_BAC] applies. This application note provides a definition, what
is meant by “Pre-personalization Data”. This definition is also applicable to FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA from
[PP_SAC]. Therefore FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be combined.

FPT_TST.1               TSF testing
Hierarchical to:        No other components.
Dependencies:           No dependencies.
FPT_TST.1.1             The TSF shall run a suite of self tests during initial start-up, to demonstrate the correct
                        operation of the TSF.
FPT_TST.1.2             The TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to verify the integrity of the
                        TSF data.
FPT_TST.1.3             The TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to verify the integrity of
                        stored TSF executable code.
Application Note: There is no contradiction between application note 46 of [PP_BAC] and application note 52 of
[PP_SAC]. In fact, although the wording is slightly different, the meaning of these application notes is identical.
Therefore either of these application notes applies and FPT_TST.1 from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be
combined.

                        responding automatically such that the SFRs are always enforced.
Application Note: Application note 47 of [PP_BAC] and 53 of [PP_SAC] are equivalent. Application note 48 of
[PP_BAC] is only informative to the reader in the sense, that it provides a context to an older CC standard, but
not relevant for the interpretation of FPT_PHP.3. Therefore either application note 47 of [PP_BAC] or
application note 53 of [PP_SAC] applies and FPT_PHP.3 from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be combined.

                       and chip shielding is added to the chip.
                       Note:        Large integer arithmetic operations are intended to be used for calculation of
                                    asymmetric cryptographic algorithms. Any asymmetric cryptographic
                                    algorithm utilizing the support for large integer arithmetic operations has to be
                                    implemented in the Security IC Embedded Software. Thus, the support for
                                    large integer arithmetic operations itself does not provide security functionality
                                    like cryptographic support. The Security IC Embedded Software implementing
                                    an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm is not included in this evaluation.
                                    Nevertheless the support for large integer arithmetic operations is part of the
                                    Security IC and therefore a security relevant component of the TOE, that must
                                    resist to the attacks mentioned in this Security Target and that must operate
                                    correctly as specified in the data sheet. The same scope of evaluation is
                                    applied to the CRC calculation.

                       The TOE consists of the IC hardware platform and Security IC Dedicated Software as
                       composed of Security IC Dedicated Test Software and Security IC Dedicated Support
                       Software. The Security IC Dedicated Test Software contains the Test-ROM Software; the
                       Security IC Dedicated Support Software contains the Boot-ROM Software and the
                       Firmware Operating System.All other software is called Security IC Embedded Software.
                       The Security IC Embedded Software is not part of the TOE.
                       The IC Dedicated Support Software consists of Boot-ROM Software controlling the boot
                       process of the hardware platform and the Firmware Operating System which can be called
                       by the Security IC Embedded Software.
                       The Firmware Operating System for the hardware platform is called the Plain Firmware
                       Operating System (FOS-Plain) and the Firmware Operating System for the MIFARE
                       Software Emulation is called the Emulation Firmware Operating System (FOS- Emu).
                       The FOS-Plain provides an interface for programming of the internal EEPROM memory,
                       which is mandatory for use by the Security IC Embedded Software when programming the
                       EEPROM memory. Furthermore FOS-Plain provides an interface for the Post Delivery
                       Configuration functionality.
                       All configurations other than P60D024/016/012P include emulation MIFARE Plus
                       MF1PLUSx0 or MIFARE DESFire EV1 in the FOS-Emu. These emulations are represented

                              Release VB(Y) can be identified by ROM Code number xxx in the range of 005 to 013 and 092 to 095. All
                                 other ROM Code numbers are assigned to version VB(Z) and VB(A). The ROM code number can
                                 unambiguously identified by reading Security Row bytes RCN0 (DFFF8A) and RCN1 (DFF8B), see [9].
                                 In addition the ROM Code number is physically visible on the dice surface according to [12]. Releases
                                 VB(Z), and VB(A) share the same underlying hardware, but were adapted for yield improvement
                                 compared to VB(Y). Compared to Release VB(Z) the release VB(A) introduces additional configuration
                                 option. Releases VB(Z), and VB(A) can be distinguished by the Device Coding of “NXP option of
                                 PATDET configuration selection” in DC4 (“initial” for VB(Z), “a” for VB(A), see [9].

                           The version of the Security IC Dedicated Software specified in Table 3, Table 4 and Table
                           5 can be identified by the Security IC Embedded Software by reading out the ROM Code
                           Number (RCN) as defined in [9], section 31.2.1. Furthermore, the version of the Firmware
                           Operating System as part of the Security IC Dedicated Support Software can be read-out
                           by Security IC Embedded Software using FVEC interface as specified in [9], section 13.4.1
                           Emulation Control Interface (FVEC0).


                 1.4.2 Evaluated configurations
                           The customer can select different logical configurations of the TOE. The configuration
                           options are structured as major and minor configuration options.


                 1.4.2.1        Major configuration options
                           The major configurations of the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF are given in Table 1. All
                           major configurations are equipped with an EEPROM of 24 kBytes and both, the ISO/IEC
                           7816 contact interface and the ISO/IEC 14443 contactless interface. Their major differences
                           are related to the availability of EEPROM space. The ‘024’, ‘016’ and ‘012’ specify the
                           accessible EEPROM memory.
                           The ‘y’ indicates the selection of the Firmware Operating System (FOS). It is a placeholder for
                           either ‘P’, ‘M’ or ‘D’:
                                  •    ‘P’ indicates the absence of FOS-Emu
                                  •    ‘M’ indicates FOS-Emu with MIFARE Plus MF1PLUSx0
                           7
                               Version 06.12 and version 06.13 include extensions on top of
                                  9047A_BM097_TESTROM_v1_btos_08v0A_fos_6v10.hex stored in Firmware Mode EEPROM.
                                  Choice of FOS version is dependent of “NXP option for EEPROM characteristics” in OEF, see [9].
                                  Hardware VB(Y) is restricted to Version 06.12 only.

                              •    ‘D’ indicates FOS-Emu with MIFARE DESFire EV1
                       The FOS-Emu including MIFARE Software is not part of the Evaluation.
                       Nine major configurations are present, which are denoted by the names P60D024P,
                       P60D016P, P60D012P, P60D024M, P60D016M, P60D012M, P60D024D, P60D016D and
                       P60D012D (see Table 1). The major configurations provide different versions of the IC
                       Dedicated Test Software and the IC Dedicated Support Software (see Table 3, Table 4
                       and Table 5).
                       One major difference between the major configurations is related to the availability of
                       EEPROM space to the Security IC Embedded Software:
                              •    For P60D024/016/012P 512 Bytes are reserved for Security Rows and

                                   Support Software control data (see Table 6).
                              •    For P60D024/016/012M and P60D024/016/012D 512 Bytes are reserved for
                                   Security Rows and configuration data of the manufacturer, 512 Bytes are reserved
                                   for IC Dedicated Support Software control data and depending on the MIFARE
                                   Software configuration8 several bytes are reserved for MIFARE Software (see
                                   Table 7).
                       Each major configuration is provided with several minor configuration options, which are
                       introduced in Section 1.4.2.2. Each major configuration also provides customers with
                       several options for reconfiguration (Post Delivery Configuration), which are described in
                       Section 1.4.2.3 in detail.

                          configuration option. However, in general the minor configuration options can be chosen
                          independently.
                1.4.2.3     Post Delivery Configuration
                          Post Delivery Configuration (PDC) can be applied by the customer himself after the TOE
                          has been delivered to that customer. These options can be used to tailor the TOE to the
                          specific customer requirements. The Post Delivery Configuration can be changed multiple
                          times but must be set permanently by the customer before the TOE is delivered to phase 7
                          of the life cycle.
                          The Post Delivery Configuration for the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF is listed in Table
                          9.

1.3 TOE Overview
The Security Target (ST) defines the security objectives and requirements for a
contact or contactless based chip of machine readable travel documents (MRTD)
based on the requirements and recommendations of the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO), EU requirements for biometric European passport
(Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 and Commission Implementing Decision
6181) and Biometric European Resident Permit (REGULATION (EU) 2017/1954
and Commission Implementing Decision 6178). This product is intended to
enable verification of the authenticity of the travel document and to identify its
holder during a border control, using an inspection system. The verification
process is based on Extended Access Control with Password Authenticated
Connection Establishment (PACE) and optionally Active Authentication (AA).

The main features and their origin are the following:
 Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
   according to ICAO Technical Report “Supplemental Access Control” [ICAO-
   9303] part 11 and strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0068-V2 [PACE-PP] for
   protection of the communication between terminal and chip. The following
   PACE mapping modes are supported and covered by the TOE:
      o    Generic Mapping (PACE-GM)
      o    Integrated Mapping (PACE-IM)
      o    Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM), which combines PACE-GM
           with Chip Authentication into a single protocol.

   Chip Authentication v1
    according to BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1], [TR-03110-3] and
    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    travel document’s chip to the inspection system.
   Terminal Authentication v1
    according to BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1], [TR-03110-3] and
    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    inspection system to travel document’s chip and protects the confidentiality
    and integrity of the sensitive biometric reference data during their
    transmission from the TOE to the inspection system.

As a feature that can be optionally configured the TOE supports:
   Active Authentication
    which according to [ICAO-9303] prevents copying the SOD and proves that it
    has been read from the authentic chip. It proves that the chip has not been
    substituted.


   Polymorphic Authentication
    which according to [PCA-eMRTD] provides additional privacy by randomisation
    of returned Polymorphic Identities, Polymorphic Pseudonyms and
    Complementary Polymorphic ID attributes in combination with standard ICAO
    and EAC1 eMRTD protocols specified in ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] and BSI
    TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1] and [TR 03110-3].

The TOE may also be used as an ISO driving license, compliant to ISO/IEC 18013
or ISO/IEC TR 19446 supporting PACE, AA and CA, as both applications (MRTD
and IDL) share the same protocols and data structure organization. Therefore, in
the rest of the document, the word “MRTD” MAY be understood either as a MRTD
in the sense of ICAO, or a driving license compliant to ISO/IEC 18013 or ISO/IEC
TR 19446 depending on the targeted usage envisioned by the issuer.

Application note
This TOE claims an assurance level EAL5 augmented with AVA_VAN.5 and
ALC_DVS.2. AVA_VAN.5 implies that the TOE is resistant to attacks performed by
an attacker possessing "High attack potential".
Not all key sizes specified in this security target have sufficient cryptographic
strength for satisfying the AVA_VAN.5 “high attack potential”. In order to be
protected against attackers with a "high attack potential", sufficiently large
cryptographic key sizes SHALL be configured for this TOE. References can be
found in national and international document standards. Further details have
been specified in the TOE’s guidance documentation [AGD_PRE].

[TR-03110] have also been refered to in ISO18013 for EU driving licences. The
BAP-1 protocol defined in ISO18013 is equal to Basic Access Protocol (BAC)
defined in [ICAO-9303]. As to the logical data structure, the ISO18013 uses the
same concept of Passive Authentication defined in [ICAO-9303], but specifies
different ISO7816-4 elementary file identifiers for storing the ICAO defined
content of DG3, DG4 and DG15.

When an Issuing state is using the product as an ISO compliant Driving licence,
the following name mapping of roles, definitions, data groups and protocol is
applicable within the scope of this security target:

Polymorphic eMRTD.


1.4.2.1 ICAO/EAC eMRTD and ISO Driving licence
This sub section explains the TOE security features for operational use of TOE
configured as ICAO/EAC eMRTD or as Driving Licence.

A State or Organisation issues travel documents to be used by the holder for
international travel. The traveller presents a travel document to the inspection
system to prove his or her identity. The travel document in context of this
Security Target contains:
  I.  visual (eye readable) biographical data and portrait of the holder,
 II.  a separate data summary (MRZ data) for visual and machine reading using
       OCR methods in the Machine readable zone (MRZ) and
III.  data elements on the travel document’s chip according to LDS in case of
       contactless machine reading.

The authentication of the traveller is based on:
  I.  the possession of a valid travel document personalized for a holder with
      the claimed identity as given on the biographical data page and
 II.  biometrics using the reference data stored in the travel document.

The issuing State or Organization ensures the authenticity of the data of genuine
travel documents. The receiving State trusts a genuine travel document of an
issuing State or Organization.

For this Security Target the travel document is viewed as unit of:
(i) the physical part of the travel document in form of paper and/or plastic
    and chip. It presents visual readable data including (but not limited to)
    personal data of the travel document holder
    (a) the biographical data on the biographical data page of the travel
         document surface,
    (b) the printed data in the Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) and
    (c) the printed portrait.

(ii) the logical travel document as data of the travel document holder stored
     according to the Logical Data Structure as defined in [ICAO-9303] as specified

     contact based / contactless readable data including(but not limited to)
     personal data of the travel document holder
     (a) the digital Machine Readable Zone Data (digital MRZ data, EF.DG1),
     (b) the digitized portraits (EF.DG2),
     (c) the biometric reference data of finger(s) (EF.DG3) or iris image(s)
          (EF.DG4) or both1,
     (d) the other data according to LDS (EF.DG5 to EF.DG16) and
     (e) the Document Security Object (SOD).


The issuing State or Organisation implements security features of the travel
document to maintain the authenticity and integrity of the travel document and
their data. The physical part of the travel document and the travel document’s
chip are identified by the Document Number.

The physical part of the travel document is protected by physical security
measures (e.g. watermark, security printing), logical (e.g. authentication keys of
the travel document’s chip) and organisational security measures (e.g. control of
materials, personalisation procedures) [ICAO-9303].These security measures can
include the binding of the travel document’s chip to the travel document.

The logical travel document is protected in authenticity and integrity by a digital
signature created by the document signer acting for the issuing State or
Organisation and the security features of the travel document’s chip.

The ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] defines the baseline security methods Passive
Authentication, advanced security access methods Basic Access Control (BAC)
and Password Authenticated Connection Establishment to the logical travel



These biometric reference data are optional according to [ICAO-9303]. This ST assumes that the issuing State or
1

Organisation uses this option and protects these data by means of extended access control.

document, Active Authentication of the travel document’s chip, Extended Access
Control and the Data Encryption of sensitive biometrics as optional security
measure. The Passive Authentication Mechanism is performed completely and
independently of the TOE by the TOE environment.

The BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1] and [TR 03110-3] specify the
Extended Access Control protocols Chip Authentication version 1 (CAv1) and
Terminal Authentication (TAv1), which are required to get secured access to the
biometric data stored in data groups DG3 and DG4 in combination with PACE or
BAC.

This Security Target addresses the protection of the logical travel document:
   (i) in integrity by write-only-once access control and by physical means, and
   (ii) in confidentiality by the Extended Access Control Mechanism.

This Security Target addresses the Chip Authentication Version 1 described in
[TR-03110-1] and PACE-CAM described in [ICAO-9303] part 11 as an alternative
to the Active Authentication stated in [ICAO-9303].

For Basic Access Control (BAC) supported by the product, a separate evaluation
and certification is performed with ST [ST-BAC].

The confidentiality by Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
is a mandatory security feature of the TOE. The travel document shall strictly
conform to the ‘Common Criteria Protection Profile Machine Readable Travel
Document using Standard Inspection Procedure with PACE [PACE-PP]. Note that
[PACE-PP] considers high attack potential.

For the PACE protocol according to [ICAO-9303] part 11, the following steps shall
be performed:
 (i) the travel document's chip encrypts a nonce with the shared password,
       derived from the MRZ resp. CAN data and transmits the encrypted nonce
       together with the domain parameters to the terminal.
 (ii) The terminal recovers the nonce using the shared password, by
       (physically) reading the MRZ or CAN data. This nonce shall be converted to
       a group generator using one of the following mapping algorithms, which
       maps a static generator to an ephemeral generator:
           a. Generic mapping (PACE-GM) or
           b. Integrated mapping PACE-IM)
 (iii) The travel document's chip and terminal computer perform a Diffie-
       Hellmann key agreement together with the ephemeral domain parameters
       to create a shared secret. Both parties derive the session keys KMAC and
       KENC from the shared secret.
 (iv) Each party generates an authentication token, sends it to the other party
       and verifies the received token.

In case of PACE with Chip Authenticated Mapping (PACE-CAM), in addition to the
steps above executed for the PACE-GM variant, the MRTD chip computes Chip
Authentication Data CAIC, encrypts them AIC = E(KSEnc, CAIC) and sends them

to the terminal. The terminal decrypts AIC and verifies the authenticity of the
chip using the recovered Chip Authentication Data CAIC.

After successful key negotiation, the terminal and the travel document's chip
provide private communication (secure messaging) [TR-03110-1], [ICAO-9303].

This Security Target requires the TOE to implement the Extended Access Control
as defined in [TR-03110-1]. The Extended Access Control consists of two parts:
  (i) the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1 and
  (ii) the Terminal Authentication Protocol Version 1 (v.1).

The Chip Authentication Protocol v.1
  (i) authenticates the travel document’s chip to the inspection syode functionality in
                          combination with the ISO/IEC 7816 contact interface.
                1.4.2.4         Evaluated package types
       stem and
  (ii) establishes secure messaging which is used by Terminal Authentication v.1
       to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the sensitive biometric
       reference data during their transmission from the TOE to the inspection
       system. Therefore Termina                   A number of package types are supported for each major configuration of the TOE. The
                          commercial types are named according to the following format.

A customer can identify the TOE hardware and its configuration (for details see chapter 1.4.7) using the Non-ISO
ATR. The Non-ISO ATR outputs a Common Criteria Certification Identifier and firmware identifier, which links
the TOE to this ST. Specific firmware functions can be used to determine the exact configuration of a device
from the certified range defined in Table 3.
The TOE can be ordered with a preloaded image. This image contains NVM loader functionality and is called
PFL (Performance Flash Loader) with version v09.10.90.9. The PFL is intended to be used in a secured
environment only and is not part of the TOE.

1.3               TOE Overview

1.3.1             TOE Definition and Usage
The TOE consists of smart card ICs (Security Controllers), firmware and user guidance meeting high
requirements in terms of performance and security designed by Infineon Technologies AG. This TOE is intended
to be used in smart cards for security-relevant applications and as developing platform for smart card
operating systems according to the lifecycle model from [PP0084]
The term Smartcard Embedded Software is used in the following for all operating systems and applications
stored and executed on the TOE. The TOE is the platform for the Smartcard Embedded Software. The
Smartcard Embedded Software itself is not part of the TOE. The TOE does not require any non-TOE
hardware/software/firmware.

1.3.2             TOE major security features

The TOE hardware consists of a core, a memory system and peripherals.
The major components of the core system are a 32-bit CPU (Central Processing Unit), an MPU (Memory
Protection Unit), a Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC) and an Instruction Stream Signature Checking
(ISS).
The MPU of the core stores code and data in a linear 4-GByte memory space (32-bit range), allowing direct
access without the need to swap memory segments in and out of memory using a memory protection unit.
There are two separate bus entities: a memory bus and a peripheral bus for high-speed communication with
the peripherals.
The SPAU can be configured by the user to block or allow peripheral access. It can also be used to block RAM
areas (For keeping Figure 1 simple, the connection between SPAU and RAM is not shown). The CPAU enables
the user to block or allow unprivileged level access to NVM and specific registers of ICS and NVM.

Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)

The CPU accesses memory via the Internal Ciphering System (ICS), which encrypts/decrypts memory content.
All data of the memory block is encrypted. The NVM is equipped with an error correction code (ECC). Security
modules manage the alarms. Alarms may be triggered when the environmental conditions are outside the
specified operational range.
A set of sensors (temperature sensor, backside light detector, glitch sensor, low frequency sensor) is used to
detect excessive deviations from the specified operational range and serve for robustness of the TOE. The
UMSLC function can be used to test the alarm lines.
A Random Number Generator (RNG) consist of a physical Random Number Generator with a cryptographically
strong post processing unit. It can be operated in the modes as follows:
 True Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.2
 Hybrid Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.3
 Deterministic Random Number Generation (DRNG) AIS31 DRG.3 and DRG.4

The Symmetric Cryptographic Processor (SCP) implements calculation of dual-key or triple-key triple-DES and
AES.
The µSM4 supports the Chinese standard encryption algorithm SM4.
The Crypto2304T co-processor provides basic means optimized for the implementation of fast and secure
software of many asymmetric or public key cryptographic schemes like RSA or elliptic curve based ones. The
user accessibility of the Crypto2304T is a customer ordering option
The implemented sleep mode logic (clock stop mode per ISO/IEC 7816-3) is used to reduce overall power
consumption.
The TOE is able to communicate using either its contact based or contactless interface (RF interface). The
contact based interface allows to use the ISO 7816 protocol via the UART. Further it offers a GPIO and an I2C
slave interface. The contactless interface can be configured to RFI or ACLB mode. Both interface types support
the signaling modes as follows:
 Signalling mode ISO/IEC 14443, Type A and Type B
 Signalling mode ISO/IEC 18092 passive mode, Type F
 NRGҹ interface

The UMSLC enables the user software to check the activity and proper function of the system’s security
features.
The Clock Unit (CLKU) supplies the clocks for all components of the TOE. The Clock Unit can work in internal
and external clock mode. When operating the internal clock mode the system frequency is derived from an
oscillator, whereas in external clock mode, the system clock is derived from an externally supplied interface
clock.
The watchdog timer triggers an event in case of a counter overflow. The timers are general purpose up-
counting timers.
A CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) module computes a checksum value from a message or any other block of
data.
The ROM is used by IFX only. The user software has to be implemented in SOLID FLASHҹ memory. The user can
choose, whether the software is loaded into the SOLID FLASHҹ memory by Infineon Technologies AG or by the
user.
The TOE uses Special Function Registers (SFRs). These SFRs are used for general purposes and chip
configuration; they are located in SOLID FLASHҹ memory in a configuration area page. The Online

Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)

Configuration Check (OCC) function is used for register protection, i.e. controls the modification of relevant
SFR settings.
In case a security violation is detected, secure state is entered by the hardware.

1.4.1.2            Firmware and software components
The TOE provides low-level firmware components: the Boot Software (BOS), the Performance Optimized Write
Scheme (POWS) and the Flash Loader (FL).
The BOS firmware is used for test purposes during start-up and the FL allows downloading of user software to
the NVM during the manufacturing process. All mandatory functions for start-up and internal testing are
protected by a dedicated hardware firewall with two levels “BOS” and “user”.
The POWS library is an internal firmware library, i.e. not accessible by the user. It is used by the BOS and FL to
store data in NVM in a tearing safe manner.
The Flash Loader allows downloading of User Software into the NVM during the manufacturing process.
The software of the TOE consists of optional packages:
   NRGҹ SW: The optional NRGҹ SW supports Card and Reader Mode, e.g. card creation, personalization and
    deletion. The NRGҹ SW does not implement any security functionality
   HSL: The optional HSL provides functionality via APIs to the Smartcard Embedded Software . which
    contains SOLID FLASHҹ NVM service routines and functionality for tearing safe programming of SOLID
    FLASHҹ NVM.
   UMSLC lib: this library provides a wrapper around the UMSLC hardware functionality with measures to
    counter fault attacks.
   Symmetric Crypto Library (SCL): The optional SCL is used to provide a high level interface to the TDES and
    AES cryptography, which is partly implemented on the hardware component SCP and includes
    countermeasures against SPA, DPA and DFA attacks. The SCL is delivered as object code and in this way
    integrated into the user software.
   Asymmetric Crypto Library (ACL): The optional ACL implements RSA and elliptic curve based cryptographic
    schemes

1.4.1.3            User Guidance components
The user guidance consists of the components as follows:
   32-bit Security Controller – V11, Hardware Reference Manual: description of hardware features and user
    interfaces

Notes for FCS_CKM.1.1/RSA-1 or FCS_CKM.1.1/RSA-2:
1. The function CryptoGeneratePrime has been assigned to the appropriate security level by BSI. The proprietary
CryptoGeneratePrimeMask function has not been cryptographic-analytically evaluated and certified by BSI.
End of note.

2. The minimum key length follows the national recommendations by the BSI which means that RSA key lengths
below 1976 bits are not included in the certificate. The key length requirements can differ between the countries.
Please note that the BSI expects this key length as appropriate until 2022 and recommends for longer usage
times key lengths of 3000 bits or higher.

3. For easy integration of RSA functions into the user’s operating system and/or application, the library contains
single cryptographic functions respectively primitives which are compliant to the standard. The primitives are
referenced above. Therefore, the library supports the user to develop an application representing the standard if
required.
Please consider also the statement of chapter 7.1.4.1.

4. The TOE can be delivered with or without one of the RSA libraries. In the case of coming without the RSA

 7.1.4.5.3     General Preface regarding Elliptic Curve Cryptography
The EC library is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software. The security functional
requirement covers the standard Brainpool [19] and NIST [26] Elliptic Curves with key lengths of 160, 163, 192,
224, 233, 256, 283, 320, 384, 409, 512 or 521 bits. For one part the definition of the key lengths follows the
national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100 bit security level by the BSI. Numerous other curve types, being also
secure in terms of side channel attacks on this TOE, exist, which the user optionally can add in the composition
certification process.
All curves are based on finite field GF(p) with value p є [241-1; 2521[ as well as curves based on a finite field GF(2n)
with size n є [41-1; 521] are su SOLID FLASHҹ NVM2.
FDP_SDI.2.2                  Upon detection of a data integrity error, the TSF shall correct 1 bit errors in the SOLID
                             FLASHҹ NVM automatically and inform the user about other bit errors3.

FDP_SDC.1.1                  The TSF shall ensure the confidentiality of the information of the user data while it is
                             stored in the RAM and SOLID FLASHҹ NVM4.




6.1.7                  Support of Flash Loader
The TOE provides a Flash Loader to download user data into the SOLID FLASHҹ NVM, either during production
of the TOE or at customer site. Depending on the configuration option EA the Flash Loader claims different sets
of SFRs. [PP0084] section 7.3.1 “Package 1: Loader dedicated for usage in secured environment only” is claimed
for both options. [PP0084] section 7.2 Package “Authentication of the Security IC” and [PP0084] section 7.3.2
“Package 2: Loader dedicated for usage by authorized users only” is only claimed in case TOE is ordered with
EA unavailable, however a subset of SFRs from loader package 2 is also claimed, if TOE is ordered with EA
available.

The key lengths used for the AES and DES functionality follow the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100
bit security level issued by the BSI1. This regulation excludes the single DES operation from the certification as it
is considered to be not sufficiently secure from algorithm perspective.
For both versions, the certification covers the SCL cryptographic functionality of the AES algorithm with key
lengths of 128, 192, 256 bits and the TDEA or TripleDES (TDES) algorithm with an effective key size of 112 and
168 Bits. For the version v2.04.002 the certification covers the CMAC functionality too.

Beside the inclusion and support of cryptographic libraries this TOE comes with the optional Hardware Support
Library (HSL) in different alternative versions significantly simplifying the management of the SOLID FLASH™
NVM functionality. The HSL (all versions) constitutes an application interface (API) accessing the HSL state
machine and abstracting low level properties like special function registers and settings of specific hardware

features. In short the HSL provides a user friendly also use case oriented interface considering endurance,
reliability and performance.
All HSL library versions are delivered as object code.
The HSL is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software.
All HSL versions implement, beyond the low level driver, the basic method In-place Update leveraging the
dedicated advantages of the new SOLID FLASH™ NVM technology.
In addition to the above, all HSL versions provide an advanced additional method called Incremental Write (IWR).
This method provides enhanced endurance of the SOLID FLASH NVM even beyond the erase endurance limits
for often written objects. Thus this method serves applications with a demand for high endurance and fast
writing times. On the other hand, the read times using this method are slower than the other methods provided.
The HSL versions provide tearing save behavior, whereas we define tearing as an untimed power cut off which
could occur anytime and in the worse therewith could also occur during writing to or erasing of pages in the
SOLID FLASH™ NVM.
If the HSL – all versions are meant - comes with the TOE and the user implements the offered configuration and
dedicated functions tearing save behaviour of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM is provided. In these cases the user does
not need to care about tearing events since either the old data or the new data are correctly in place.
In addition to the versions 01.22.4346 and 02.01.6634, the HSLs in versions 03.11.8339 and 03.12.8812 provide a
furthermore improved method for the Incremental Write (IWR).
But, even in the cases where the user decides not to use the HSL and did also not implement own routines
preserving the consistency of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM, the hardware protection means prevent from operation
of inconsistent data. Therefore, in no cases a tearing event leads to an exploitable situation respectively
vulnerability.
Anyhow, the user should be aware and is recommended to use either the HSL or implement own routines
managing tearing events since if there would occur a faulty programmed SOLID FLASH™ NVM location the TOE
ends operation at that point.

The order option CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CIPURSE™ CL) provides cryptographic functionality to
implement a CIPURSE™ V2 conformant protocol.
This protocol provides a secure mutual authentication of two entities, namely the terminal (denoted as PCD =
Proximity Coupling Device (CIPURSE™-compliant terminal)) and a smart card or a token in other form factors
which is called PICC. PICC stands for Proximity Integrated Circuit Card (CIPURSE™-compliant card).
Beside the mutual authentication, the protocol implements measures to maintain the integrity of the after
passing successfully the authentication transferred data. It depends on the chosen operation mode whether the
user requires integrity protection only, for example if the exchange is used in a secure environment only, or
whether complete protection including the encrypted transfer of user data between the two authentication
entities is an issue. Both operation modes are part of the CIPURSE™ open standard and offered as integrity
protection mode and as confidential communication mode.
By that the CIPURSE™ CL supports the user to implement systems conformant to the CIPURSE™ open standard
implementing a secured, interoperable and flexible transit fare collection solution, including ISO 7816, ISO/IEC
14443-4 communication and AES-128 bit cryptography for multiple payment types.
The CIPURSE™ CL is conformant to the CIPURSE™ open standard [18] for both, the PICC and then PCD software
parts. It implements the by the OSPT alliance standardized application interface for the card and the terminal
side.
The scope of this certification of this TOE covers all parts of the CIPURSE™ CL which are later implemented by
the user on the user card respectively token based on this TOE and the functionality of the PCD software part
which is implemented in the terminal side. The PCD software operates also on the hardware of this TOE which is
implemented in the terminal.
The CIPURSE™ CL implements the by the OSPT alliance standardized application interface for the card and the
terminal side.
The certification comprises the entire functionality of the optional CIPURSE™ CL implemented and operated on
the TOE hardware. On one hand the TOE can operate the PICC side software part as a token and on the other
hand, a second TOE product operates the PCD side software part if used inside a terminal or similar system.

Target of Evaluation Description


The environment on the terminal, the terminal systems, their security and their interfaces to the background
systems are not in the scope of this certification. The user operating system and further applications
implemented on the TOE are also out of scope of this certification.
To summarize, if used with the PCD software the certification view equals to the case where the TOE is running
the PICC software: The TOE operates one of the optional software parts of the CIPURSE™ CL – regardless
whether PICC or PCD part - and is enabled to communicate via the selected interfaces. The surrounding
environment is in both cases out of scope. The CIPURSE™ CL is delivered as object code and in this way
integrated in the user software.

The NRG software is a further order option, which implements the routines for a NRG interface. The NRG
implements an operating system handling the emulation of an NRG card together with the RF interface. One
part of the NRG software is permanently stored in the ROM and the second part consisting of patch and API is
located in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The second part is only present if the NRG is a part of the delivery. If the
NRG is not part of the delivery the ROM part is present but not used. The NRG implements tearing safe
behaviour in context with the SOLID FLASH™ NVM management and is therefore independent from the HSL.
The NRG NVM part is – if ordered – delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software.
The NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

Note 1:
The asymmetric cryptographic libraries regardless of the version chosen are delivery options.
Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations with the other libraries of or without these libraries. In the
case of coming without one or any combination of the asymmetric libraries the TOE does not provide the
Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or Elliptic Curve
Cryptography (EC).

The symmetric cryptographic library SCL, in two alternative versions, is a delivery option.
Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations with the other libraries of or without these libraries. In the
case of coming without the SCL the TOE does not provide the specific security functionality implemented by this
software. Even in case of a TOE coming without SCL, the symmetric cryptographic functionality is unchanged
covered by the hardware symmetric cryptographic coprocessor SCP.

The presence of the cryptographic library CIPURSE™ CL is a delivery option.
Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations with the other libraries of or without these libraries. In the
case of coming without the CIPURSE™ CL, the TOE does not provide the specific security functionality
implemented by this software.
End of note.

2.2.3          Interfaces of the TOE
       The physical interface of the TOE to the external environment is the entire surface of the IC.
       The electrical interface of the TOE to the external environment is constituted by the pads of the chip,
        particularly ISO pads, the CLK and power supply pads, as well as the pads used for contactless and
        contact based interfacing.
        A further electrical interface are the La and Lb pads used for the antenna connection and alternatively for
        the ACLB communication mode connecting an external reader chip which is not part of the TOE.
       The RF interface (radio frequency power and signal interface) enables contactless communication
        between a PICC (proximity integration chip card, PICC) and a PCD reader/writer (proximity coupling
        device, PCD). Power supply is received and data are received or transmitted by an antenna which
        consists of a coil with a few turns directly connected to the IC. Depending on customer orders the
        contactless interface options are set by means of blocking either at Infineon premises or at the premises
        of the user.
       The data-oriented I/O interface to the TOE is formed by the pads used for contact based or contactless
        communication.
       The interface to the firmware – regardless of the version chosen – is constituted by special registers used
        for hardware configuration and control (Special Function Registers, SFR).
       The interface of the TOE to the operating system is constituted by the RMS and by the instruction set of
        the TOE.
       The interface of the TOE to the test routines is formed by the BOS test routine call, i.e. entry to the test
        modes.

2.2.4          Guidance documentation
The following provides a brief overview of the document set constituting the user guidance for this TOE. The
exact document titles and versions are given in chapter 9.
    The document Hardware Reference Manual HRM [1] is the user data book of the TOE and contains the
        relevant module, function and feature description
    The document Production and Personalization User Manual [2] contains detailed information about the
        usage of the Flash Loader
    The document Programmers Reference Manual [3] describes the usage and interfaces of the Resource
        Management System RMS, of the NRG Software and of the RFAPI.
    The document [6] Security Guidelines User Manual provides the guidance and recommendations to
        develop secure software for and secure usage of this TOE.
    The document [7] Errata Sheet contains latest updates and corrections of the TOE relevant for the user
        and it is a kind addendum to the hardware reference manual HRM [1]. The Errata Sheet can be changed
        during the life cycle of the TOE. New Errata Sheet releases are reported in a monthly updated list
        provided from Infineon Technologies AG to the user. This list is not part of the certification process. Part
        of the TOE certification is the released version valid at the point in time the certificate was issued.
    The document asymmetric Cryptographic Library ACL [4-1] for Crypto@2304T user interface for the
        version v2.08.007 contains all interfaces of the RSA, EC and Toolbox library and are only delivered to the
        user in case the RSA library and/or the EC library is/are part of the delivered TOE.
    The document asymmetric Cryptographic Library ACL [4-2] for Crypto@2304T user interface for the
        version v2.07.003 contains all interfaces of the RSA, EC and Toolbox library and are only delivered to the
        user in case the RSA library and/or the EC library is/are part of the delivered TOE.

2.2.5          Forms of delivery
The TOE can be delivered:
    in form of complete modules
    with or without inlay mounting
    with or without inlay antenna mounting
    in form of plain wafers
    in any IC case (for example TSSOP28, VQFN32, VQFN40, CCS-modules, etc.)
    in no IC case or package, simply as bare dies
    or in whatever type of package

The form of delivery does not affect the TOE security and it can be delivered in any type, as long as the processes
applied and sites involved have been subject of the appropriate audit.
The delivery can therefore be at the end of phase 3 or at the end of phase 4 which can also include pre-
personalization steps according to PP [9]. Nevertheless in both cases the TOE is finished and the extended test
features are removed. In this document are always both cases mentioned to avoid incorrectness but from the
security policy point of view the two cases are identical.
The delivery to the software developer (phase 2  phase 1) contains the development package and is delivered
in form of documentation as described above, data carriers and/or download from a secure server containing the
tools and emulators as development and debugging tool.
Part of the software delivery can also be the Flash Loader software running on the TOE and receiving the
transmitted information of the user software to be loaded into the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The download is only
possible after successful mutual authentication and the user software can also be downloaded in an encrypted
way. This download can also be done at a third party acting as download service provider for the user. This
organization is subject of the user.
In any case, the user is after finalization of the download and prior delivery to the field obligated to permanently
lock further use of the Flash Loader. How the user can do this is detailed in the user guidance [2].
Note that it depends on the procurement order, whether the Flash Loader program is present or not.

The belonging user guidance documents are delivered in electronic form: Either by user downloads from a secure
server or alternatively on request as encrypted email attachment.

Target of Evaluation Description


2.2.6          Production sites
The TOE may be handled in different production sites until delivery, but the wafers of this TOE are produced in
Taiwan at two different production sites. For logistic and capacity reasons the production lines have been
doubled and thus this certification comprises the products of both production lines.
To distinguish the different production sites in the field, the two sites are coded into the Generic Chip Ident Mode
(GCIM) data. The exact coding of the generic chip identification data is described in the hardware reference
manual HRM [1].
The delivery measures are described in the ALC_DVS aspect.

The production lines are coded as follows:
Taiwan: One production line is coded with »0Dh« and the other is coded with »0Ah«

Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Conformance Claims (ASE_CCL)


The highest assurance component AVA_VAN.5 Vulnerability Assessment, advanced methodical vulnerability
analysis, is already standard requirement for the EAL6. Thus the augmentation is achieved by another assurance
class.

Conformance Rationale
This security target claims strict conformance only to the PP [9].
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is a typical security IC as defined in PP chapter 1.2.2 comprising:
•       the circuitry of the IC (hardware including the physical memories),
•       configuration data, initialization data related to the IC Dedicated Software and the behavior of the
security functionality
•       the IC Dedicated Software with the parts
•       the IC Dedicated Test Software,
•       the IC Dedicated Support Software.
The TOE is designed, produced and/or generated by the TOE Manufacturer.

Security Problem Definition
Following the PP [9], the security problem definition is enhanced by adding additional threats, organization
security policies and an augmented assumption. Including these add-ons, the security problem definition of this
security target is consistent with the statement of the security problem definition in the PP [9], as the security
target claimed strict conformance to the PP [9].

Conformance Rationale
The augmented organizational security policy P.Add-Functions, coming from the additional security
functionality of the cryptographic libraries, the augmented assumption A.Key-Function, related to the usage of
key-depending function, and the threat memory access violation T.Mem-Access, due to specific TOE memory
access control functionality, have been added. These add-ons have no impact on the conformance statements
regarding CC [10] and PP [9], with following rational:
•        The security target remains conformant to CC [10], claim 482 as the possibility to introduce additional
restrictions is given.
•        The security target fulfils the strict conformance claim of the PP [9] due to the application notes 5, 6 and
7 which apply here. By those notes the addition of further security functions and security services are covered,
even without deriving particular security functionality from a threat but from a policy.



3.1.1          Adding Objectives

Due to additional security functionality coming from
     the cryptographic libraries
            o O.Add-Functions,
     the memory access control
            o O.Mem-Access
     and objectives related to the Flash Loader
            o O.Authentication,
            o O.Cap_Avail_Loader,
            o O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader and
            o O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality
additional security objectives have been introduced.
These add-ons have no impact on the conformance statements regarding CC [10] and PP [9] with following
rational:

Public Security Target
Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Conformance Claims (ASE_CCL)


       The security target remains conformant to CC [10], claim 482 as the possibility to introduce additional
        restrictions is given.
       The security target fulfils the strict conformance of the PP [9] due to the application note 9 applying
        here. This note allows the definition of high-level security goals due to further functions or services
        provided to the Security IC Embedded Software.


3.1.2          AES and TDES

The PP [9] implements the optional policy cryptographic services P.Crypto_Service with its packages TDES and
AES. This TOE provides these optional packages requiring secure hardware based cryptographic services for the
IC Embedded Software as outlined in chapter 7.1.4.
Due to these optional additional security functionalities the security objectives O.TDES and O.AES have been
introduced. These add-ons have no impact on the conformance statements regarding CC [10] and PP [9], with
following rational:
      The security target fulfils the strict conformance claim of the PP [9] due to the application notes applying
        here. By these notes the addition of further security functions and security services are covered, even
        without deriving particular security functionality from a threat or a policy.


3.1.3          Loader

The PP [9] implements the optional policy for applying a Loader. The Loader is used to load data into the SOLID
FLASH™ NVM.
The Flash Loader provides the service for authentication and implements the Package for Authentication of the
Security IC containing FIA_API.1 Authentication Proof of Identity of the TOE against a user.
This means that the user clearly can identify the TOE on his external request. This fulfils the objective
O.Authentication, authentication to external entities, and obligates an objective to the environment
OE.TOE_Auth, external entities authenticating of the TOE as outlined in the PP [9].
The Loader policy defines the Package 1 with its policy P.LIM_Block_Loader where the Loader is dedicated for
usage in secured environment only and the Package 2 with its policy P.Ctlr_Loader where the Loader is
dedicated for usage by authorized users only.
 This TOE provides a Flash Loader complying with the optional packages:
       Package 1:
        Loader dedicated for usage in secured environment only
       Package 2:
        Loader dedicated for usage by authorized users only as outlined in sections 7.2 and 7.3 of the PP [9]
 Due to these optional additional security functionalities the security objectives
    O.Cap_Avail_Loader, capability and availability of the Loader,
    O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader, access control and authenticity for the Loader and
    OE.Loader_Usage. secure communication and usage of the Loader
    O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality, protection of the confidentiality of the TSF
    OE.Lim_Block_Loader, limitation of capability and blocking the Loader
have been introduced.

3.1.4         CIPURSE Cryptographic Library (CCL)

The TOE provides “Additional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions)” including the CIPURSE™
Cryptography. This cryptographic functionality implements additional cryptographic services by implementation
of a protocol providing a secure mutual authentication of two entities, namely the terminal (denoted as PCD =
Proximity Coupling Device (CIPURSE™-compliant terminal)) and a smart card or a token in other form factors
which is called PICC. PICC stands for Proximity Integrated Circuit Card (CIPURSE™-compliant card).
Beside the mutual authentication, the protocol implements measures to maintain the integrity of the transferred
data and preserves in parallel the confidentiality of the transferred data.
Due to these additional security functionalities the security objectives
     O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL
     O.Prot_Integrity
     O.Prot_Confidentiality
have been introduced.

The content of the PP [9] applies to this chapter completely.


4.1            Threats
The threats are directed against the assets and/or the security functions of the TOE. For example, certain attacks
are only one step towards a disclosure of assets while others may directly lead to a compromise of the
application security. The more detailed description of specific attacks is given later on in the process of
evaluation and certification.
The threats to security are defined and described in PP [9] section 3.2, respectively for T.Masquerade_TOE in
chapter 7.2.1.

4.1.1          Additional Threat due to TOE specific Functionality
Threat Memory Access Violation
The additional functionality of introducing sophisticated privilege levels and access control allows the secure
separation between the operation system(s) and applications, the secure downloading of applications after
personalization and enables multitasking by separating memory areas and performing access controls between
different applications. Due to this additional functionality “area based memory access control” a new threat is
introduced.
The Smartcard Embedded Software is responsible for its User data of the Composite TOE according to the
assumption “Treatment of User data of the Composite TOE (A.Resp-Appl)”. However, the Smartcard Embedded
Software may comprise different parts, for instance an operating system and one or more applications. In this
case, such parts may accidentally or deliberately access data (including code) of other parts, which may result in
a security violation.

The TOE shall avert the threat “Memory Access Violation (T.Mem-Access)” as specified below:

 T.Mem-            Memory Access Violation
 Access
                   Parts of the Smartcard Embedded Software may cause security violations by accidentally or
                   deliberately accessing restricted data (which may include code) or privilege levels. Any
                   restrictions are defined by the security policy of the specific application context and must be
                   implemented by the Smartcard Embedded Software.

Threat Diffusion of Open Samples
The additional functionality of a Loader as defined in the PP [9], section 7.3 requires to address the following
threat, as defined in the document “PP0084: Interpretation” [9.1].
The TOE shall avert the threat “Diffusion of open Samples (T.Open_Samples_Diffusion)” as specified below:

 T.Open_Samples_Diffusion         Diffusion of Open Samples
                                  An attacker may get access to open samples of the TOE and use them to gain
                                  information about the TSF (loader, memory management unit, ROM code …).
                                  He may also use the open samples to characterize the behavior of the IC and its
                                  security functionalities (for example: characterization of side channel profiles,
                                  perturbation cartography …). The execution of a dedicated security features
                                  (for example: execution of a DES computation without countermeasures or by
                                  de-activating countermeasures) through the loading of an adequate code
                                  would allow this kind of characterization and the execution of enhanced
                                  attacks on the IC.

Note:
This threat is only relevant if the Flash Loader is still available and the attacker would in addition have the
authentication key. If both would be given, then this would enable downloading additional software.
End of note.

4.1.2          Assets regarding the Threats
The primary assets concern the User data which includes the user data of the Composite TOE as well as program
code (Security IC Embedded Software) stored and in operation and the provided security services. These assets
have to be protected while being executed and or processed and on the other hand, when the TOE is not in
operation.
This leads to four primary assets with its related security concerns:
    / SC1 integrity of user data of the Composite TOE
     SC2 confidentiality of user data of the Composite TOE being stored in the TOE’s protected memory
        areas
     SC3 correct operation of the security services provided by the TOE for the Security IC Embedded
        Software
     SC4 continuous availability of random numbers

by both, when a true random number is used as seed for the deterministic random number generator. Note that
the generation of random numbers is a requirement of the PP [9].
To be able to protect the listed assets the TOE shall protect its security functionality as well. Therefore critical
information about the TOE shall be protected. Critical information includes:
      logical design data, physical design data, IC Dedicated Software, and configuration data
      Initialization Data and Pre-personalization Data, specific development aids, test and characterization
        related data, material for software development support, and reticles.
The information and material produced and/or processed by the TOE Manufacturer in the TOE development and
production environment (Phases 2 up to TOE Delivery) can be grouped as follows:
      logical design data,
      physical design data,
      IC Dedicated Software, Security IC Embedded Software, Initialization Data and Pre-personalization
        Data,
      specific development aids,
      test and characterization related data,
      material for software development support, and
      reticles and products in any form
as long as they are generated, stored, or processed by the TOE Manufacturer.
For details see PP [9] section 3.1.


4.2            Organizational Security Policies
The TOE has to be protected during the first phases of their lifecycle (phases 2 up to TOE delivery which can be
after phase 3 or phase 4). Later on each variant of the TOE has to protect itself. The organizational security policy
according to PP [9] covers this aspect.

 P.Process-TOE              Identification during TOE Development and Production
                            An accurate identification must be established for the TOE. This requires that each
                            instantiation of the TOE carries this unique identification.

Due to the augmentations of PP [9] and the chosen packages additional policies are introduced and described in
the next chapter.

4.2.1          Augmented Organizational Security Policy
Due to the augmentations of the PP [9] and the chosen packages additional policies are introduced.
The TOE provides specific security functionality, which can be used by the Smartcard Embedded Software. In the
following specific security functionality is listed which is not derived from threats identified for the TOE’s
environment because it can only be decided in the context of the smartcard application, against which threats
the Smartcard Embedded Software will use the specific security functionality.
The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the policy “Additional Specific Security Functionality
(P.Add-Functions)” as specified below.

P.Add-Functions                   Additional Specific Security Functionality
                                  The TOE shall provide the following specific security functionality to the
                                  Smartcard Embedded Software:
                                      Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA)
                                      Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC)
                                      CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CCL)
                                      Cipher based Message Authentication Code (CMAC by the SCL-1)

Note 2:
The cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL, and the Toolbox library as stated in chapter 1.1 are delivery
options. Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations of or even without these libraries. In the case of
coming without one or any combination of the cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL, the TOE does not
provide the Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or Elliptic
Curve Cryptography (EC) and/or CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library and/or Cipher based Message Authentication
Code (CMAC by SCL-1).
The Toolbox Library is no cryptographic library, provides no additional specific security functionality and thus the
Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
End of note.

The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the organizational security policy “Cryptographic services of the
TOE (P.Crypto-Service)” as specified below:

 P.Crypto-Service              Cryptographic services of the TOE
                               The TOE provides secure hardware based cryptographic services for the IC
                               Embedded Software.
                                   Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES)
                                   Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

Note 3:
This TOE can come with both cryptographic coprocessors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked
Crypto2304T, or with both crypto co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior
to the production of the hardware. In case the SCP is blocked, no AES and DES respectively CMAC computation
supported by hardware or SCL is possible. In case the Crypto2304T is blocked, no RSA and EC computation – of
any version as stated in chapter 1.1 - supported by hardware is possible. No accessibility of the deselected
cryptographic co-processors is without impact on any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to
the situation where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic co-processors.
End of note.

The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the organizational security policy “Limiting and Blocking the Loader
Functionality (P.Lim_Block_Loader)” as specified below:

 P.Lim_Block_Loader             Limiting and Blocking the Loader Functionality
                                The composite manufacturer uses the Loader for loading of Security IC
                                Embedded Software, user data of the Composite Product or IC Dedicated
                                Support Software in charge of the IC Manufacturer. He limits the capability
                                and blocks the availability of the Loader in order to protect stored data from
                                disclosure and manipulation.
 P.Ctrl_Loader                  Controlled usage to Loader Functionality
                                Authorized user controls the usage of the Loader functionality in order to
                                protect stored and loaded user data from disclosure and manipulation.



4.3           Assumptions
The TOE assumptions on the operational environment are defined and described in PP [9] section 3.4.
The assumptions concern the phases where the TOE has left the chip manufacturer.
The support of cipher schemas requires an additional assumption.

 A.Process-Sec-IC                Protection during Packaging, Finishing and Personalization
                                 It is assumed that security procedures are used after delivery of the TOE by
                                 the TOE Manufacturer up to delivery to the end-consumer to maintain
                                 confidentiality and integrity of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test
                                 data (to prevent any possible copy, modification, retention, theft or
                                 unauthorized use).
 A.Resp-Appl                     Treatment of User data of the Composite TOE
                                 All User data of the Composite TOE are owned by Security IC Embedded
                                 Software. Therefore, it must be assumed that security relevant User data of
                                 the Composite TOE (especially cryptographic keys) are treated by the
                                 Security IC Embedded Software as defined for its specific application context.


4.3.1         Augmented Assumptions
The developer of the Smartcard Embedded Software must ensure the appropriate “Usage of Key-dependent
Functions (A.Key-Function)” while developing this software in Phase 1 as specified below.

 A.Key-Function               Usage of Key-dependent Functions
                              Key-dependent functions (if any) shall be implemented in the Smartcard
                              Embedded Software in a way that they are not susceptible to leakage attacks
                              (as described under T.Leak-Inherent and T.Leak-Forced).

Note that here the routines which may compromise keys when being executed are part of the Smartcard
Embedded Software. In contrast to this the threats T.Leak-Inherent and T.Leak-Forced address (i) the
cryptographic routines which are part of the TOE. For details please refer to PP [9] section 3.4.

4.3.2          Note regarding CIPURSE™ CL
The CIPURSE™ CL as cryptographic functionality establishes a cryptographic secured communication channel
between two identified entities. Depending on the implementation and usage, the CIPURSE™ CL can act either
in the PICC or in the PCD role. In any case the secrets applied for establishing and usage of the secured channel
must be treated in an appropriate way by both entities PICC and PCD.
This means that it is essential on user side that the critical data for establishing this cryptographic secured
communication channel is generated and stored in an appropriate way and that integrity and confidentiality is
maintained.
These preconditions are treated in the PP [9] section 3.1 claims 67 and 68, and are the reason for not placing an
assumption here.

                                  Cipher base Message authentication code (CMAC)

Note 5:
The cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL and the Toolbox library are delivery options, regardless of the
version chosen. Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations of or even without these libraries. In the
case of coming without one or any combination of the cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL the TOE does
not provide the Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or

 O.Mem Access                Area based Memory Access Control
                             The TOE must provide the Smartcard Embedded Software with the capability to
                             define restricted access memory areas. The TOE must then enforce the
                             partitioning of such memory areas so that access of software to memory areas and
                             privilege levels is controlled as required, for example, in a multi-application

below:

O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality Protection of the confidentiality of the TSF
                           The TOE must provide protection against disclosure of confidential operations of
                           the Security IC (loader, memory management unit …) through the use of a
                           dedicated code loaded on open samples.

If the CIPURSE™ CL is ordered the additional functionality address the following objectives as defined in this
document:

 O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL              Authentication of entities
                              The CIPURSE™ CL must implement mutual authentication to establish a ready to

                              any other communication between the two entities is applied.

 O.Prot_Integrity             Integrity protection
                              The CIPURSE™ CL must implement integrity protection functionality for the user

The security objectives for the security IC embedded software development environment and the operational
environment are defined in PP [9] section 4.2, 4.3, 7.2.1and 7.3.

For secure use of the CIPURSE™ CL it is essential that on user side the common secret is generated and stored in

Note 8:
The objectives OE.Lim_Block_Loader, OE.TOE_Auth, OE.Loader_Usage and OE.Process-Sec-IC for the
development and operation environment apply only at TOE products coming with activated Flash Loader
enabled for user data download. In other cases the Flash Loader is not available anymore and the user data
download is completed. Depending on the capabilities of the user software this objective may then reoccur as
subject of the composite TOE.
End of note.


5.3            Security Objectives for the Environment
Since the CIPURSE™ CL requires the presence of a common secret on both communication entities an additional
objective for the environment is generated:
Following objectives are defined here.

 OE.Resp-Appl                  Treatment of User data of the Composite TOE
                               Please refer to chapter 5.3.1 for clarification

Note 9:
The CIPURSE™ CL is a delivery option. In case the user has ordered the CIPURSE™ CL, the user is responsible to
implement the CIPURSE™ CL into his user software. In addition, the user has to generate and treat the common
secret in an appropriate way. The objective common secret is therefore similar to the OE.Resp-Appl. Anyhow,
processes and treatment is exclusively subject of the user and his logistic processes.
End of note.

Note 10:
If the user decides to use the integrity protection mode of the CIPURSE™ CL then the confidentiality of the user
data to be transferred is solely subject of the user.
End of note.

Note 11:
The CIPURSE™ CL as cryptographic functionality establishes a cryptographic secured communication channel
between two identified entities. Depending on the implementation and usage, the CIPURSE™ CL can act either
in the PICC or in the PCD role. In any case the secrets applied for establishing and usage of the secured channel
must be treated in an appropriate way by both entities PICC and PCD.
This means that it is essential on user side that the critical data for establishing this cryptographic secured
communication channel is generated and stored in an appropriate way and that integrity and confidentiality is
maintained.
These preconditions are treated in the PP [9] section 3.1 claims 67 and 68, and are the reason for not placing an
objective for the environment here.

(1) These objectives are only valid if the TOE is delivered with active Flash Loader.


5.3.1          Clarification of “Treatment of User Data (OE.Resp-Appl)”
Regarding the cryptographic services this objective of the environment has to be clarified.
By definition cipher or plain text data and cryptographic keys are user data of the Composite TOE. The
Smartcard Embedded Software shall treat these data appropriately, use only proper secret keys (chosen from a
large key space) as input for the cryptographic function of the TOE and use keys and functions appropriately in
order to ensure the strength of cryptographic operation.
This means that keys are treated as confidential as soon as they are generated. The keys must be unique with a
very high probability, as well as cryptographically strong. For example, it must be ensured that it is beyond
practicality to derive the private key from a public key if asymmetric algorithms are used. If keys are imported
into the TOE and/or derived from other keys, quality and confidentiality must be maintained. This implies that
appropriate key management has to be realized in the environment.
Regarding the memory, software and firmware protection and the SFR and peripheral access rights handling
these objectives of the environment has to be clarified. The treatment of user data of the Composite TOE is also
required when a multi-application operating system is implemented as part of the Smartcard Embedded
Software on the TOE. In this case the multi-application operating system should not disclose security relevant
user data of one application to another application when it is processed or stored on the TOE.


5.3.2     Clarification of “Protection during Composite product Manufacturing
(OE.Process-Sec-IC)”
The protection during packaging, finishing and personalization includes also the personalization process (Flash
Loader) and the personalization data (TOE software components) during Phase 4, Phase 5 and Phase 6.

Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


 5.5           P.Add-Functions
The justification related to the security objective “Additional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions)”
is as follows: Since O.Add-Functions requires the TOE to implement exactly the same specific security
functionality as required by P.Add-Functions; the organizational security policy is covered by the objective.

Nevertheless the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing, O.Malfunction, O.Phys-Manipulation and
O.Leak-Forced define how to implement the specific security functionality required by P.Add-Functions. (Note
that these objectives support that the specific security functionality is provided in a secure way as expected from
P.Add-Functions.) Especially O.Leak-Inherent and O.Leak-Forced refer to the protection of confidential data
(User data of the Composite TOE or TSF data) in general. User data of the Composite TOE are also processed by
the specific security functionality required by P.Add-Functions.

The policy P.Add functions includes the function CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CCL). This functionality
implements the objectives O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL, O.Prot_Integrity and O.Prot_Confidentiality. The CIPURSE™
Cryptographic Library (CCL) first prepares and establishes a secure communication channel between two
authenticated entities. The mutual authentication means covers the objective O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL. The
implemented means of session key generation and integrity protection prepares for the confidential and
integrity protected exchange of user data between the two authenti        Assets regarding the Threats
The primary assets concern the User data which includes the user data of the Composite TOE as well as program
code (Security IC Embedded Software) stored and in operation and the provided security services. These assets
have to be protected while being executed and or processed and on the other hand, when the TOE is not in
operation.
This leads to four primary assets with its related security concerns:
    / SC1 integrity of user data of the Composite TOE
     SC2 confidentiality of user data of the Composite TOE being stored in the TOE’s protected memory
        areas
     SC3 correct operation of the security services provided by the TOE for the Security IC Embedded
        Software
     SC4 continuous availability of random numbers
SC4 is an additional security service provided by this TOE which is the availability of random numbers. These
random numbers are generated either by a true random number or a deterministic random number generator or

                                                                                                             2020-04-22

by both, when a true random number is used as seed for the deterministic random number generator. Note that
the generation of random numbers is a requirement of the PP [9].
To be able to protect the listed assets the TOE shall protect its security functionality as well. Therefore critical
information about the TOE shall be protected. Critical information includes:
      logical design data, physical design data, IC Dedicated Software, and configuration data
      Initialization Data and Pre-personalization Data, specific development aids, test and characterization
        related data, material for software development support, and reticles.
The information and material produced and/or processed by the TOE Manufacturer in the TOE development and
production environment (Phases 2 up to TOE Delivery) can be grouped as follows:
      logical design data,
      physical design data,
      IC Dedicated Software, Security IC Embedded Software, Initialization Data and Pre-personalization
        Data,
      specific development aids,
      test and characterization related data,
      material for software development support, and
      reticles and products in any form
as long as they are generated, stored, or processed by the TOE Manufacturer.
For details see PP [9] section 3.1.


4.2            Organizational Security Policies
The TOE has to be protected during the first phases of their lifecycle (phases 2 up to TOE delivery which can be
after phase 3 or phase 4). Later on each variant of the TOE has to protect itself. The organizational security policy
according to PP [9] covers this aspect.

 P.Process-TOE              Identification during TOE Development and Production
                            An accurate identification must be established for the TOE. This requires that each
                            instantiation of the TOE carries this unique identification.

Due to the augmentations of PP [9] and the chosen packages additional policies are introduced and described in
the next chapter.

4.2.1          Augmented Organizational Security Policy
Due to the augmentations of the PP [9] and the chosen packages additional policies are introduced.
The TOE provides specific security functionality, which can be used by the Smartcard Embedded Software. In the
following specific security functionality is listed which is not derived from threats identified for the TOE’s
environment because it can only be decided in the context of the smartcard application, against which threats
the Smartcard Embedded Software will use the specific security functionality.
The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the policy “Additional Specific Security Functionality
(P.Add-Functions)” as specified below.

P.Add-Functions                   Additional Specific Security Functionality
                                  The TOE shall provide the following specific security functionality to the
                                  Smartcard Embedded Software:
                                      Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA)
                                      Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC)
                                      CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CCL)
                                      Cipher based Message Authentication Code (CMAC by the SCL-1)

Note 2:
The cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL, and the Toolbox library as stated in chapter 1.1 are delivery
options. Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations of or even without these libraries. In the case of
coming without one or any combination of the cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL, the TOE does not
provide the Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or Elliptic
Curve Cryptography (EC) and/or CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library and/or Cipher based Message Authentication
Code (CMAC by SCL-1).
The Toolbox Library is no cryptographic library, provides no additional specific security functionality and thus the
Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
End of note.

The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the organizational security policy “Cryptographic services of the
TOE (P.Crypto-Service)” as specified below:

 P.Crypto-Service              Cryptographic services of the TOE
                               The TOE provides secure hardware based cryptographic services for the IC

This TOE can come with both cryptographic coprocessors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked
Crypto2304T, or with both crypto co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior
to the production of the hardware. In case the SCP is blocked, no AES and DES respectively CMAC computation
supported by hardware or SCL is possible. In case the Crypto2304T is blocked, no RSA and EC computation – of
any version as stated in chapter 1.1 - supported by hardware is possible. No accessibility of the deselected
cryptographic co-processors is without impact on any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to
the situation where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic co-processors.

The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the organizational security policy “Limiting and Blocking the Loader
Functionality (P.Lim_Block_Loader)” as specified below:

 P.Lim_Block_Loader             Limiting and Blocking the Loader Functionality
                                The composite manufacturer uses the Loader for loading of Security IC
                                Embedded Software, user data of the Composite Product or IC Dedicated
                                Support Software in charge of the IC Manufacturer. He limits the capability
                                and blocks the availability of the Loader in order to protect stored data from
                                disclosure and manipulation.
 P.Ctrl_Loader                  Controlled usage to Loader Functionality
                                Authorized user controls the usage of the Loader functionality in order to
                                protect stored and loaded user data from disclosure and manipulation.



4.3           Assumptions
The TOE assumptions on the operational environment are defined and described in PP [9] section 3.4.
The assumptions concern the phases where the TOE has left the chip manufacturer.
The support of cipher schemas requires an additional assumption.

 A.Process-Sec-IC                Protection during Packaging, Finishing and Personalization
                                 It is assumed that security procedures are used after delivery of the TOE by
                                 the TOE Manufacturer up to delivery to the end-consumer to maintain
                                 confidentiality and integrity of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test
                                 data (to prevent any possible copy, modification, retention, theft or
                                 unauthorized use).
 A.Resp-Appl                     Treatment of User data of the Composite TOE
                                 All User data of the Composite TOE are owned by Security IC Embedded
                                 Software. Therefore, it must be assumed that security relevant User data of
                                 the Composite TOE (especially cryptographic keys) are treated by the
                                 Security IC Embedded Software as defined for its specific application context.


4.3.1         Augmented Assumptions
The developer of the Smartcard Embedded Software must ensure the appropriate “Usage of Key-dependent
Functions (A.Key-Function)” while developing this software in Phase 1 as specified below.

 A.Key-Function               Usage of Key-dependent Functions
                              Key-dependent functions (if any) shall be implemented in the Smartcard
                              Embedded Software in a way that they are not susceptible to leakage attacks
                              (as described under T.Leak-Inherent and T.Leak-Forced).

Note that here the routines which may compromise keys when being executed are part of the Smartcard
Embedded Software. In contrast to this the threats T.Leak-Inherent and T.Leak-Forced address (i) the
cryptographic routines which are part of the TOE. For details please refer to PP [9] section 3.4.

4.3.2          Note regarding CIPURSE™ CL
The CIPURSE™ CL as cryptographic functionality establishes a cryptographic secured communication channel
between two identified entities. Depending on the implementation and usage, the CIPURSE™ CL can act either
in the PICC or in the PCD role. In any case the secrets applied for establishing and usage of the secured channel
must be treated in an appropriate way by both entities PICC and PCD.
This means that it is essential on user side that the critical data for establishing this cryptographic secured
communication channel is generated and stored in an appropriate way and that integrity and confidentiality is
maintained.
These preconditions are treated in the PP [9] section 3.1 claims 67 and 68, and are the reason for not placing an
assumption here.

 5             Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)
This section shows the subjects and objects where are relevant to the TOE.
A short overview is given in the following.
The user has the following standard high-level security goals related to the assets:
     SG1 maintain the integrity of user data (when being executed/processed and when being stored in the
        TOE´s memories)
     SG2 maintain the confidentiality of user data (when being executed/processed and when being stored in
        the TOE´s memories)
     SG3 maintain the correct operation of the security services provided by the TOE for the Security IC
        Embedded Software
     SG4 provision of random numbers.

Note 4:
The objectives O.Cap_Avail_Loader, O. Authentication, O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader and O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality
apply only at TOE products coming with activated Flash Loader enabled for software or data download by the
user. In other cases the Flash Loader is not available anymore and the user software or data download is
completed. Depending on the capabilities of the user software these objectives may then reoccur as subject of
the composite TOE.
End of note.

The TOE provides “Additional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions)” as specified below.

 O.Add-Functions              Additional Specific Security Functionality
                              The TOE must provide the following specific security functionality to the
                              Smartcard Embedded Software:
                                  Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA)
                                  Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC)
                                  CIPURSE™ Cryptography
                                  Cipher base Message authentication code (CMAC)

Note 5:
The cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL and the Toolbox library are delivery options, regardless of the
version chosen. Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations of or even without these libraries. In the
case of coming without one or any combination of the cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL the TOE does
not provide the Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC) and/or CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library and/or Cipher based Message
Authentication Code (CMAC by the SCL-1).
The Toolbox Library is no cryptographic library, provides no additional specific security functionality and thus the
Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
End of note.

Note 6:
This TOE can come with both crypto co-processors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked
Crypto2304T, or with both crypto co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior
to the production of the hardware. In case the SCP is blocked, no AES and DES computation supported by
hardware is possible. In case the Crypto2304T is blocked, no RSA and EC computation – in any of the version
stated in chapter 1.1 – supported by hardware is possible. No accessibility of the deselected cryptographic co-
processors is without impact on any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the situation
where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic co-processors.
End of note.

Note 7:
In case the SCP is blocked, no AES, no DES and no Cipher based Message Authentication Code (CMAC by SCL)
computation supported by hardware is possible and thus the CIPURSE™ CL and SCL usage is not possible. This is
regardless of the library version chosen.
End of note.

 O.Mem Access                Area based Memory Access Control
                             The TOE must provide the Smartcard Embedded Software with the capability to
                             define restricted access memory areas. The TOE must then enforce the
                             partitioning of such memory areas so that access of software to memory areas and
                             privilege levels is controlled as required, for example, in a multi-application
                             environment.

The additional functionality of a Loader as defined in the PP [9], section 7.3 requires to address the following
objective, as defined in the document “PP0084: Interpretation” [9.1].

below:

O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality Protection of the confidentiality of the TSF
                           The TOE must provide protection against disclosure of confidential operations of
                           the Security IC (loader, memory management unit …) through the use of a
                           dedicated code loaded on open samples.

 O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL              Authentication of entities
                              The CIPURSE™ CL must implement mutual authentication to establish a ready to

 O.Prot_Integrity             Integrity protection
                              The CIPURSE™ CL must implement integrity protection functionality for the user

 O.Prot_Confidentiality Confidentiality protection
                        The CIPURSE™ CL must protect the confidentiality of the user data to be

The security objectives for the security IC embedded software development environment and the operational
environment are defined in PP [9] section 4.2, 4.3, 7.2.1and 7.3.

For secure use of the CIPURSE™ CL it is essential that on user side the common secret is generated and stored in
an appropriate way and that integrity and confidentiality of this user secret is maintained. These preconditions
are treated in the PP [9] section 3.1 claims 67 and 68.

The operational environment of the TOE shall provide “Limitation of capability and blocking the Loader
“OE.Lim_Block_Loader”, “External entities authentication of the TOE “OE.TOE_Auth" and “Secure
communication and usage of the Loader “OE.Loader¬Usage” as specified below:

 OE.Lim_Block_Loader            Limitation of capability and blocking the Loader
                                The Composite Product Manufacturer will protect the Loader functionality
                                against misuse, limit the capability of the Loader and terminate irreversibly
                                the Loader after intended usage of the Loader.
 OE.TOE_Auth                    Authentication to external entities
                                The operational environment shall support the authentication verification
                                mechanism and know authentication reference data of the TOE.
 OE.Loader_Usage                Secure communication and usage of the Loader
                                The authorized user must support the trusted communication with the TOE by

End of note.


5.3            Security Objectives for the Environment
Since the CIPURSE™ CL requires the presence of a common secret on both communication entities an additional
objective for the environment is generated:
Following objectives are defined here.

                               Please refer to chapter 5.3.1 for clarification

Note 9:
The CIPURSE™ CL is a delivery option. In case the user has ordered the CIPURSE™ CL, the user is responsible to
implement the CIPURSE™ CL into his user software. In addition, the user has to generate and treat the common
secret in an appropriate way. The objective common secret is therefore similar to the OE.Resp-Appl. Anyhow,
processes and treatment is exclusively subject of the user and his logistic processes.
End of note.

Note 10:
If the user decides to use the integrity protection mode of the CIPURSE™ CL then the confidentiality of the user
data to be transferred is solely subject of the user.
End of note.

Note 11:
The CIPURSE™ CL as cryptographic functionality establishes a cryptographic secured communication channel
between two identified entities. Depending on the implementation and usage, the CIPURSE™ CL can act either

(1) These objectives are only valid if the TOE is delivered with active Flash Loader.


5.3.1          Clarification of “Treatment of User Data (OE.Resp-Appl)”
Regarding the cryptographic services this objective of the environment has to be clarified.
By definition cipher or plain text data and cryptographic keys are user data of the Composite TOE. The
Smartcard Embedded Software shall treat these data appropriately, use only proper secret keys (chosen from a
large key space) as input for the cryptographic function of the TOE and use keys and functions appropriately in
order to ensure the strength of cryptographic operation.
This means that keys are treated as confidential as soon as they are generated. The keys must be unique with a
very high probability, as well as cryptographically strong. For example, it must be ensured that it is beyond
practicality to derive the private key from a public key if asymmetric algorithms are used. If keys are imported
into the TOE and/or derived from other keys, quality and confidentiality must be maintained. This implies that
appropriate key management has to be realized in the environment.
Regarding the memory, software and firmware protection and the SFR and peripheral access rights handling
these objectives of the environment has to be clarified. The treatment of user data of the Composite TOE is also
required when a multi-application operating system is implemented as part of the Smartcard Embedded
Software on the TOE. In this case the multi-application operating system should not disclose security relevant
user data of one application to another application when it is processed or stored on the TOE.


5.3.2     Clarification of “Protection during Composite product Manufacturing
(OE.Process-Sec-IC)”
The protection during packaging, finishing and personalization includes also the personalization process (Flash
Loader) and the personalization data (TOE software components) during Phase 4, Phase 5 and Phase 6.

Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


 5.5           P.Add-Functions
The justification related to the security objective “Additional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions)”
is as follows: Since O.Add-Functions requires the TOE to implement exactly the same specific security
functionality as required by P.Add-Functions; the organizational security policy is covered by the objective.

Nevertheless the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing, O.Malfunction, O.Phys-Manipulation and
O.Leak-Forced define how to implement the specific security functionality required by P.Add-Functions. (Note
that these objectives support that the specific security functionality is provided in a secure way as expected from
P.Add-Functions.) Especially O.Leak-Inherent and O.Leak-Forced refer to the protection of confidential data
(User data of the Composite TOE or TSF data) in general. User data of the Composite TOE are also processed by
the specific security functionality required by P.Add-Functions.

The policy P.Add functions includes the function CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CCL). This functionality
implements the objectives O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL, O.Prot_Integrity and O.Prot_Confidentiality. The CIPURSE™
Cryptographic Library (CCL) first prepares and establishes a secure communication channel between two
authenticated entities. The mutual authentication means covers the objective O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL. The
implemented means of session key generation and integrity protection prepares for the confidential and
integrity protected exchange of user data between the two authenticated entities. Thus the objectives
O.Prot_Integrity and O.Prot_Confidentiality are covered too.

The policy P.Add functions includes the function Cipher base Message authentication code (CMAC). This
functionality is implemented by the optional software SCL and implements the option to protect the integrity of
a user data block with a message authentication code. The computing of the CMAC requires the use of either
AES or TDES, as outlined in the chapter P.Crypto-Service 5.9 and also implemented by the optional software
SCL.


 5.6           A.Key-Function
Compared to the PP [9] a further clarification has been made for the security objective “Treatment of user data
of the Composite TOE (OE.Resp-Appl)”: By definition cipher or plain text data and cryptographic keys are user
data of the Composite TOE. So, the Smartcard Embedded Software will protect such data if required and use
keys and functions appropriately in order to ensure the strength of cryptographic operation. Quality and
confidentiality must be maintained for keys that are imported and/or derived from other keys. This implies that
appropriate key management has to be realized in the environment. That is expressed by the assumption
A.Key—Function which is covered from OE.Resp–Appl. These measures make sure that the assumption
A.Resp-Appl is still covered by the security objective OE.Resp-Appl although additional functions are being
supported according to P.Add-Functions.

Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


 5.7           T.Mem-Access
Compared to the PP [9] an enhancement regarding memory area protection has been established. The clear
definition of privilege levels for operated software establishes the clear separation of different restricted memory
areas for running the firmware – regardless of the version in use -, downloading and/or running the operating
system and to establish a clear separation between different applications. Nevertheless, it is also possible to
define a shared memory section where separated applications may exchange defined data. The privilege levels
clearly define by using a hierarchical model the access right from one level to the other. These measures ensure
that the threat T.Mem-Access is clearly covered by the security objective O.Mem-Access.


 5.8           P.Ctrl_Loader, P.Lim_Block_Loader, T.Masquerade_TOE and
               T.Open_Samples_Diffusion
The PP [9] section 7.3 considers the life cycle phases of the TOE also with the organizational policy
P.Lim_Block_Loader and P.Ctlr_Loader as the TOE must be protected against unauthorized usage and control
and against download of malicious software before, during and after the user downloads his software. This is
formalized with the objectives O.Cap_Avail_Loader, O.Authentication and O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader requiring
authentication of the TOE to external entities and a trusted communication channel. The O.Authentication
implements a mutual authentication and involves the environment therefore.
And the policies cover also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must be
regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.
The implemented mutual authentication requires first to authenticate the TOE to the external user. This requires
also knowledge by the user about the sequence of the protocol, interpretation of the transferred data and how to
start the authentication of the TOE. This authentication mean counters the threat T.Masquerade_TOE as only
the genuine TOE is able to identify itself correctly to the enabled user, which covers O.Authentication.
The second step of the mutual authentications mean implements the authentication of the user to the TOE. Only
the user enabled to present the correct authentication data and knowing about the sequence, data
interpretation and signaling of the authentication to the TOE is able to proceed further on.
This enforces OE.TOE_Auth, requiring the support of the verification mechanism and known authentication
reference data by the operational environment.

It is normal business that products enabled for software download by the user are either on their way to the user
or are already stored at user premises. At both situations it cannot be excluded that an attacker could manage to
steal such products enabled for software downloads. The ability to download software on a chip without
operating system and/or application is defined as open sample.
This situation generates the threat T.Open_Samples_Diffusion which is defined as follows:
The download of analysis software could enable an attacker to characterize the product and to construct an
attack path out of the gained information.
This threat is countered by the Flash Loader by following rational:
As long as the Flash Loader is active, controlled usage to the Flash Loader functionality (P.Ctrl_Loader) is
enforced which protects the TOE from achieving the status of being an open sample. And more, even the
attacker could observe, meaning in the sense of measurements during, or induce faults during an authorized
download, the Flash Loader protects the user data of the download by confidentiality and integrity protection
means. The Flash Loader functionalities of mutual authentication, establishing a dedicated trusted
communication channel, the encryption and integrity protection means cover the objectives
O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality, O.Leak-Inherent and O.Leak-Forced.
The policy P.Ctrl_Loader covers also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must
be regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.

Note regarding the Flash Loader:

Public Security Target
Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


The algorithm strength of the Flash Loader has not been cryptographic-analytically evaluated by the BSI, as
Infineon has implemented a proprietary extension.
End of note.

The objective O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader Access control and authenticity for the Loader is covered by following
rational:
The identification of the communication entities of the Flash Loader requires the presence of dedicated
identification data for passing successfully the mutual authentication. This enforces the policy P.Ctrl_Loader
comprising the aspect of the mutual authentication. After successful authentication the user is enabled to
change the keys used for authentication and downloading the user data. This first user is defined as the
administrator. The TOE can then further be operated for example by a service partner who is defined as being
the Download Operator. The equal protecting means as for the Administrator apply here again but due to the
key change different roles are established. The Download Operator downloads then the encrypted user data
with the Flash Loader into the defined and accessible SOLID FLASH™ NVM area. This area is access protected by
the MMU.
The policy O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader covers also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it
must be regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.

This objective O.Leak-Inherent is covered with following rational:
This false download threat is countered with the mutual authentication mean as only the correct identified user
is able to download the user intended software and data. Since it is not practical for an attacker to authenticate
correctly a threatening download of attack software is countered. By that possible confidential user data already
stored on the TOE remain protected from disclosure by this method.
If the user is the attacker, or does not follow the user guidance, or bad designed user software implements
weaknesses, the user data remain protected anyway, since even after passing the mutual authentication of the
loader the download is conducted encrypted only. And even more, a different encryption is applied to store the
data in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. Since also the number of Flash Loader trials is limited even comprehensive
side channel analysis would not leave sufficient information to conduct a successful attack.
The implemented authentication means cover also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user
premises, as it must be regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.

This objective O.Leak-Forced is covered with following rational:
Another method to gain information is to force information leakage of confidential data processed in the TOE.
Such forcing requires malfunction or physical manipulation. Inducing errors of any kind during data processing
will be discovered by the Integrity Guard with high probability which leads to a security reset. Failures induced
during the mutual authentication or encrypted download process of the Flash Loader will also be discovered as
the perturbation of the sequences leads to fail of the process with trial counter decrement or a fail of the integrity
check of the downloaded data will occur. It would anyway not be practical to induce targeted errors as any
process managing data is protected due to the permanent and differently data encryption and integrity
protection on the TOE.
Physical static manipulation requires the presence of a worthwhile target. This is on one hand hard to identify
and would require intensive reverse engineering due to the topological means such as synthesis of the TOE and
other means. But, on the other hand, if we assume than an attacker could identify such spot, and the physical
preparation was successful too and thus it was possible to probe the targeted signal, then, even assumed the
attacker could analyze the traffic on the signal, the results would be worthless, since the signal data is encrypted
or masked. Thus, the data remains confidentiality protected even outside the TOE, since the analyst neither has
neither the encryption algorithm nor the key.
The Integrity Guard concept and encryption of memory contents are always present and cover also the
environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must be regardless in which environment the
Flash Loader is operated.

Public Security Target
Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


All requirements are fulfilled by the Flash Loader due the strong mutual authentication means enabling only the
authorized user for the download, due to the download of encrypted data only and due to the final locking
command to be applied by the user before delivery. As a consequence the operational environment objectives
OE.Lim_Block_Loader, OE.TOE_Auth and OE.Loader_Usage obligate the composite manufacturer to protect
the authentication data (e.g. keys) against misuse and limit the capability of the Loader.
In addition, the user guidance implements the obligation to permanent disable the Flash Loader prior delivery to
the end-user.

The package 1 defines the final locking of the Flash Loader prior delivery to the end-user and the usage in secure
environment. The package 2 defines that the Flash Loader can be used also in insecure environment. By claiming
both packages the user has the choice to apply the active Flash Loader either in insecure or in secure
environment and achieves by that a maximum of flexibility. Anyhow, the user is obligated to lock the Flash
Loader prior delivery to the end-user in both cases. This is an obligation implemented by the user guidance.
The Flash Loader provides the required functionality to be applied by the composite manufacturer for covering
these objectives.

The objectives O.Cap_Avail_Loader, O.Authentication, O.Loader_Usage and O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality and
the organizational policies P.Lim_Block_Loader and P.Ctlr_Loader as discussed in the PP [9] section 7.2 and 7.3
apply only at TOE products at the life cycle phase delivery, if these products come with activated Flash Loader
enabled for software or data download by the user. In other cases the Flash Loader is not available anymore and
the user software or data download is completed. Depending on the capabilities of the user software these
objectives may then reoccur as subject of the composite TOE.

 5.9          P.Crypto-Service
The PP [9] includes the organizational security policy P.Crypto-Service Cryptographic services of the TOE in a
different extend as it formalizes the objectives O.TDES and O.AES.
For the objective O.TDES a concrete standard reference (NIST) with operational modes is given the
implementation must follow and also the cryptographic key destruction is regulated. The implementation
complies to the given security functional requirements and the objective O.TDES is met.
For the objective O.AES a concrete standard reference (NIST) with a selection of key lengths is given the
implementation must follow and also the cryptographic key destruction is regulated. The implementation
complies to the given security functional requirements and the objective O.AES is met.
For the objective O.AES a concrete standard reference with an algorithm selection is given the implementation
must follow. The implementation complies to the given security functional requirements and the objective
O.AES is met.
The justification of the additional policy and the additional assumption show that they do not contradict to the
rationale already given in the Protection Profile for the assumptions, policy and threats defined there.

6.1           Component Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)
The security is strongly dependent on the correct operation of the security functions. Therefore, the TOE shall
support that particular security functions or mechanisms are tested in the operational phase (Phase 7). The tests
can be initiated by the Smartcard Embedded Software and/or by the TOE or is done automatically and
continuously.
Part 2 of the Common Criteria provides the security functional component “TSF testing (FPT_TST.1)”. The
component FPT_TST.1 provides the ability to test the TSF’s correct operation.
For the user it is important to know which security functions or mechanisms can be tested. The functional
component FPT_TST.1 does not mandate to explicitly specify the security functions being tested. In addition,
FPT_TST.1 requires verification of the integrity of TSF data and of the stored TSF executable code which might
violate the security policy. Therefore, the functional component ”Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)” of
the family TSF self-test has been newly created. This component allows that particular parts of the security
mechanisms and functions provided by the TOE are tested.

 6.1.1        Definition of FPT_TST.2
The functional component “Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)” has been newly created (Common Criteria
Part 2 extended). This component allows that particular parts of the security mechanisms and functions provided
by the TOE can be tested after TOE Delivery or are tested automatically and continuously during normal
operation transparent for the user.
This security functional component is used instead of the functional component FPT_TST.1 from Common
Criteria Part 2. For the user it is important to know which security functions or mechanisms can be tested. The
functional component FPT_TST.1 does not mandate to explicitly specify the security functions being tested. In
addition, FPT_TST.1 requires verifying the integrity of TSF data and stored TSF executable code which might
violate the security policy.
The functional component “Subset TOE testing (FPT_TST.2)” is specified as follows (Common Criteria Part 2
extended).

   (1) Applies in two alternative operation modes: one mode preserves integrity protected communication and
       the second preserves integrity and confidential communication. Choosing the mode is up to the user and
       his responsibility. For example, the integrity protected mode can be used at secure premises, i.e. where
       eavesdropping is no issue, and the second mode can be applied where the environment is out of control
       of the user.
   (2) These security functional requirements SFR apply only if the SCL- meaning one of the two alternatives -
       is on board of the delivered TOE products.
   (3) Note that the assignment of the in the table above selected SFRs to Flash Loader or CIPURSE™ CL do
       not implement an augmentation as the extension it is just to clarify the part of the TOE claiming the
       corresponding SFR.
   (4) All HSL versions implement tearing save behavior for the SOLID Flash™ NVM. Its features are close to
       physical SOLID Flash™ NVM behavior which is not part of the SPM. Therefore, the HSL functionality

Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)


All assignments and selections of the security functional requirements of the TOE are done in PP [9] and in the
following description.
Notes:
      The security functional requirements valid for the ACL in all alternative versions ACL-1 to ACL-3 are
         FCS_CKM.1/EC, FCS_CKM.1/RSA, FCS_COP.1/ECDH, FCS_COP.1/ECDSA and FCS_COP.1/RSA. These
         SFRs apply only if the corresponding asymmetric cryptographic library is on bard.
      The security functional requirements FMT_LIM.1/Loader, FMT_LIM.2/Loader, FIA_API.1, FTP_ITC.1,
         FDP_UCT.1, FDP_UIT.1, FDP_ACC.1/Loader and FDP_ACF.1/Loader applying only at TOE products
         coming with activated Flash Loader enabled for user data download. In other cases the Flash Loader is
         not available anymore and the user data download is completed. Depending on the capabilities of the
         user software these security functional requirements may then reoccur as subject of the composite TOE.

7.1.1.1        FCS_RNG
To define the IT security functional requirements of the TOE an additional family (FCS_RNG) of the Class FCS
(cryptographic support) is defined in the PP [9]. This family describes the functional requirements for random
number generation used for cryptographic purposes.

Please note that the national regulation are outlined in PP [9] chapter 7.5.1 and in AIS31 [13]. These regulations
apply for this TOE.

Note 12:
The functional requirements FCS_RNG.1/TRNG, FCS_RNG.1/HPRG, FCS_RNG.1/DRNG, FCS_RNG.1/KSG, are
iterations of the FCS_RNG.1 defined in the PP [9] according to “Anwendungshinweise und Interpretationen zum
Schema (AIS)” respectively “A proposal for: Functionality classes for random number generators” [13].
End of note.

Note 13:
The Physical True Random Number Generator PTRNG implements total failure test of the random source and a
continuous RNG test according to:
National Institute of Standards and Technology, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, Federal
Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS) 140-2, 2002-03-12, chapter 4.9.2.
End of note.

Together with the guidelines in [6] the hybrid PTRNG of this TOE provides random numbers conformant to
several quality metrics as defined in [13]. Depending on the user configuration the TOE provide the according
random number quality. For each addressed quality metric of [13] the definitions are made in the following
chapters.

of the version in use -, downloading and/or running the operating
system and to establish a clear separation between different applications. Nevertheless, it is also possible to
define a shared memory section where separated applications may exchange defined data. The privilege levels
clearly define by using a hierarchical model the access right from one level to the other. These measures ensure
that the threat T.Mem-Access is clearly covered by the security objective O.Mem-Access.


 5.8           P.Ctrl_Loader, P.Lim_Block_Loader, T.Masquerade_TOE and
               T.Open_Samples_Diffusion
The PP [9] section 7.3 considers the life cycle phases of the TOE also with the organizational policy
P.Lim_Block_Loader and P.Ctlr_Loader as the TOE must be protected against unauthorized usage and control
and against download of malicious software before, during and after the user downloads his software. This is
formalized with the objectives O.Cap_Avail_Loader, O.Authentication and O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader requiring
authentication of the TOE to external entities and a trusted communication channel. The O.Authentication
implements a mutual authentication and involves the environment therefore.
And the policies cover also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must be
regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.
The implemented mutual authentication requires first to authenticate the TOE to the external user. This requires
also knowledge by the user about the sequence of the protocol, interpretation of the transferred data and how to
start the authentication of the TOE. This authentication mean counters the threat T.Masquerade_TOE as only
the genuine TOE is able to identify itself correctly to the enabled user, which covers O.Authentication.
The second step of the mutual authentications mean implements the authentication of the user to the TOE. Only
the user enabled to present the correct authentication data and knowing about the sequence, data
interpretation and signaling of the authentication to the TOE is able to proceed further on.
This enforces OE.TOE_Auth, requiring the support of the verification mechanism and known authentication
reference data by the operational environment.

It is normal business that products enabled for software download by the user are either on their way to the user
or are already stored at user premises. At both situations it cannot be excluded that an attacker could manage to
steal such products enabled for software downloads. The ability to download software on a chip without
operating system and/or application is defined as open sample.
This situation generates the threat T.Open_Samples_Diffusion which is defined as follows:
The download of analysis software could enable an attacker to characterize the product and to construct an
attack path out of the gained information.
This threat is countered by the Flash Loader by following rational:
As long as the Flash Loader is active, controlled usage to the Flash Loader functionality (P.Ctrl_Loader) is
enforced which protects the TOE from achieving the status of being an open sample. And more, even the
attacker could observe, meaning in the sense of measurements during, or induce faults during an authorized
download, the Flash Loader protects the user data of the download by confidentiality and integrity protection
means. The Flash Loader functionalities of mutual authentication, establishing a dedicated trusted
communication channel, the encryption and integrity protection means cover the objectives
O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality, O.Leak-Inherent and O.Leak-Forced.
The policy P.Ctrl_Loader covers also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must
be regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.

The algorithm strength of the Flash Loader has not been cryptographic-analytically evaluated by the BSI, as
Infineon has implemented a proprietary extension.
End of note.

The objective O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader Access control and authenticity for the Loader is covered by following
rational:
The identification of the communication entities of the Flash Loader requires the presence of dedicated
identification data for passing successfully the mutual authentication. This enforces the policy P.Ctrl_Loader
comprising the aspect of the mutual authentication. After successful authentication the user is enabled to
change the keys used for authentication and downloading the user data. This first user is defined as the
administrator. The TOE can then further be operated for example by a service partner who is defined as being
the Download Operator. The equal protecting means as for the Administrator apply here again but due to the
key change different roles are established. The Download Operator downloads then the encrypted user data
with the Flash Loader into the defined and accessible SOLID FLASH™ NVM area. This area is access protected by
the MMU.
