Table of figures
Figure 1: TOE ......................................................................................................12
Figure 2:ssumed to protect the integrity of the input it provides to the TOE
signature creation function as being consistent with the user data authorised for signing by the signatory.
Unless implicitly known to the TOE, the SCndii Acates the kind of the signing input (as DTBS/R) it provides
and computes any hash value required. The TOE may augment the DTBS/R with signature parameters it
stores and then computes a hash value over the input as needed by the kind of input and the used crypto-
graphic algorithm.
The TOE stores signatory reference authentication data (RAD) to authenticate a user as its signatory. The
RAD is a password (e.g. PIN), a biometric template or a combination of these. The TOE protects the confi-
dentiality and integrity of the RAD. The TOE may provide a user interface to directly receive verification
authentication data (VAD) from the user, alternatively, the TOE receive the VAD from the signature creation
application (SCA). If the signature creation application handles, is requesting or obtaining a VAD from the
user, it is assumed to protect the confidentiality and integrity of this data.
A certification service provider and a SSCD-provisioning service provider interact with the TOE in the secure
preparation environment to perform any preparation function of the TOE required before control of the
TOE is given to the legitimate user. These functions may include:
    ÔÇ∑   initialising the RAD,
    ÔÇ∑   generating a key pair,

2 At a pure functional level the SSCD creates a digital signature; for an implementation of the SSCD, in that
meeting the requirements of this PP and with the key certificate created as specified in the Directive, Annex
I, the result of the signing process can be used as to create a qualified electronic signature.
3Please note that while this security target - following the according protection profile BSI-CC-PP-0075-
2012-MA-01 - references the [Directive], it also incorporates the requirements of the eIDAS regulation [Re-
gulation] and the according commission implementing regulation [Implementing].

    ÔÇ∑     storing personal information of the legitimate user.
In the case at hand the TOE is a smart card or electronic ID document. In this case a smart-card terminal
may be deployed that provides the required secure environment to handle a request for signatory authori-
zation. A signature can be obtained on a document prepared by a signature-creation application component
running on personal computer connected to the card terminal. The signature creation application, after
presenting the document to the user and after obtaining the authorization PIN initiates the electronic sig-
nature creation function of the smart card through the terminal.
The RAD verification is typically performed by direct PIN verification (VERIFY PIN command); to further pro-
tect the RAD (password or PIN) ‚Äì especially in a contactless application scenario ‚Äì the Password Authenti-
cated Connection Establishmanet (PACE) protocol according to [TR03110] can be used.

1.4.6 Major security features of the TOE
The TOE provides the following TOE security functionalities:
    ÔÇ∑     TSF_Access manages the access to objects (files, directories, data and secrets) stored in the applet‚Äôs
          file system. It also controls write access of initialization, pre-personalization and personalization
          data4.
    ÔÇ∑     TSF_Admin manages the storage of manufacturing data, pre-personalization data and personaliza-
          tion data.
    ÔÇ∑     TSF_Secret ensures secure management of secrets such as cryptographic keys. This covers secure
          key storage, access to keys as well as secure key deletion. These mechanisms are mainly provided
          by TSF_OS.
    ÔÇ∑     TSF_Crypto performs high level cryptographic operations. The implementation is mainly based on
          the Security Functionalities provided by TSF_OS.
    ÔÇ∑     TSF_SecureMessaging realizes a secure communication channel.
    ÔÇ∑     TSF_Auth realizes two authentication mechanisms: PIN verification and alternatively authentication
          with the PACE protocol.
    ÔÇ∑     TSF_Integrity protects the integrity of internal applet data like the Access control lists.
    ÔÇ∑     TSF_OS contains all security functionalities provided by the certified platform (IC, Javacard opera-
          tion system). The cryptographic operations needed for this TOE are provided by the platform:
              o   Electronic signature-generation with RSA and key sizes of 2000 up to 4096 bit in steps of 1
                  bit, or ECDSA with key sizes of key sizes of 160 bit to 521 bit in steps of one bit.
              o   Secure messaging with AES (128, 192 or 256 bit key length).
              o   PACE authentication with key lengths of 160 bit to 521 bit in steps of one bit (ECC).

1.4.7 TOE life cycle
This paragraph is based on the protection profile [PP0075].

1.4.7.1    General



4 In the context of this security target the three categories are defined as follows: initialization comprises
the preparation of the TOE based on proprietary operations of the platform with the Java Card operation
system; pre-personalization comprises the configuration of the card manager and security domains as well
as the generation of applet instances using Global Platform commands. Personalization is carried out after-
wards using commands of the applet layer of the TOE.

Figure 3: Example of TOE lifecycle following figure 1 of [PP0075]. Note that import of certificate info during
TOE preparation and deletion of certificate info when SCD is destroyed are optional. The delivery to the
SSCD provisioning service after the development phase is also the end of the scope of the certification ac-
cording to Common Criteria.

The operational usage of the TOE comprises the preparation stage and the operational use stage. The TOE
operational use stage begins when the signatory has obtained both the VAD and the TOE. Enabling the TOE
for signing requires at least one set of SCD stored in its memory.
Figure 3 shows an example of the lifecycle where an SCD or SCD/SVD pair is imported from SSCD-
provisioning service before delivery to the signatory. The lifecycle may allow import of SCD or SCD/SVD key
pairs after delivery to the signatory as well.
The TOE life cycle ends when all keys stored in it have been rendered permanently unusable. Rendering a
key in the SSCD unusable may include deletion of any stored corresponding certificate info. The lifecycle
may allow generation of SCD or SCD/SVD key pairs after delivery to the signatory as well.

1.4.7.2   Preparation stage
The preparation phase of the TOE lifecycle is processing the TOE from the customer's acceptance of the
delivered TOE to a state ready for operation by the signatory. The customer receiving the TOE from the

manufacturer is the SSCD-provisioning service that prepares and provides the SSCD to subscribers. The
preparation includes
    ÔÇ∑     Create and configure the signature application according to AGD_PRE; this step involves applet
          instanciation as well as creation of the file system (card profile).5
    ÔÇ∑     The personalisation of the TOE for use by the signatory, i.e. the installation of the RAD in the TOE
          and handover of VAD to the signatory.
    ÔÇ∑     The initialisation of the TOE, i.e. the CSP generates the SCD/SVD pair by means of a SCD/SVD gen-
          eration device, loads the SCD to the TOE, and sends the SVD to the CGA. The TOE may import and
          store the SCD/SVD pair.
    ÔÇ∑     The generation of the (qualified) certificate containing among others (cf. [1], Annex II)
              a) the SVD which correspond to SCD under the control of the signatory;
              b) the name of the signatory or a pseudonym, which is to be identified as such,
              c) an indication of the beginning and end of the period of validity of the certificate.

    ÔÇ∑     The preparation may include optional loading of the certificate info into the SSCD for signatory con-
          venience.
The CSP generates a SCD/SVD pair and imports SCD, and optionally also SVD, into the SSCD. The CSP ensures
          a) the correspondence between SCD and SVD,
          b) that algorithm and key size for the SVD are appropriate.

Please take note that verifying whether the claimed identity of the signer originates from that given SSCD
has to be done by the CSP operating the CGA.
If the TOE is used for creation of advanced electronic signatures, the certificate links the signature verifica-
tion data to the person (i.e. the signatory) and confirms the identity of that person (cf. [Directive], article 2,
Clause 9).
This security target requires the TOE to provide mechanisms for import of SCD, implementation of the SCD
and personalisation. The environment is assumed to protect all other processes for TOE preparation like
SCD transfer between the SCD/SVD generation device and the TOE, and SVD transfer between the SCD/SVD
generation device and the CGA. The CSP may export the SVD to the TOE for internal use by the TOE (e.g.,
self-test).
Before generating a (qualified) certificate, the CSP is expected to first store the SCD in a SSCD. A secure
channel with the TOE may be used to support this, by ensuring integrity of the SCD during transmission to
the TOE.

1.4.7.3    Operational use stage
In this lifecycle stage the signatory can use the TOE to create advanced electronic signatures.
The operational phase of the TOE starts when at least one SCD/SVD pair is generated by the CSP and the
SCD is imported into the SSCD and when the signatory takes control over the TOE and makes the SCD oper-
ational. The signatory uses the TOE with a trustworthy SCA in a secured environment only. The SCA is as-
sumed to protect the DTBS/R during the transmission to the TOE.




5 This preparation step has been added to the life cycle definition of the underlying Protection Profile and
is necessary to provide the basic functionality (i.e. application and file system) for the following steps. It
may be performed by the SSCD-provisioning service provider directly or by a separate entity (card manu-
facturer).

                                                    13 of 82
NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 / SSCD with Key Import Security Target Lite


The signatory can also interact with the SSCD to perform management tasks, e.g. reset a RAD value or use
counter if the password/PIN in the reference data has been lost or blocked. Such management tasks require
a secure environment.
The signatory can render an SCD in the TOE permanently unusable. Rendering the last SCD in the TOE per-
manently unusable ends the life of the TOE as SSCD.
The TOE may support functions to generate additional signing keys. If the TOE supports these functions it
will support further functions to securely obtain certificates for the new keys. For an additional key the
signatory may be allowed to choose the kind of certificate (qualified, or not) to obtain for the SVD of the
new key. The signatory may also be allowed to choose some of the data in the certificate request for in-
stance to use a pseudonym instead of the legal name in the certificate5. If the conditions to obtain a quali-
fied certificate are met, the new key can also be used to create advanced electronic signatures. The optional
TOE functions for additional key generation and certification may require additional security functions in
the TOE and an interaction with the SSCD-provisioning service provider in an environment that is secure.
The TOE life cycle as SSCD ends when all SCD stored in the TOE are destructed. This may include deletion of
the corresponding certificates.

                       The IC hardware platform P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF is a microcontroller
                       incorporating a central processing unit, memories accessible via a Memory Management
                       Unit, cryptographic coprocessors, other security components and two communication
                       interfaces. The central processing unit supports a 32-/24-/16-/8-bit instruction set optimized
                       for smart card applications, which is a super set of the 80C51 family instruction set. The first
                       and in some cases the second byte of an instruction are used for operation encoding. On-
                       chip memories are ROM, RAM and EEPROM. The non-volatile EEPROM can be used as
                       data or program memory. It consists of high reliable memory cells, which guarantee data
                       integrity. The EEPROM is optimized for applications requiring reliable non-volatile data
                       storage for data and program code. EEPROM double read function is included for correct
                       memory readout. Dedicated security functionality protects the contents of all memories.
                       The security functionality of the TOE is designed to act as an integral part of a complete
                       security system in order to strengthen the design as a whole. Several security mechanisms
                       are completely implemented in and controlled by the TOE. Other security mechanisms allow
                       for configuration or even require handling of exceptions by the Security IC Embedded
                       Software. The different CPU modes and the Memory Management Unit support the
                       implementation of multi-application projects using the P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF.
                       A Security IC must provide high security in particular when being used in the banking and
                       finance market, in electronic commerce or in governmental applications because the TOE
                       is intended to be used in a potential insecure environment. Hence the TOE shall maintain
                           ‚Ä¢ the integrity and the confidentiality of code and data stored in its memories and
                           ‚Ä¢ the different CPU modes with the related capabilities for configuration and memory
                             access and
                           ‚Ä¢ the integrity, the correct operation and the confidentiality of security functionality
                             provided by the TOE.
                       This is ensured by the construction of the TOE and its security functionality.
                       P60D024/016/012yVB(Y/Z/A)/yVF basically provides a hardware platform for an
                       implementation of a smart card application with
                           ‚Ä¢ functionality to calculate the Data Encryption Standard (Triple-DES) with up to three
                             keys,
                           ‚Ä¢ functionality to calculate the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with different key
                             lengths,
                           ‚Ä¢ support for large integer arithmetic operations like multiplication, addition and logical
                             operations, which are suitable for public key cryptography and elliptic curve
                             cryptography,
                           ‚Ä¢ a True Random Number Generator,
                           ‚Ä¢ memory management control,
                           ‚Ä¢ cyclic redundancy check (CRC) calculation,
                           ‚Ä¢ ISO/IEC 7816 contact interface with UART,
                           ‚Ä¢ ISO/IEC 14443 A contactless interface.
                       In addition, several security mechanisms are implemented to ensure proper operation as
                       well as integrity and confidentiality of stored data. For example, this includes security
                       mechanisms for memory protection and security exceptions as well as sensors, which allow

                       The TOE consists of the IC hardware platform and Security IC Dedicated Software as
                       composed of Security IC Dedicated Test Software and Security IC Dedicated Support
                       Software. The Security IC Dedicated Test Software contains the Test-ROM Software; the
                       Security IC Dedicated Support Software contains the Boot-ROM Software and the
                       Firmware Operating System.All other software is called Security IC Embedded Software.
                       The Security IC Embedded Software is not part of the TOE.
                       The IC Dedicated Support Software consists of Boot-ROM Software controlling the boot
                       process of the hardware platform and the Firmware Operating System which can be called
                       by the Security IC Embedded Software.
                       The Firmware Operating System for the hardware platform is called the Plain Firmware
                       Operating System (FOS-Plain) and the Firmware Operating System for the MIFARE
                       Software Emulation is called the Emulation Firmware Operating System (FOS- Emu).
                       The FOS-Plain provides an interface for programming of the internal EEPROM memory,
                       which is mandatory for use by the Security IC Embedded Software when programming the
                       EEPROM memory. Furthermore FOS-Plain provides an interface for the Post Delivery
                       Configuration functionality.
                       All configurations other than P60D024/016/012P include emulation MIFARE Plus
                       MF1PLUSx0 or MIFARE DESFire EV1 in the FOS-Emu. These emulations are represented
                       by the term MIFARE Software in this document. Note that MIFARE Software is not part of
                       the TOE (see Fig 2).

4.3.2          Note regarding CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL
The CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL as cryptographic functionality establishes a cryptographic secured communication channel
between two identified entities. Depending on the implementation and usage, the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL can act either
in the PICC or in the PCD role. In any case the secrets applied for establishing and usage of the secured channel
must be treated in an appropriate way by both entities PICC and PCD.
This means that it is essential on user side that the critical data for establishing this cryptographic secured
communication channel is generated and stored in an appropriate way and that integrity and confidentiality is
maintained.
These preconditions are treated in the PP [9] section 3.1 claims 67 and 68, and are the reason for not placing an
assumption here.

Note 4:
The objectives O.Cap_Avail_Loader, O. Authentication, O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader and O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality
apply only at TOE products coming with activated Flash Loader enabled for software or data download by the
user. In other cases the Flash Loader is not available anymore and the user software or data download is
completed. Depending on the capabilities of the user software these objectives may then reoccur as subject of
the composite TOE.
End of note.

The TOE provides ‚ÄúAdditional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions)‚Äù as specified below.

 O.Add-Functions              Additional Specific Security Functionality
                              The TOE must provide the following specific security functionality to the
                              Smartcard Embedded Software:
                                 ÔÇ∑ Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA)
                                 ÔÇ∑ Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC)
                                 ÔÇ∑ CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ Cryptography
                                 ÔÇ∑ Cipher base Message authentication code (CMAC)

Note 5:
The cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL and the Toolbox library are delivery options, regardless of the
version chosen. Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations of or even without these libraries. In the
case of coming without one or any combination of the cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL the TOE does
not provide the Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC) and/or CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ Cryptographic Library and/or Cipher based Message
Authentication Code (CMAC by the SCL-1).
The Toolbox Library is no cryptographic library, provides no additional specific security functionality and thus the
Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
End of note.

Note 6:
This TOE can come with both crypto co-processors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked
Crypto2304T, or with both crypto co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior
to the production of the hardware. In case the SCP is blocked, no AES and DES computation supported by
hardware is possible. In case the Crypto2304T is blocked, no RSA and EC computation ‚Äì in any of the version
stated in chapter 1.1 ‚Äì supported by hardware is possible. No accessibility of the deselected cryptographic co-
processors is without impact on any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the situation
where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic co-processors.
End of note.

Note 7:
In case the SCP is blocked, no AES, no DES and no Cipher based Message Authentication Code (CMAC by SCL)
computation supported by hardware is possible and thus the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL and SCL usage is not possible. This is
regardless of the library version chosen.
End of note.

The TOE shall provide ‚ÄúArea based Memory Access Control (O.Mem-Access)‚Äù as specified below.

 O.Mem Access                Area based Memory Access Control
                             The TOE must provide the Smartcard Embedded Software with the capability to
                             define restricted access memory areas. The TOE must then enforce the

                             privilege levels is controlled as required, for example, in a multi-application
                             environment.

The additional functionality of a Loader as defined in the PP [9], section 7.3 requires to address the following
objective, as defined in the document ‚ÄúPP0084: Interpretation‚Äù [9.1].

                              any other communication between the two entities is applied.

 O.Prot_Integrity             Integrity protection
                              The CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL must implement integrity protection functionality for the user

 O.Prot_Confidentiality Confidentiality protection
                        The CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL must protect the confidentiality of the user data to be

5.2            Security Objectives from PP for development and environment
The security objectives for the security IC embedded software development environment and the operational
environment are defined in PP [9] section 4.2, 4.3, 7.2.1and 7.3.

For secure use of the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL it is essential that on user side the common secret is generated and stored in
an appropriate way and that integrity and confidentiality of this user secret is maintained. These preconditions
are treated in the PP [9] section 3.1 claims 67 and 68.

The operational environment of the TOE shall provide ‚ÄúLimitation of capability and blocking the Loader
‚ÄúOE.Lim_Block_Loader‚Äù, ‚ÄúExternal entities authentication of the TOE ‚ÄúOE.TOE_Auth" and ‚ÄúSecure
communication and usage of the Loader ‚ÄúOE.Loader¬¨Usage‚Äù as specified below:

 OE.Lim_Block_Loader            Limitation of capability and blocking the Loader
                                The Composite Product Manufacturer will protect the Loader functionality
                                against misuse, limit the capability of the Loader and terminate irreversibly
                                the Loader after intended usage of the Loader.
 OE.TOE_Auth                    Authentication to external entities
                                The operational environment shall support the authentication verification
                                mechanism and know authentication reference data of the TOE.
 OE.Loader_Usage                Secure communication and usage of the Loader
                                The authorized user must support the trusted communication with the TOE by
                                confidentiality protection and authenticity proof of the data to be loaded and
                                fulfilling the access conditions required by the Loader.
 OE.Process-Sec-IC              Protection during composite product manufacturing
                                The protection during packaging, finishing and personalization includes also
                                the personalization process (Flash Loader) and the personalization data (TOE
                                software components) during Phase 4, Phase 5 and Phase 6.

Note 8:
The objectives OE.Lim_Block_Loader, OE.TOE_Auth, OE.Loader_Usage and OE.Process-Sec-IC for the
development and operation environment apply only at TOE products coming with activated Flash Loader
enabled for user data download. In other cases the Flash Loader is not available anymore and the user data
download is completed. Depending on the capabilities of the user software this objective may then reoccur as
subject of the composite TOE.
End of note.


5.3            Security Objectives for the Environment
Since the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL requires the presence of a common secret on both communication entities an additional
objective for the environment is generated:
Following objectives are defined here.

 OE.Resp-Appl                  Treatment of User data of the Composite TOE
                               Please refer to chapter 5.3.1 for clarification

Note 9:
The CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL is a delivery option. In case the user has ordered the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL, the user is responsible to
implement the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL into his user software. In addition, the user has to generate and treat the common
secret in an appropriate way. The objective common secret is therefore similar to the OE.Resp-Appl. Anyhow,
processes and treatment is exclusively subject of the user and his logistic processes.
End of note.

Note 10:
If the user decides to use the integrity protection mode of the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL then the confidentiality of the user
data to be transferred is solely subject of the user.
End of note.

Note 11:
The CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL as cryptographic functionality establishes a cryptographic secured communication channel
between two identified entities. Depending on the implementation and usage, the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL can act either
in the PICC or in the PCD role. In any case the secrets applied for establishing and usage of the secured channel
must be treated in an appropriate way by both entities PICC and PCD.
This means that it is essential on user side that the critical data for establishing this cryptographic secured
communication channel is generated and stored in an appropriate way and that integrity and confidentiality is
maintained.
These preconditions are treated in the PP [9] section 3.1 claims 67 and 68, and are the reason for not placing an
objective for the environment here.
End of note.

(1) These objectives are only valid if the TOE is delivered with active Flash Loader.


5.3.1          Clarification of ‚ÄúTreatment of User Data (OE.Resp-Appl)‚Äù
Regarding the cryptographic services this objective of the environment has to be clarified.
By definition cipher or plain text data and cryptographic keys are user data of the Composite TOE. The
Smartcard Embedded Software shall treat these data appropriately, use only proper secret keys (chosen from a
large key space) as input for the cryptographic function of the TOE and use keys and functions appropriately in
order to ensure the strength of cryptographic operation.
This means that keys are treated as confidential as soon as they are generated. The keys must be unique with a
very high probability, as well as cryptographically strong. For example, it must be ensured that it is beyond
practicality to derive the private key from a public key if asymmetric algorithms are used. If keys are imported
into the TOE and/or derived from other keys, quality and confidentiality must be maintained. This implies that
appropriate key management has to be realized in the environment.
Regarding the memory, software and firmware protection and the SFR and peripheral access rights handling
these objectives of the environment has to be clarified. The treatment of user data of the Composite TOE is also
required when a multi-application operating system is implemented as part of the Smartcard Embedded
Software on the TOE. In this case the multi-application operating system should not disclose security relevant
user data of one application to another application when it is processed or stored on the TOE.


5.3.2     Clarification of ‚ÄúProtection during Composite product Manufacturing
(OE.Process-Sec-IC)‚Äù
The protection during packaging, finishing and personalization includes also the personalization process (Flash
Loader) and the personalization data (TOE software components) during Phase 4, Phase 5 and Phase 6.

Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


 5.5           P.Add-Functions
The justification related to the security objective ‚ÄúAdditional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions)‚Äù
is as follows: Since O.Add-Functions requires the TOE to implement exactly the same specific security
functionality as required by P.Add-Functions; the organizational security policy is covered by the objective.

Nevertheless the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing, O.Malfunction, O.Phys-Manipulation and
O.Leak-Forced define how to implement the specific security functionality required by P.Add-Functions. (Note
that these objectives support that the specific security functionality is provided in a secure way as expected from
P.Add-Functions.) Especially O.Leak-Inherent and O.Leak-Forced refer to the protection of confidential data
(User data of the Composite TOE or TSF data) in general. User data of the Composite TOE are also processed by
the specific security functionality required by P.Add-Functions.

The policy P.Add functions includes the function CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ Cryptographic Library (CCL). This functionality
implements the objectives O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL, O.Prot_Integrity and O.Prot_Confidentiality. The CIPURSE‚Ñ¢
Cryptographic Library (CCL) first prepares and establishes a secure communication channel between two
authenticated entities. The mutual authentication means covers the objective O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL. The
implemented means of session key generation and integrity protection prepares for the confidential and
integrity protected exchange of user data between the two authenti        Assets regarding the Threats
The primary assets concern the User data which includes the user data of the Composite TOE as well as program
code (Security IC Embedded Software) stored and in operation and the provided security services. These assets
have to be protected while being executed and or processed and on the other hand, when the TOE is not in
operation.
This leads to four primary assets with its related security concerns:
    ÔÇ∑/ SC1 integrity of user data of the Composite TOE
    ÔÇ∑ SC2 confidentiality of user data of the Composite TOE being stored in the TOE‚Äôs protected memory
        areas
    ÔÇ∑ SC3 correct operation of the security services provided by the TOE for the Security IC Embedded
        Software
    ÔÇ∑ SC4 continuous availability of random numbers
SC4 is an additional security service provided by this TOE which is the availability of random numbers. These
random numbers are generated either by a true random number or a deterministic random number generator or
CC Document                                               44                                                        1.8

by both, when a true random number is used as seed for the deterministic random number generator. Note that
the generation of random numbers is a requirement of the PP [9].
To be able to protect the listed assets the TOE shall protect its security functionality as well. Therefore critical
information about the TOE shall be protected. Critical information includes:
     ÔÇ∑ logical design data, physical design data, IC Dedicated Software, and configuration data
     ÔÇ∑ Initialization Data and Pre-personalization Data, specific development aids, test and characterization
        related data, material for software development support, and reticles.
The information and material produced and/or processed by the TOE Manufacturer in the TOE development and
production environment (Phases 2 up to TOE Delivery) can be grouped as follows:
     ÔÇ∑ logical design data,
     ÔÇ∑ physical design data,
     ÔÇ∑ IC Dedicated Software, Security IC Embedded Software, Initialization Data and Pre-personalization
        Data,
     ÔÇ∑ specific development aids,
     ÔÇ∑ test and characterization related data,
     ÔÇ∑ material for software development support, and
     ÔÇ∑ reticles and products in any form
as long as they are generated, stored, or processed by the TOE Manufacturer.
For details see PP [9] section 3.1.


4.2            Organizational Security Policies
The TOE has to be protected during the first phases of their lifecycle (phases 2 up to TOE delivery which can be
after phase 3 or phase 4). Later on each variant of the TOE has to protect itself. The organizational security policy
according to PP [9] covers this aspect.

 P.Process-TOE              Identification during TOE Development and Production
                            An accurate identification must be established for the TOE. This requires that each
                            instantiation of the TOE carries this unique identification.

Due to the augmentations of PP [9] and the chosen packages additional policies are introduced and described in
the next chapter.

4.2.1          Augmented Organizational Security Policy
Due to the augmentations of the PP [9] and the chosen packages additional policies are introduced.
The TOE provides specific security functionality, which can be used by the Smartcard Embedded Software. In the
following specific security functionality is listed which is not derived from threats identified for the TOE‚Äôs
environment because it can only be decided in the context of the smartcard application, against which threats
the Smartcard Embedded Software will use the specific security functionality.
The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the policy ‚ÄúAdditional Specific Security Functionality
(P.Add-Functions)‚Äù as specified below.

P.Add-Functions                   Additional Specific Security Functionality
                                  The TOE shall provide the following specific security functionality to the
                                  Smartcard Embedded Software:
                                     ÔÇ∑ Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA)
                                     ÔÇ∑ Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC)
                                     ÔÇ∑ CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ Cryptographic Library (CCL)
                                     ÔÇ∑ Cipher based Message Authentication Code (CMAC by the SCL-1)

Note 2:
The cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL, and the Toolbox library as stated in chapter 1.1 are delivery
options. Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations of or even without these libraries. In the case of
coming without one or any combination of the cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL, the TOE does not
provide the Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or Elliptic
Curve Cryptography (EC) and/or CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ Cryptographic Library and/or Cipher based Message Authentication
Code (CMAC by SCL-1).
The Toolbox Library is no cryptographic library, provides no additional specific security functionality and thus the
Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
End of note.

The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the organizational security policy ‚ÄúCryptographic services of the
TOE (P.Crypto-Service)‚Äù as specified below:

 P.Crypto-Service              Cryptographic services of the TOE
                               The TOE provides secure hardware based cryptographic services for the IC
                               Embedded Software.
                                  ÔÇ∑ Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES)
                                  ÔÇ∑ Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

Note 3:
This TOE can come with both cryptographic coprocessors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked
Crypto2304T, or with both crypto co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior
to the production of the hardware. In case the SCP is blocked, no AES and DES respectively CMAC computation
supported by hardware or SCL is possible. In case the Crypto2304T is blocked, no RSA and EC computation ‚Äì of
any version as stated in chapter 1.1 - supported by hardware is possible. No accessibility of the deselected
cryptographic co-processors is without impact on any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to
the situation where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic co-processors.

The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the organizational security policy ‚ÄúLimiting and Blocking the Loader
Functionality (P.Lim_Block_Loader)‚Äù as specified below:

 P.Lim_Block_Loader             Limiting and Blocking the Loader Functionality
                                The composite manufacturer uses the Loader for loading of Security IC
                                Embedded Software, user data of the Composite Product or IC Dedicated
                                Support Software in charge of the IC Manufacturer. He limits the capability
                                and blocks the availability of the Loader in order to protect stored data from
                                disclosure and manipulation.
 P.Ctrl_Loader                  Controlled usage to Loader Functionality
                                Authorized user controls the usage of the Loader functionality in order to
                                protect stored and loaded user data from disclosure and manipulation.



4.3           Assumptions
The TOE assumptions on the operational environment are defined and described in PP [9] section 3.4.
The assumptions concern the phases where the TOE has left the chip manufacturer.
The support of cipher schemas requires an additional assumption.

 A.Process-Sec-IC                Protection during Packaging, Finishing and Personalization
                                 It is assumed that security procedures are used after delivery of the TOE by
                                 the TOE Manufacturer up to delivery to the end-consumer to maintain
                                 confidentiality and integrity of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test
                                 data (to prevent any possible copy, modification, retention, theft or
                                 unauthorized use).
 A.Resp-Appl                     Treatment of User data of the Composite TOE
                                 All User data of the Composite TOE are owned by Security IC Embedded
                                 Software. Therefore, it must be assumed that security relevant User data of
                                 the Composite TOE (especially cryptographic keys) are treated by the
                                 Security IC Embedded Software as defined for its specific application context.


4.3.1         Augmented Assumptions
The developer of the Smartcard Embedded Software must ensure the appropriate ‚ÄúUsage of Key-dependent
Functions (A.Key-Function)‚Äù while developing this software in Phase 1 as specified below.

 A.Key-Function               Usage of Key-dependent Functions
                              Key-dependent functions (if any) shall be implemented in the Smartcard
                              Embedded Software in a way that they are not susceptible to leakage attacks
                              (as described under T.Leak-Inherent and T.Leak-Forced).

Note that here the routines which may compromise keys when being executed are part of the Smartcard
Embedded Software. In contrast to this the threats T.Leak-Inherent and T.Leak-Forced address (i) the
cryptographic routines which are part of the TOE. For details please refer to PP [9] section 3.4.

4.3.2          Note regarding CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL
The CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL as cryptographic functionality establishes a cryptographic secured communication channel
between two identified entities. Depending on the implementation and usage, the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL can act either
in the PICC or in the PCD role. In any case the secrets applied for establishing and usage of the secured channel
must be treated in an appropriate way by both entities PICC and PCD.
This means that it is essential on user side that the critical data for establishing this cryptographic secured
communication channel is generated and stored in an appropriate way and that integrity and confidentiality is
maintained.
These preconditions are treated in the PP [9] section 3.1 claims 67 and 68, and are the reason for not placing an
assumption here.

The TOE shall provide ‚ÄúArea based Memory Access Control (O.Mem-Access)‚Äù as specified below.

 O.Mem Access                Area based Memory Access Control
                             The TOE must provide the Smartcard Embedded Software with the capability to
                             define restricted access memory areas. The TOE must then enforce the
                             partitioning of such memory areas so that access of software to memory areas and
                             privilege levels is controlled as required, for example, in a multi-application
                             environment.

The additional functionality of a Loader as defined in the PP [9], section 7.3 requires to address the following
objective, as defined in the document ‚ÄúPP0084: Interpretation‚Äù [9.1].
The TOE shall provide ‚ÄúProtection of the confidentiality of the TSF (O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality)‚Äù as specified
below:

O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality Protection of the confidentiality of the TSF

5.2            Security Objectives from PP for development and environment
The security objectives for the security IC embedded software development environment and the operational
environment are defined in PP [9] section 4.2, 4.3, 7.2.1and 7.3.

For secure use of the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL it is essential that on user side the common secret is generated and stored in
an appropriate way and that integrity and confidentiality of this user secret is maintained. These preconditions
are treated in the PP [9] section 3.1 claims 67 and 68.

The operational environment of the TOE shall provide ‚ÄúLimitation of capability and blocking the Loader
‚ÄúOE.Lim_Block_Loader‚Äù, ‚ÄúExternal entities authentication of the TOE ‚ÄúOE.TOE_Auth" and ‚ÄúSecure
communication and usage of the Loader ‚ÄúOE.Loader¬¨Usage‚Äù as specified below:

 OE.Lim_Block_Loader            Limitation of capability and blocking the Loader
                                The Composite Product Manufacturer will protect the Loader functionality
                                against misuse, limit the capability of the Loader and terminate irreversibly
                                the Loader after intended usage of the Loader.
 OE.TOE_Auth                    Authentication to external entities
                                The operational environment shall support the authentication verification
                                mechanism and know authentication reference data of the TOE.
 OE.Loader_Usage                Secure communication and usage of the Loader
                                The authorized user must support the trusted communication with the TOE by
                                confidentiality protection and authenticity proof of the data to be loaded and
                                fulfilling the access conditions required by the Loader.
 OE.Process-Sec-IC              Protection during composite product manufacturing
                                The protection during packaging, finishing and personalization includes also
                                the personalization process (Flash Loader) and the personalization data (TOE
                                software components) during Phase 4, Phase 5 and Phase 6.

Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


Note 8:
The objectives OE.Lim_Block_Loader, OE.TOE_Auth, OE.Loader_Usage and OE.Process-Sec-IC for the
development and operation environment apply only at TOE products coming with activated Flash Loader
enabled for user data download. In other cases the Flash Loader is not available anymore and the user data
download is completed. Depending on the capabilities of the user software this objective may then reoccur as
subject of the composite TOE.
End of note.


5.3            Security Objectives for the Environment
Since the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL requires the presence of a common secret on both communication entities an additional
objective for the environment is generated:
Following objectives are defined here.

 OE.Resp-Appl                  Treatment of User data of the Composite TOE
                               Please refer to chapter 5.3.1 for clarification

Note 9:
The CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL is a delivery option. In case the user has ordered the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL, the user is responsible to
implement the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL into his user software. In addition, the user has to generate and treat the common
secret in an appropriate way. The objective common secret is therefore similar to the OE.Resp-Appl. Anyhow,
processes and treatment is exclusively subject of the user and his logistic processes.
End of note.

Note 10:
If the user decides to use the integrity protection mode of the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL then the confidentiality of the user
data to be transferred is solely subject of the user.
End of note.

Note 11:
The CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL as cryptographic functionality establishes a cryptographic secured communication channel
between two identified entities. Depending on the implementation and usage, the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL can act either
in the PICC or in the PCD role. In any case the secrets applied for establishing and usage of the secured channel
must be treated in an appropriate way by both entities PICC and PCD.
This means that it is essential on user side that the critical data for establishing this cryptographic secured
communication channel is generated and stored in an appropriate way and that integrity and confidentiality is
maintained.
These preconditions are treated in the PP [9] section 3.1 claims 67 and 68, and are the reason for not placing an
objective for the environment here.
End of note.

(1) These objectives are only valid if the TOE is delivered with active Flash Loader.


5.3.1          Clarification of ‚ÄúTreatment of User Data (OE.Resp-Appl)‚Äù
Regarding the cryptographic services this objective of the environment has to be clarified.
By definition cipher or plain text data and cryptographic keys are user data of the Composite TOE. The
Smartcard Embedded Software shall treat these data appropriately, use only proper secret keys (chosen from a
large key space) as input for the cryptographic function of the TOE and use keys and functions appropriately in
order to ensure the strength of cryptographic operation.
This means that keys are treated as confidential as soon as they are generated. The keys must be unique with a
very high probability, as well as cryptographically strong. For example, it must be ensured that it is beyond
practicality to derive the private key from a public key if asymmetric algorithms are used. If keys are imported
into the TOE and/or derived from other keys, quality and confidentiality must be maintained. This implies that
appropriate key management has to be realized in the environment.
Regarding the memory, software and firmware protection and the SFR and peripheral access rights handling
these objectives of the environment has to be clarified. The treatment of user data of the Composite TOE is also
required when a multi-application operating system is implemented as part of the Smartcard Embedded
Software on the TOE. In this case the multi-application operating system should not disclose security relevant
user data of one application to another application when it is processed or stored on the TOE.


5.3.2     Clarification of ‚ÄúProtection during Composite product Manufacturing
(OE.Process-Sec-IC)‚Äù
The protection during packaging, finishing and personalization includes also the personalization process (Flash
Loader) and the personalization data (TOE software components) during Phase 4, Phase 5 and Phase 6.

Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


 5.5           P.Add-Functions
The justification related to the security objective ‚ÄúAdditional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions)‚Äù
is as follows: Since O.Add-Functions requires the TOE to implement exactly the same specific security
functionality as required by P.Add-Functions; the organizational security policy is covered by the objective.

Nevertheless the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing, O.Malfunction, O.Phys-Manipulation and
O.Leak-Forced define how to implement the specific security functionality required by P.Add-Functions. (Note
that these objectives support that the specific security functionality is provided in a secure way as expected from
P.Add-Functions.) Especially O.Leak-Inherent and O.Leak-Forced refer to the protection of confidential data
(User data of the Composite TOE or TSF data) in general. User data of the Composite TOE are also processed by
the specific security functionality required by P.Add-Functions.

The policy P.Add functions includes the function CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ Cryptographic Library (CCL). This functionality
implements the objectives O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL, O.Prot_Integrity and O.Prot_Confidentiality. The CIPURSE‚Ñ¢
Cryptographic Library (CCL) first prepares and establishes a secure communication channel between two
authenticated entities. The mutual authentication means covers the objective O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL. The
implemented means of session key generation and integrity protection prepares for the confidential and
integrity protected exchange of user data between the two authenticated entities. Thus the objectives
O.Prot_Integrity and O.Prot_Confidentiality are covered too.

The policy P.Add functions includes the function Cipher base Message authentication code (CMAC). This
functionality is implemented by the optional software SCL and implements the option to protect the integrity of
a user data block with a message authentication code. The computing of the CMAC requires the use of either
AES or TDES, as outlined in the chapter P.Crypto-Service 5.9 and also implemented by the optional software
SCL.


 5.6           A.Key-Function
Compared to the PP [9] a further clarification has been made for the security objective ‚ÄúTreatment of user data
of the Composite TOE (OE.Resp-Appl)‚Äù: By definition cipher or plain text data and cryptographic keys are user
data of the Composite TOE. So, the Smartcard Embedded Software will protect such data if required and use
keys and functions appropriately in order to ensure the strength of cryptographic operation. Quality and
confidentiality must be maintained for keys that are imported and/or derived from other keys. This implies that
appropriate key management has to be realized in the environment. That is expressed by the assumption
A.Key‚ÄîFunction which is covered from OE.Resp‚ÄìAppl. These measures make sure that the assumption
A.Resp-Appl is still covered by the security objective OE.Resp-Appl although additional functions are being

 5.7           T.Mem-Access
Compared to the PP [9] an enhancement regarding memory area protection has been established. The clear
definition of privilege levels for operated software establishes the clear separation of different restricted memory
areas for running the firmware ‚Äì regardless of the version in use -, downloading and/or running the operating
system and to establish a clear separation between different applications. Nevertheless, it is also possible to
define a shared memory section where separated applications may exchange defined data. The privilege levels
clearly define by using a hierarchical model the access right from one level to the other. These measures ensure
that the threat T.Mem-Access is clearly covered by the security objective O.Mem-Access.


 5.8           P.Ctrl_Loader, P.Lim_Block_Loader, T.Masquerade_TOE and
               T.Open_Samples_Diffusion
The PP [9] section 7.3 considers the life cycle phases of the TOE also with the organizational policy
P.Lim_Block_Loader and P.Ctlr_Loader as the TOE must be protected against unauthorized usage and control
and against download of malicious software before, during and after the user downloads his software. This is
formalized with the objectives O.Cap_Avail_Loader, O.Authentication and O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader requiring
authentication of the TOE to external entities and a trusted communication channel. The O.Authentication
implements a mutual authentication and involves the environment therefore.
And the policies cover also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must be
regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.
The implemented mutual authentication requires first to authenticate the TOE to the external user. This requires
also knowledge by the user about the sequence of the protocol, interpretation of the transferred data and how to
start the authentication of the TOE. This authentication mean counters the threat T.Masquerade_TOE as only
the genuine TOE is able to identify itself correctly to the enabled user, which covers O.Authentication.
The second step of the mutual authentications mean implements the authentication of the user to the TOE. Only
the user enabled to present the correct authentication data and knowing about the sequence, data
interpretation and signaling of the authentication to the TOE is able to proceed further on.
This enforces OE.TOE_Auth, requiring the support of the verification mechanism and known authentication
reference data by the operational environment.

It is normal business that products enabled for software download by the user are either on their way to the user
or are already stored at user premises. At both situations it cannot be excluded that an attacker could manage to
steal such products enabled for software downloads. The ability to download software on a chip without
operating system and/or application is defined as open sample.
This situation generates the threat T.Open_Samples_Diffusion which is defined as follows:
The download of analysis software could enable an attacker to characterize the product and to construct an
attack path out of the gained information.
This threat is countered by the Flash Loader by following rational:
As long as the Flash Loader is active, controlled usage to the Flash Loader functionality (P.Ctrl_Loader) is
enforced which protects the TOE from achieving the status of being an open sample. And more, even the
attacker could observe, meaning in the sense of measurements during, or induce faults during an authorized
download, the Flash Loader protects the user data of the download by confidentiality and integrity protection
means. The Flash Loader functionalities of mutual authentication, establishing a dedicated trusted
communication channel, the encryption and integrity protection means cover the objectives
O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality, O.Leak-Inherent and O.Leak-Forced.
The policy P.Ctrl_Loader covers also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must
be regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.

Note regarding the Flash Loader:

Public Security Target
Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


The algorithm strength of the Flash Loader has not been cryptographic-analytically evaluated by the BSI, as
Infineon has implemented a proprietary extension.
End of note.

The objective O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader Access control and authenticity for the Loader is covered by following
rational:
The identification of the communication entities of the Flash Loader requires the presence of dedicated
identification data for passing successfully the mutual authentication. This enforces the policy P.Ctrl_Loader
comprising the aspect of the mutual authentication. After successful authentication the user is enabled to
change the keys used for authentication and downloading the user data. This first user is defined as the
administrator. The TOE can then further be operated for example by a service partner who is defined as being
the Download Operator. The equal protecting means as for the Administrator apply here again but due to the
key change different roles are established. The Download Operator downloads then the encrypted user data
with the Flash Loader into the defined and accessible SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM area. This area is access protected by
the MMU.
The policy O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader covers also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it
must be regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.

This objective O.Leak-Inherent is covered with following rational:
This false download threat is countered with the mutual authentication mean as only the correct identified user
is able to download the user intended software and data. Since it is not practical for an attacker to authenticate
correctly a threatening download of attack software is countered. By that possible confidential user data already
stored on the TOE remain protected from disclosure by this method.
If the user is the attacker, or does not follow the user guidance, or bad designed user software implements
weaknesses, the user data remain protected anyway, since even after passing the mutual authentication of the
loader the download is conducted encrypted only. And even more, a different encryption is applied to store the
data in the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM. Since also the number of Flash Loader trials is limited even comprehensive
side channel analysis would not leave sufficient information to conduct a successful attack.
The implemented authentication means cover also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user
premises, as it must be regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.

This objective O.Leak-Forced is covered with following rational:
Another method to gain information is to force information leakage of confidential data processed in the TOE.
Such forcing requires malfunction or physical manipulation. Inducing errors of any kind during data processing
will be discovered by the Integrity Guard with high probability which leads to a security reset. Failures induced
during the mutual authentication or encrypted download process of the Flash Loader will also be discovered as
the perturbation of the sequences leads to fail of the process with trial counter decrement or a fail of the integrity
check of the downloaded data will occur. It would anyway not be practical to induce targeted errors as any
process managing data is protected due to the permanent and differently data encryption and integrity
protection on the TOE.
Physical static manipulation requires the presence of a worthwhile target. This is on one hand hard to identify
and would require intensive reverse engineering due to the topological means such as synthesis of the TOE and
other means. But, on the other hand, if we assume than an attacker could identify such spot, and the physical
preparation was successful too and thus it was possible to probe the targeted signal, then, even assumed the
attacker could analyze the traffic on the signal, the results would be worthless, since the signal data is encrypted
or masked. Thus, the data remains confidentiality protected even outside the TOE, since the analyst neither has
neither the encryption algorithm nor the key.
The Integrity Guard concept and encryption of memory contents are always present and cover also the
environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must be regardless in which environment the
Flash Loader is operated.

Public Security Target
Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


All requirements are fulfilled by the Flash Loader due the strong mutual authentication means enabling only the
authorized user for the download, due to the download of encrypted data only and due to the final locking
command to be applied by the user before delivery. As a consequence the operational environment objectives
OE.Lim_Block_Loader, OE.TOE_Auth and OE.Loader_Usage obligate the composite manufacturer to protect
the authentication data (e.g. keys) against misuse and limit the capability of the Loader.
In addition, the user guidance implements the obligation to permanent disable the Flash Loader prior delivery to
the end-user.

The package 1 defines the final locking of the Flash Loader prior delivery to the end-user and the usage in secure
environment. The package 2 defines that the Flash Loader can be used also in insecure environment. By claiming
both packages the user has the choice to apply the active Flash Loader either in insecure or in secure
environment and achieves by that a maximum of flexibility. Anyhow, the user is obligated to lock the Flash
Loader prior delivery to the end-user in both cases. This is an obligation implemented by the user guidance.
The Flash Loader provides the required functionality to be applied by the composite manufacturer for covering
these objectives.

The objectives O.Cap_Avail_Loader, O.Authentication, O.Loader_Usage and O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality and
the organizational policies P.Lim_Block_Loader and P.Ctlr_Loader as discussed in the PP [9] section 7.2 and 7.3
apply only at TOE products at the life cycle phase delivery, if these products come with activated Flash Loader
enabled for software or data download by the user. In other cases the Flash Loader is not available anymore and
the user software or data download is completed. Depending on the capabilities of the user software these
objectives may then reoccur as subject of the composite TOE.

 5.9          P.Crypto-Service
The PP [9] includes the organizational security policy P.Crypto-Service Cryptographic services of the TOE in a
different extend as it formalizes the objectives O.TDES and O.AES.
For the objective O.TDES a concrete standard reference (NIST) with operational modes is given the
implementation must follow and also the cryptographic key destruction is regulated. The implementation
complies to the given security functional requirements and the objective O.TDES is met.
For the objective O.AES a concrete standard reference (NIST) with a selection of key lengths is given the
implementation must follow and also the cryptographic key destruction is regulated. The implementation
complies to the given security functional requirements and the objective O.AES is met.
For the objective O.AES a concrete standard reference with an algorithm selection is given the implementation
must follow. The implementation complies to the given security functional requirements and the objective
O.AES is met.
The justification of the additional policy and the additional assumption show that they do not contradict to the
rationale already given in the Protection Profile for the assumptions, policy and threats defined there.

There are following extended components defined and described for the TOE:
    ÔÇ∑ the family FCS_RNG at the class FCS Cryptographic Support
    ÔÇ∑ the family FMT_LIM at the class FMT Security Management
    ÔÇ∑ the family FAU_SAS at the class FAU Security Audit

    ÔÇ∑ the component FIA_API.1 at the class FIA Identification and Authentication
The extended components FCS_RNG, FMT_LIM, FAU_SAS, FDP_SDC and FIA_API are defined and described in
PP [9] section 5 and the extended component FIA_API is defined and described in PP [9] section 7.2.
The component FPT_TST.2 is defined in the following.


6.1           Component Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)
The security is strongly dependent on the correct operation of the security functions. Therefore, the TOE shall
support that particular security functions or mechanisms are tested in the operational phase (Phase 7). The tests
can be initiated by the Smartcard Embedded Software and/or by the TOE or is done automatically and
continuously.
Part 2 of the Common Criteria provides the security functional component ‚ÄúTSF testing (FPT_TST.1)‚Äù. The
component FPT_TST.1 provides the ability to test the TSF‚Äôs correct operation.
For the user it is important to know which security functions or mechanisms can be tested. The functional
component FPT_TST.1 does not mandate to explicitly specify the security functions being tested. In addition,
FPT_TST.1 requires verification of the integrity of TSF data and of the stored TSF executable code which might
violate the security policy. Therefore, the functional component ‚ÄùSubset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)‚Äù of
the family TSF self-test has been newly created. This component allows that particular parts of the security
mechanisms and functions provided by the TOE are tested.

 6.1.1        Definition of FPT_TST.2
The functional component ‚ÄúSubset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)‚Äù has been newly created (Common Criteria
Part 2 extended). This component allows that particular parts of the security mechanisms and functions provided
by the TOE can be tested after TOE Delivery or are tested automatically and continuously during normal
operation transparent for the user.
This security functional component is used instead of the functional component FPT_TST.1 from Common
Criteria Part 2. For the user it is important to know which security functions or mechanisms can be tested. The
functional component FPT_TST.1 does not mandate to explicitly specify the security functions being tested. In
addition, FPT_TST.1 requires verifying the integrity of TSF data and stored TSF executable code which might
violate the security policy.
The functional component ‚ÄúSubset TOE testing (FPT_TST.2)‚Äù is specified as follows (Common Criteria Part 2
extended).

   (1) Applies in two alternative operation modes: one mode preserves integrity protected communication and
       the second preserves integrity and confidential communication. Choosing the mode is up to the user and
       his responsibility. For example, the integrity protected mode can be used at secure premises, i.e. where
       eavesdropping is no issue, and the second mode can be applied where the environment is out of control

7.1.1          Extended Components FCS_RNG.1 and FAU_SAS.1

7.1.1.1        FCS_RNG
To define the IT security functional requirements of the TOE an additional family (FCS_RNG) of the Class FCS
(cryptographic support) is defined in the PP [9]. This family describes the functional requirements for random
number generation used for cryptographic purposes.

Please note that the national regulation are outlined in PP [9] chapter 7.5.1 and in AIS31 [13]. These regulations
apply for this TOE.

Note 12:
The functional requirements FCS_RNG.1/TRNG, FCS_RNG.1/HPRG, FCS_RNG.1/DRNG, FCS_RNG.1/KSG, are
iterations of the FCS_RNG.1 defined in the PP [9] according to ‚ÄúAnwendungshinweise und Interpretationen zum
Schema (AIS)‚Äù respectively ‚ÄúA proposal for: Functionality classes for random number generators‚Äù [13].
End of note.

Note 13:
The Physical True Random Number Generator PTRNG implements total failure test of the random source and a
continuous RNG test according to:
National Institute of Standards and Technology, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, Federal
Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS) 140-2, 2002-03-12, chapter 4.9.2.
End of note.

Together with the guidelines in [6] the hybrid PTRNG of this TOE provides random numbers conformant to
several quality metrics as defined in [13]. Depending on the user configuration the TOE provide the according
random number quality. For each addressed quality metric of [13] the definitions are made in the following
chapters.

  FCS_RNG.1.1/KSG       The TSF shall provide a deterministic random number generator that implements:
            DRG.2.1     If initialized with a random seed using a PTRNG of class PTG.2 as random source, the
                        applied seed shall have at least 100 bits of entropy, the internal state of the RNG shall
                        have at least the size of 200 bit ‚Äì in this case the size of the internal state amounts to
                        351 bit, has the work factor for breaking the algorithm of 2127 due to the restriction on

                        amounts to 2127 as well.
          DRG.2.2       The RNG provides forward secrecy.
          DRG.2.3       The RNG provides backward secrecy.
  FCS_RNG.1.2/KSG       The TSF shall provide numbers in the format 8- or 16-bit that meet

                        PTRNG of the class PTG.2, generates output for which any consecutive 234 strings of the
                        length 128 bits are mutually different with probability greater than 1-2(-16).
              DRG.2.5   Statistical test suites cannot practically distinguish the random numbers from the
                        output sequences of an ideal RNG. The random numbers must pass test procedure A.
                        Note:
                        The random numbers have been shown to fulfill all statistical tests of the AIS 20/31
                        statistical tests of procedure A. The random numbers are in the format 8- or 16 Bit.

         ‚Ä¢   Functional Module verification: For the functional verification, black-box testing
             and white-box testing is performed to ensure the correct functionality as
             specified in the functional specification and customer specifications (ordering
             options).
         ‚Ä¢   Security Verification: This test category addresses the security mechanisms
             described in the Security Architecture description. Two main categories of
             security module verification are defined, i.e., integrity protection module




                                                                                           16 / 32

           verification (fault injection) and DPA module verification (side-channel analysis).
           This also includes black-box and white-box testing.
       ‚Ä¢   Characterization: This mostly addresses production tests to measure varying
           parameters in post-silicon verification while all parameters are within the
           specified limits. The developer performs a Matrix Characterization Run to
           measure parameters using varying processes (corner material) and different
           temperatures.
       ‚Ä¢   Qualification: This test category ensures that a developed IC is production ready
           and has the expected quality. This addresses
           ‚Ä¢   electrostatic discharge due to electrostatic stress in the field (contactless
               communication),
           ‚Ä¢   fast aging of the device due to high temperatures to guarantee the life time of
               the product
           ‚Ä¢   Flash qualification to ensure that features like anti-tearing and wear levelling
               work as specified,
           ‚Ä¢   Package qualification to ensure that the IC can be placed in the final delivery
               form (package) under industrial environments and the final product quality is
               achieved, and
           ‚Ä¢   PUF qualification to ensure that the promised PUF properties hold in field
               conditions.
       ‚Ä¢   Validation: Execution of all customer-visible use cases to ensure that the entire
           system works as defined for customer-visible operation. This includes
           ‚Ä¢   on-chip test framework developed to use each officially released product
               variant and execute each public available API,
           ‚Ä¢   a Java Card OS is used to execute reference transactions for banking and
               egov.
Independent Testing according to ATE_IND
Testing approach:
   ‚Ä¢   The evaluator's objective regarding this aspect was to test the functionality of the
       TOE as described in the ST and to verify the developer's test results by repeating
       developer's tests and additionally add independent tests.
   ‚Ä¢   In the course of the evaluation of the TOE the following classes of tests were
       carried out:
       ‚Ä¢   Module tests,
       ‚Ä¢   Simulation tests,
       ‚Ä¢   Tests in User Mode of logical card A and B,
       ‚Ä¢   Tests in System Mode of card A and B,
       ‚Ä¢   Tests in test mode
       ‚Ä¢   Hardware tests and
       ‚Ä¢   Cryptographic library tests.

     ‚Ä¢   With this kind of tests the entire security functionality of the TOE was tested.
Penetration Testing according to AVA_VAN
Overview:
     ‚Ä¢   The penetration testing was partially performed using the developer‚Äôs testing
         environment, partially using the test environment of the evaluation body.
     ‚Ä¢   All configurations of the TOE being intended to be covered by the current evaluation
         were tested.
     ‚Ä¢   The overall test result is that no deviations were found between the expected and
         the actual test results; moreover, no attack scenario with the attack potential high
         was actually successful.
Penetration testing approach:
     ‚Ä¢   Systematic search for potential vulnerabilities and known attacks in public domain
         sources, use of a list of vulnerabilities, and from a methodical analysis of the
         evaluation documents.
     ‚Ä¢   Analysis why these vulnerabilities are unexploitable in the intended environment of
         the TOE.
     ‚Ä¢   If the rationale is suspect in the opinion of the evaluator penetration tests are
         devised.
     ‚Ä¢   Even if the rational is convincing in the opinion of the evaluator penetration tests are
         devised for some vulnerabilities, especially to support the argument of non-
         practicability of exploiting time in case of SPA, DPA and FI attacks.

8.       Evaluated Configuration
The N7021 VA can be delivered with various configuration options as described in chapter
1.4.2 of [6] and [9]. The configuration options are divided into two groups: major
configuration options and minor configuration options.
Three major configurations can be chosen by the customer during the ordering process:
     ‚Ä¢   Configuration based on 320 kBytes of Flash memory as code space,
     ‚Ä¢   Configuration based on 240 kBytes of Flash memory as code space,
     ‚Ä¢   Configuration based on 144 kBytes of ROM memory as code space.
Each major configuration is provided with several minor configuration options. These minor
configuration options (and all others) for NXP Secure Smart Card Controller N7021 VA can
be selected by the customer via Order Entry Form (see [28]). The Order Entry Form
identifies all the minor configuration options, which are supported by the major
configuration.
The N7021 VA hardware platform was tested including all minor configuration options that
can be selected based on Table 1.2 in chapter 1.4.2.2 of [6] and [9]. All minor
configurations were available to the evaluator. The major configuration does not have
dependencies to security features. All minor configuration options that are part of the
evaluation were tested. The minor configuration options behave as specified and
described in [11] and [20]. Therefore the results described in this document are applicable
for all minor configurations described in [6] and [9].

A.      Certification

1.      Preliminary Remarks
Under the BSIG1 Act, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) has the task of
issuing certificates for information technology products.
Certification of a product is carried out on the instigation of the vendor or a distributor,
hereinafter called the sponsor.
A part of the procedure is the technical examination (evaluation) of the product according
to the security criteria published by the BSI or generally recognised security criteria.
The evaluation is normally carried out by an evaluation facility recognised by the BSI or by
BSI itself.
The result of the certification procedure is the present Certification Report. This report
contains among others the certificate (summarised assessment) and the detailed
Certification Results.
The Certification Results contain the technical description of the security functionality of
the certified product, the details of the evaluation (strength and weaknesses) and
instructions for the user.

2.      Specifications of the Certification Procedure
The certification body conducts the procedure according to the criteria laid down in the
following:
‚óè   Act on the Federal Office for Information Security1
‚óè   BSI Certification and Approval Ordinance2

3.      Recognition Agreements
In order to avoid multiple certification of the same product in different countries a mutual
recognition of IT security certificates - as far as such certificates are based on ITSEC or
CC - under certain conditions was agreed.

3.1.    European Recognition of CC ‚Äì Certificates (SOGIS-MRA)
The SOGIS-Mutual Recognition Agreement (SOGIS-MRA) Version 3 became effective in
April 2010. It defines the recognition of certificates for IT-Products at a basic recognition
level and, in addition, at higher recognition levels for IT-Products related to certain SOGIS
Technical Domains only.
The basic recognition level includes Common Criteria (CC) Evaluation Assurance Levels
EAL 1 to EAL 4. For "Smartcards and similar devices" a SOGIS Technical Domain is in
place. For "HW Devices with Security Boxes" a SOGIS Technical Domains is in place, too.
In addition, certificates issued for Protection Profiles based on Common Criteria are part of
the recognition agreement.
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes, details on
recognition, and the history of the agreement can be seen on the website at
https://www.sogisportal.eu.
The SOGIS-MRA logo printed on the certificate indicates that it is recognised under the
terms of this agreement by the related bodies of the signatory nations. A disclaimer
beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of recognition.
This certificate is recognized under SOGIS-MRA for all assurance components selected.

3.2.    International Recognition of CC ‚Äì Certificates (CCRA)
The international arrangement on the mutual recognition of certificates based on the CC
(Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement, CCRA-2014) has been ratified on 08
September 2014. It covers CC certificates based on collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP)
(exact use), CC certificates based on assurance components up to and including EAL 2 or
the assurance family Flaw Remediation (ALC_FLR) and CC certificates for Protection
Profiles and for collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP).
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes can be seen on
the website: https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org.
The Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement logo printed on the certificate indicates
that this certification is recognised under the terms of this agreement by the related bodies
of the signatory nations. A disclaimer beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of
recognition.
This certificate is recognized according to the rules of CCRA-2014, i. e. up to and including
CC part 3 EAL 2+ ALC_FLR components.

  (DS) and DSs must sign exclusively correct Document Security Objects to be
  stored on travel document.

OE.Personalisation
  Personalisation of travel document
  The travel document Issuer must ensure that the Personalisation Agents
  acting on his behalf
      (i) establish the correct identity of the travel document holder and create
          the biographical data for the travel document,
      (ii) enroll the biometric reference data of the travel document holder,
      (iii) write a subset of these data on the physical Passport (optical
          personalisation) and store them in the travel document (electronic
          personalisation) for the travel document holder as defined in [ICAO-
          9303],
      (iv) write the document details data,
      (v) write the initial TSF data,
      (vi) sign the Document Security Object defined in [ICAO-9303] (in the role
          of a DS).

4.2.3 Terminal operator: Terminal receiving branch

OE.Terminal
  Terminal operating
  The terminal operators must operate their terminals as follows:
     1.) The related terminals (basic inspection systems, cf. above) are used by
        terminal operators and by travel document holders as defined in [ICAO-
        9303].
     2.) The related terminals implement the terminal parts of the PACE
        protocol [ICAO-9303] part 11, of the Passive Authentication [ICAO-
        9303] part 11 (by verification of the signature of the Document Security

         and (almost) uniformly selected nonces, if required by the protocols (for
         generating ephemeral keys for Diffie-Hellmann).
      3.) The related terminals need not to use any own credentials.
      4.) The related terminals securely store the Country Signing Public Key
         and the Document Signer Public Key (in form of CCSCA and CDS) in
         order to enable and to perform Passive Authentication of the travel
         document (determination of the authenticity of data groups stored in
         the travel document, [ICAO-9303] part 12).
      5.) The related terminals and their environment must ensure
         confidentiality and integrity of respective data handled by them (e.g.
         confidentiality of the PACE passwords, integrity of PKI certificates, etc.),
         where it is necessary for a secure operation of the TOE according to the
         current PP.

4.2.4 Travel document holder Obligations

OE.Travel_Document_Holder
  Travel document holder Obligations
  The travel document holder may reveal, if necessary, his or her verification
  values of the PACE password to an authorized person or device who definitely
  act according to respective regulations and are trustworthy.

4.2.5 Receiving State or Organisation

OE.Exam_Travel_Document
  Examination of the physical part of the travel document
  The inspection system of the receiving State or Organisation must examine
  the travel document presented by the traveler to verify its authenticity by
  means of the physical security measures and to detect any manipulation of the
  physical part of the travel document. The Basic Inspection System for global
  interoperability (i) includes the Country Signing CA Public Key and the
  Document Signer Public Key of each issuing State or Organisation, and (ii)
  implements the terminal part of PACE [ICAO-9303] part 11 and/or the Basic
  Access Control [ICAO-9303]. Extended Inspection Systems perform
  additionally to these points the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1 to verify
  the Authenticity of the presented travel document‚Äôs chip.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Counterfeit and the Assumption A.Insp_Sys by demanding the Inspection
  System       to     perform     the     Chip     Authentication     protocolv.1.
  OE.Exam_Travel_Document also repeats partly the requirements from
  OE.Terminal in [PACE-PP] and therefore also counters T.Forgery and A.
  Passive_Auth from [PACE-PP]. This is done because a new type of Inspection
  System is introduced in this PP as the Extended Inspection System is needed

OE.AA_MRTD
      Active Authentication - Inspection Systems5
      An Active Authentication (Basic, General or Extended) Inspection system
      performs all the functions of the Basic, General and Extended Inspection
      System, and verifies the IC authenticity with an RSA or ECDSA signature
      generated by the MRTD (if available).



OE.Prot_Logical_Travel_Document
  Protection of data from the logical travel document
  The inspection system of the receiving State or Organisation ensures the
  confidentiality and integrity of the data read from the logical travel document.
  The inspection system will prevent eavesdropping to their communication with
  the TOE before secure messaging is successfully established based on the Chip
  Authentication Protocol Version 1.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP]in order to handle the Assumption
  A.Insp_Sys by requiring the Inspection System to perform secure messaging
  based on the Chip Authentication Protocol v.1.

OE.Ext_Insp_Systems
  Authorization of Extended Inspection Systems
  The Document Verifier of receiving States or Organisations authorizes
  Extended Inspection Systems by creation of Inspection System Certificates for
  access to sensitive biometric reference data of the logical travel document.
  The Extended Inspection System authenticates themselves to the travel
  document‚Äôs chip for access to the sensitive biometric reference data with its
  private Terminal Authentication Key and its Inspection System Certificate.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Read_Sensitive_Data, the Organisational Security Policy P.Sensitive_Data
  and the Assumption A. Auth_PKI as it specifies the pre-requisite for the
  Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 as it concerns the responsibilities of the
  Document Verifier and the Inspection Systems.

4.3 Security Objectives Rationale

4.3.1 Threats

4.3.1.1 Threats listed in PP PACE

T.Skimming addresses accessing the User Data (stored on the TOE or
  transferred between the TOE and the terminal) using the TOE's
  contactless/contact interface. This threat is countered by the security
  objectives        OT.Data_Integrity,        OT.Data_Authenticity        and
  OT.Data_Confidentiality through the PACE authentication. The objective
  OE.Travel_Document_Holder ensures that a PACE session can only be
  established either by the travel document holder itself or by an authorised
  person or device, and, hence, cannot be captured by an attacker.

T.Eavesdropping addresses listening to the communication between the TOE
  and a rightful terminal in order to gain the User Data transferred there. This
  threat is countered by the security objective OT.Data_Confidentiality through a
  trusted channel based on the PACE authentication.

T.Tracing addresses gathering TOE tracing data identifying it remotely by
  establishing or listening to a communication via the contactless/contact
  interface of the TOE, whereby the attacker does not a priori know the correct
  values of the PACE password. This threat is directly countered by security
  objectives    OT.Tracing   (no    gathering   TOE     tracing    data)   and
  OE.Travel_Document_Holder (the attacker does not a priori know the correct
  values of the shared passwords).

T.Forgery 'Forgery of data' addresses the fraudulent, complete or partial
  alteration of the User Data or/and TSF-data stored on the TOE or/and
  exchanged between the TOE and the terminal. Additionally to the security
  objectives from PACE PP [PACE-PP] which counter this threat, the examination
  of     the     presented   MRTD       passport    book       according    to
  OE.Exam_Travel_Document 'Examination of the physical part of the travel
  document' shall ensure its authenticity by means of the physical security
  measures and detect any manipulation of the physical part of the travel
  document.
  The threat T.Forgery also addresses the fraudulent, complete or partial
  alteration of the User Data or/and TSF-data stored on the TOE or/and

                       eMRTD Configuration)

  exchanged between the TOE and the terminal. The security objective
  OT.AC_Pers requires the TOE to limit the write access for the travel document
  to the trustworthy Personalisation Agent (cf. OE.Personalisation). The TOE will
  protect the integrity and authenticity of the stored and exchanged User Data
  or/and TSF-data as aimed by the security objectives OT.Data_Integrity and
  OT.Data_Authenticity, respectively. The objectives OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper and
  OT.Prot_Abuse-Func contribute to protecting integrity of the User Data or/and
  TSF-data stored on the TOE. A terminal operator operating his terminals
  according to OE.Terminal and performing the Passive Authentication using the
  Document Security Object as aimed by OE.Passive_Auth_Sign will be able to
  effectively verify integrity and authenticity of the data received from the TOE.

T.Abuse-Func addresses attacks of misusing TOE's functionality to manipulate
  or to disclosure the stored User- or TSF-data as well as to disable or to bypass
  the soft-coded security functionality. The security objective OT.Prot_Abuse-
  Func ensures that the usage of functions having not to be used in the
  operational phase is effectively prevented.

T.Information_Leakage is typical for integrated circuits like smart cards under
  direct attack with high attack potential. The protection of the TOE against this
  threat is obviously addressed by the directly related security objective
  OT.Prot_Inf_Leak.

T.Phys-Tamper is typical for integrated circuits like smart cards under direct
  attack with high attack potential. The protection of the TOE against this threat
  is obviously addressed by the directly related security objective OT.Prot_Phys-

  OE.Ext_Insp_Systems 'Authorization of Extended Inspection Systems'.

T.Counterfeit 'Counterfeit of travel document chip data' addresses the attack of
  unauthorized copy or reproduction of the genuine travel document's chip. This
  attack is thwarted by chip an identification and authenticity proof required by
  OT.Chip_Auth_Proof 'Proof of travel document's chip authentication' using an
  authentication key pair to be generated by the issuing State or Organisation.
  The Public Chip Authentication Key has to be written into EF.DG14 and signed
  by    means     of  Documents       Security    Objects    as   demanded     by
  OE.Auth_Key_Travel_Document 'Travel document Authentication Key'.
  According to OE.Exam_Travel_Document 'Examination of the physical part of
  the travel document' the General Inspection system has to perform the Chip
  Authentication Protocol Version 1 to verify the authenticity of the travel
  document's chip. Moreover, the Active Authentication Public Key has to be
  written into EF.DG15 as demanded by OE.Auth_Key_MRTD 'MRTD

Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


 5.5           P.Add-Functions
The justification related to the security objective ‚ÄúAdditional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions)‚Äù
is as follows: Since O.Add-Functions requires the TOE to implement exactly the same specific security
functionality as required by P.Add-Functions; the organizational security policy is covered by the objective.

Nevertheless the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing, O.Malfunction, O.Phys-Manipulation and
O.Leak-Forced define how to implement the specific security functionality required by P.Add-Functions. (Note
that these objectives support that the specific security functionality is provided in a secure way as expected from
P.Add-Functions.) Especially O.Leak-Inherent and O.Leak-Forced refer to the protection of confidential data
(User data of the Composite TOE or TSF data) in general. User data of the Composite TOE are also processed by
the specific security functionality required by P.Add-Functions.

The policy P.Add functions includes the function CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ Cryptographic Library (CCL). This functionality
implements the objectives O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL, O.Prot_Integrity and O.Prot_Confidentiality. The CIPURSE‚Ñ¢
Cryptographic Library (CCL) first prepares and establishes a secure communication channel between two
authenticated entities. The mutual authentication means covers the objective O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL. The
implemented means of session key generation and integrity protection prepares for the confidential and
integrity protected exchange of user data between the two authenticated entities. Thus the objectives
O.Prot_Integrity and O.Prot_Confidentiality are covered too.

The policy P.Add functions includes the function Cipher base Message authentication code (CMAC). This
functionality is implemented by the optional software SCL and implements the option to protect the integrity of
a user data block with a message authentication code. The computing of the CMAC requires the use of either
AES or TDES, as outlined in the chapter P.Crypto-Service 5.9 and also implemented by the optional software
SCL.


 5.6           A.Key-Function
Compared to the PP [9] a further clarification has been made for the security objective ‚ÄúTreatment of user data
of the Composite TOE (OE.Resp-Appl)‚Äù: By definition cipher or plain text data and cryptographic keys are user
data of the Composite TOE. So, the Smartcard Embedded Software will protect such data if required and use
keys and functions appropriately in order to ensure the strength of cryptographic operation. Quality and
confidentiality must be maintained for keys that are imported and/or derived from other keys. This implies that
appropriate key management has to be realized in the environment. That is expressed by the assumption
A.Key‚ÄîFunction which is covered from OE.Resp‚ÄìAppl. These measures make sure that the assumption
A.Resp-Appl is still covered by the security objective OE.Resp-Appl although additional functions are being
supported according to P.Add-Functions.

Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


 5.7           T.Mem-Access
Compared to the PP [9] an enhancement regarding memory area protection has been established. The clear
definition of privilege levels for operated software establishes the clear separation of different restricted memory
areas for running the firmware ‚Äì regardless of the version in use -, downloading and/or running the operating
system and to establish a clear separation between different applications. Nevertheless, it is also possible to
define a shared memory section where separated applications may exchange defined data. The privilege levels
clearly define by using a hierarchical model the access right from one level to the other. These measures ensure
that the threat T.Mem-Access is clearly covered by the security objective O.Mem-Access.


 5.8           P.Ctrl_Loader, P.Lim_Block_Loader, T.Masquerade_TOE and
               T.Open_Samples_Diffusion
The PP [9] section 7.3 considers the life cycle phases of the TOE also with the organizational policy
P.Lim_Block_Loader and P.Ctlr_Loader as the TOE must be protected against unauthorized usage and control
and against download of malicious software before, during and after the user downloads his software. This is
formalized with the objectives O.Cap_Avail_Loader, O.Authentication and O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader requiring
authentication of the TOE to external entities and a trusted communication channel. The O.Authentication
implements a mutual authentication and involves the environment therefore.
And the policies cover also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must be
regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.
The implemented mutual authentication requires first to authenticate the TOE to the external user. This requires
also knowledge by the user about the sequence of the protocol, interpretation of the transferred data and how to
start the authentication of the TOE. This authentication mean counters the threat T.Masquerade_TOE as only
the genuine TOE is able to identify itself correctly to the enabled user, which covers O.Authentication.
The second step of the mutual authentications mean implements the authentication of the user to the TOE. Only
the user enabled to present the correct authentication data and knowing about the sequence, data
interpretation and signaling of the authentication to the TOE is able to proceed further on.
This enforces OE.TOE_Auth, requiring the support of the verification mechanism and known authentication
reference data by the operational environment.

It is normal business that products enabled for software download by the user are either on their way to the user
or are already stored at user premises. At both situations it cannot be excluded that an attacker could manage to
steal such products enabled for software downloads. The ability to download software on a chip without
operating system and/or application is defined as open sample.
This situation generates the threat T.Open_Samples_Diffusion which is defined as follows:
The download of analysis software could enable an attacker to characterize the product and to construct an
attack path out of the gained information.
This threat is countered by the Flash Loader by following rational:
As long as the Flash Loader is active, controlled usage to the Flash Loader functionality (P.Ctrl_Loader) is
enforced which protects the TOE from achieving the status of being an open sample. And more, even the
attacker could observe, meaning in the sense of measurements during, or induce faults during an authorized
download, the Flash Loader protects the user data of the download by confidentiality and integrity protection
means. The Flash Loader functionalities of mutual authentication, establishing a dedicated trusted
communication channel, the encryption and integrity protection means cover the objectives
O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality, O.Leak-Inherent and O.Leak-Forced.
The policy P.Ctrl_Loader covers also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must
be regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.

Note regarding the Flash Loader:

Public Security Target
Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


The algorithm strength of the Flash Loader has not been cryptographic-analytically evaluated by the BSI, as
Infineon has implemented a proprietary extension.
End of note.

The objective O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader Access control and authenticity for the Loader is covered by following
rational:
The identification of the communication entities of the Flash Loader requires the presence of dedicated
identification data for passing successfully the mutual authentication. This enforces the policy P.Ctrl_Loader
comprising the aspect of the mutual authentication. After successful authentication the user is enabled to
change the keys used for authentication and downloading the user data. This first user is defined as the
administrator. The TOE can then further be operated for example by a service partner who is defined as being
the Download Operator. The equal protecting means as for the Administrator apply here again but due to the
key change different roles are established. The Download Operator downloads then the encrypted user data
with the Flash Loader into the defined and accessible SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM area. This area is access protected by
the MMU.
The policy O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader covers also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it
must be regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.

This objective O.Leak-Inherent is covered with following rational:
This false download threat is countered with the mutual authentication mean as only the correct identified user
is able to download the user intended software and data. Since it is not practical for an attacker to authenticate
correctly a threatening download of attack software is countered. By that possible confidential user data already
stored on the TOE remain protected from disclosure by this method.
If the user is the attacker, or does not follow the user guidance, or bad designed user software implements
weaknesses, the user data remain protected anyway, since even after passing the mutual authentication of the
loader the download is conducted encrypted only. And even more, a different encryption is applied to store the
data in the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM. Since also the number of Flash Loader trials is limited even comprehensive
side channel analysis would not leave sufficient information to conduct a successful attack.
The implemented authentication means cover also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user
premises, as it must be regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.

This objective O.Leak-Forced is covered with following rational:
Another method to gain information is to force information leakage of confidential data processed in the TOE.
Such forcing requires malfunction or physical manipulation. Inducing errors of any kind during data processing
will be discovered by the Integrity Guard with high probability which leads to a security reset. Failures induced
during the mutual authentication or encrypted download process of the Flash Loader will also be discovered as
the perturbation of the sequences leads to fail of the process with trial counter decrement or a fail of the integrity
check of the downloaded data will occur. It would anyway not be practical to induce targeted errors as any
process managing data is protected due to the permanent and differently data encryption and integrity
protection on the TOE.
Physical static manipulation requires the presence of a worthwhile target. This is on one hand hard to identify
and would require intensive reverse engineering due to the topological means such as synthesis of the TOE and
other means. But, on the other hand, if we assume than an attacker could identify such spot, and the physical
preparation was successful too and thus it was possible to probe the targeted signal, then, even assumed the
attacker could analyze the traffic on the signal, the results would be worthless, since the signal data is encrypted
or masked. Thus, the data remains confidentiality protected even outside the TOE, since the analyst neither has
neither the encryption algorithm nor the key.
The Integrity Guard concept and encryption of memory contents are always present and cover also the
environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must be regardless in which environment the
Flash Loader is operated.

Public Security Target
Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


All requirements are fulfilled by the Flash Loader due the strong mutual authentication means enabling only the
authorized user for the download, due to the download of encrypted data only and due to the final locking
command to be applied by the user before delivery. As a consequence the operational environment objectives
OE.Lim_Block_Loader, OE.TOE_Auth and OE.Loader_Usage obligate the composite manufacturer to protect
the authentication data (e.g. keys) against misuse and limit the capability of the Loader.
In addition, the user guidance implements the obligation to permanent disable the Flash Loader prior delivery to
the end-user.

The package 1 defines the final locking of the Flash Loader prior delivery to the end-user and the usage in secure
environment. The package 2 defines that the Flash Loader can be used also in insecure environment. By claiming
both packages the user has the choice to apply the active Flash Loader either in insecure or in secure
environment and achieves by that a maximum of flexibility. Anyhow, the user is obligated to lock the Flash
Loader prior delivery to the end-user in both cases. This is an obligation implemented by the user guidance.
The Flash Loader provides the required functionality to be applied by the composite manufacturer for covering
these objectives.

The objectives O.Cap_Avail_Loader, O.Authentication, O.Loader_Usage and O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality and
the organizational policies P.Lim_Block_Loader and P.Ctlr_Loader as discussed in the PP [9] section 7.2 and 7.3
apply only at TOE products at the life cycle phase delivery, if these products come with activated Flash Loader
enabled for software or data download by the user. In other cases the Flash Loader is not available anymore and
the user software or data download is completed. Depending on the capabilities of the user software these
objectives may then reoccur as subject of the composite TOE.

 5.9          P.Crypto-Service
The PP [9] includes the organizational security policy P.Crypto-Service Cryptographic services of the TOE in a
different extend as it formalizes the objectives O.TDES and O.AES.
For the objective O.TDES a concrete standard reference (NIST) with operational modes is given the
implementation must follow and also the cryptographic key destruction is regulated. The implementation
complies to the given security functional requirements and the objective O.TDES is met.
For the objective O.AES a concrete standard reference (NIST) with a selection of key lengths is given the
implementation must follow and also the cryptographic key destruction is regulated. The implementation
complies to the given security functional requirements and the objective O.AES is met.
For the objective O.AES a concrete standard reference with an algorithm selection is given the implementation
must follow. The implementation complies to the given security functional requirements and the objective
O.AES is met.
The justification of the additional policy and the additional assumption show that they do not contradict to the
rationale already given in the Protection Profile for the assumptions, policy and threats defined there.

Extended Component Definition (ASE_ECD)




6             Extended Component Definition (ASE_ECD)
There are following extended components defined and described for the TOE:
    ÔÇ∑ the family FCS_RNG at the class FCS Cryptographic Support
    ÔÇ∑ the family FMT_LIM at the class FMT Security Management
    ÔÇ∑ the family FAU_SAS at the class FAU Security Audit
    ÔÇ∑ the component FDP_SDC.1 at the class FDP User Data Protection
    ÔÇ∑ the component FPT_TST.2 at the class FPT Protection of the TSF
    ÔÇ∑ the component FIA_API.1 at the class FIA Identification and Authentication
The extended components FCS_RNG, FMT_LIM, FAU_SAS, FDP_SDC and FIA_API are defined and described in
PP [9] section 5 and the extended component FIA_API is defined and described in PP [9] section 7.2.
The component FPT_TST.2 is defined in the following.


6.1           Component Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)
The security is strongly dependent on the correct operation of the security functions. Therefore, the TOE shall
support that particular security functions or mechanisms are tested in the operational phase (Phase 7). The tests
can be initiated by the Smartcard Embedded Software and/or by the TOE or is done automatically and
continuously.
Part 2 of the Common Criteria provides the security functional component ‚ÄúTSF testing (FPT_TST.1)‚Äù. The
component FPT_TST.1 provides the ability to test the TSF‚Äôs correct operation.
For the user it is important to know which security functions or mechanisms can be tested. The functional
component FPT_TST.1 does not mandate to explicitly specify the security functions being tested. In addition,
FPT_TST.1 requires verification of the integrity of TSF data and of the stored TSF executable code which might
violate the security policy. Therefore, the functional component ‚ÄùSubset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)‚Äù of
the family TSF self-test has been newly created. This component allows that particular parts of the security
mechanisms and functions provided by the TOE are tested.

 6.1.1        Definition of FPT_TST.2
The functional component ‚ÄúSubset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)‚Äù has been newly created (Common Criteria
Part 2 extended). This component allows that particular parts of the security mechanisms and functions provided
by the TOE can be tested after TOE Delivery or are tested automatically and continuously during normal
operation transparent for the user.
This security functional component is used instead of the functional component FPT_TST.1 from Common
Criteria Part 2. For the user it is important to know which security functions or mechanisms can be tested. The
functional component FPT_TST.1 does not mandate to explicitly specify the security functions being tested. In
addition, FPT_TST.1 requires verifying the integrity of TSF data and stored TSF executable code which might
violate the security policy.

   (1) Applies in two alternative operation modes: one mode preserves integrity protected communication and
       the second preserves integrity and confidential communication. Choosing the mode is up to the user and
       his responsibility. For example, the integrity protected mode can be used at secure premises, i.e. where
       eavesdropping is no issue, and the second mode can be applied where the environment is out of control
       of the user.
   (2) These security functional requirements SFR apply only if the SCL- meaning one of the two alternatives -
       is on board of the delivered TOE products.
   (3) Note that the assignment of the in the table above selected SFRs to Flash Loader or CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL do
       not implement an augmentation as the extension it is just to clarify the part of the TOE claiming the

         coming with activated Flash Loader enabled for user data download. In other cases the Flash Loader is
         not available anymore and the user data download is completed. Depending on the capabilities of the
         user software these security functional requirements may then reoccur as subject of the composite TOE.
     ÔÇ∑ The security functional requirements FCS_COP.1/CCL, FCS_CKM.1/CCL, FCS_CKM.4/CCL apply only if
         the CCL is on board and if the operation mode confidential communication is chosen.


7.1.1          Extended Components FCS_RNG.1 and FAU_SAS.1

7.1.1.1        FCS_RNG
To define the IT security functional requirements of the TOE an additional family (FCS_RNG) of the Class FCS
(cryptographic support) is defined in the PP [9]. This family describes the functional requirements for random
number generation used for cryptographic purposes.

Please note that the national regulation are outlined in PP [9] chapter 7.5.1 and in AIS31 [13]. These regulations
apply for this TOE.

Note 12:
The functional requirements FCS_RNG.1/TRNG, FCS_RNG.1/HPRG, FCS_RNG.1/DRNG, FCS_RNG.1/KSG, are
iterations of the FCS_RNG.1 defined in the PP [9] according to ‚ÄúAnwendungshinweise und Interpretationen zum
Schema (AIS)‚Äù respectively ‚ÄúA proposal for: Functionality classes for random number generators‚Äù [13].
End of note.

Note 13:
The Physical True Random Number Generator PTRNG implements total failure test of the random source and a
continuous RNG test according to:
National Institute of Standards and Technology, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, Federal
Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS) 140-2, 2002-03-12, chapter 4.9.2.
End of note.

Together with the guidelines in [6] the hybrid PTRNG of this TOE provides random numbers conformant to
several quality metrics as defined in [13]. Depending on the user configuration the TOE provide the according

                                   Unlike section 7.2.1 our implementation not only returns the x-coordinate of the shared
                                   secret, but rather the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate.
Note:
This SFR is not applicable if the TOE is delivered with a blocked Crypto@2304T or without EC library.
Note:
The certification covers the standard NIST [17] and Brainpool [18] Elliptic Curves with key lengths as defined in the SFRs.
Note that there are further uncounted side-channel secure curve types, which the user can optionally add in the
composition certification process.
Note:
For easy integration of EC functions into the user‚Äôs operating system and/or application, the library contains single
cryptographic functions respectively primitives which are compliant to the standard. The primitives are referenced above.
Therefore, the library supports the user to develop an application representing the standard if required.
Note:
The EC primitives allow the selection of various curves. The selection of the curves depends to the user.

7.1.4.9 SHA-2 Operation
The SHA-2 Operation of the TOE shall meet the requirement ‚ÄúCryptographic operation (FCS_COP.1)‚Äù as specified below.

                              meet the following standards:

                              FIPS 180-4 as of 2015-08 [19]
Note:
This SFR is not applicable if the TOE is delivered without the SHA-2 library.
Note:
The SHA-2 cryptographic operation is a keyless operation.
Note:    The SHA-2 implementation is not intended to be used on confidential input data. For such use cases specific
security improvements and side channel analysis are recommended.

7.2.1         Refinements
Some refinements are taken unchanged from the PP [1]. In some cases a clarification is necessary. In the table above an
overview is given where the refinement is done.
The refinements from the PP [1] have to be discussed here in the Security Target, as the assurance level is increased. The
refinements from the PP [1] are included in the chosen assurance level EAL 6 augmented with  unauthorized copy or reproduction of the genuine travel document's chip. This
  attack is thwarted by chip an identification and authenticity proof required by
  OT.Chip_Auth_Proof 'Proof of travel document's chip authentication' using an
  authentication key pair to be generated by the issuing State or Organisation.
  The Public Chip Authentication Key has to be written into EF.DG14 and signed
  by    means     of  Documents       Security    Objects    as   demanded     by
  OE.Auth_Key_Travel_Document 'Travel document Authentication Key'.
  According to OE.Exam_Travel_Document 'Examination of the physical part of
  the travel document' the General Inspection system has to perform the Chip
  Authentication Protocol Version 1 to verify the authenticity of the travel
  document's chip. Moreover, the Active Authentication Public Key has to be
  written into EF.DG15 as demanded by OE.Auth_Key_MRTD 'MRTD
  Authentication Key'. According to OE.AA_MRTD 'Active Authentication -
  Inspection Systems' the Inspection system has to perform the Active
  Authentication Protocol to verify the authenticity of the MRTD‚Äôs chip.

4.3.2 Organisational Security Policies

4.3.2.1 OSP listed in PP PACE

P.Manufact requires a unique identification of the IC by means of the
  Initialization Data and the writing of the Pre-personalisation Data as being
  fulfilled by OT.Identification.

P.Pre-Operational is enforced by the following security objectives:
  OT.Identification is affine to the OSP's property 'traceability before the
  operational phase; OT.AC_Pers and OE.Personalisation together enforce the
  OSP's properties 'correctness of the User and the TSF-data stored' and
  'authorisation of Personalisation Agents'; OE.Legislative_Compliance is affine
  to the OSP's property 'compliance with laws and regulations'.

P.Card_PKI is enforced by establishing the issuing PKI branch as aimed by the
  objectives OE.Passive_Auth_Sign (for the Document Security Object).

P.Trustworthy_PKI is enforced by OE.Passive_Auth_Sign (for CSCA, issuing
  PKI branch).

P.Terminal 'Abilities and trustworthiness of terminals' is countered by the
  security objective OE.Exam_Travel_Document additionally to the security
  objectives from PACE PP [PACE-PP]. OE.Exam_Travel_Document enforces the
  terminals to perform the terminal part of the PACE protocol.
  The OSP P.Terminal is obviously enforced by the objective OE.Terminal,
  whereby the one-to-one mapping between the related properties is applicable.



4.3.2.2 Additional OSPs from PP EAC

P.Sensitive_Data 'Privacy of sensitive biometric reference data' is fulfilled and
  the threat T.Read_Sensitive_Data 'Read the sensitive biometric reference data'
  is countered by the TOE-objective OT.Sens_Data_Conf 'Confidentiality of
  sensitive biometric reference data' requiring that read access to EF.DG3 and
  EF.DG4 (containing the sensitive biometric reference data) is only granted to
  authorized inspection systems. Furthermore it is required that the
  transmission of these data ensures the data's confidentiality. The authorization
  bases on Document Verifier certificates issued by the issuing State or
  Organisation as required by OE.Authoriz_Sens_Data 'Authorization for use of
  sensitive biometric reference data'. The Document Verifier of the receiving
  State has to authorize Extended Inspection Systems by creating appropriate
  Inspection System certificates for access to the sensitive biometric reference
  data as demanded by OE.Ext_Insp_Systems 'Authorization of Extended
  Inspection Systems'.

                       eMRTD Configuration)

P.Personalisation 'Personalisation of the travel document by issuing State or
  Organisation only' addresses the (i) the enrolment of the logical travel
  document by the Personalisation Agent as described in the security objective
  for the TOE environment OE.Personalisation 'Personalisation of logical travel
  document', and (ii) the access control for the user data and TSF data as
  described by the security objective OT.AC_Pers 'Access Control for
  Personalisation of logical travel document'. Note the manufacturer equips the
  TOE with the Personalisation Agent Key(s) according to OT.Identification
  'Identification and Authentication of the TOE'. The security objective
  OT.AC_Pers limits the management of TSF data and the management of TSF
  to the Personalisation Agent.

5 Extended Requirements


5.1 Definition of the Family FAU_SAS
To describe the security functional requirements of the TOE, the family FAU_SAS
of the class FAU (Security Audit) is defined here. This family describes the
functional requirements for the storage of audit data. It has a more general
approach than FAU_GEN, because it does not necessarily require the data to be
generated by the TOE itself and because it does not give specific details of the
content of the audit records.

The family ‚ÄúAudit data storage (FAU_SAS)‚Äù is specified as follows:

Family behavior:

This family defines functional requirements for the storage of audit data.

Component leveling:




FAU_SAS.1          Requires the TOE to provide the possibility to store audit data.

Management:        FAU_SAS.1
                   There are no management activities foreseen.

Audit:             FAU_SAS.1
                   There are no actions defined to be auditable.
