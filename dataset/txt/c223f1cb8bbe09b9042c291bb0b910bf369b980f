The package type does not influence the security functionality of the TOE. For all package types listed above the
security during development and production is ensured (refer to Section 1.4.3).
All commercial types listed above are subject of this evaluation. Unless described explicitly all information given
in the remainder of the ST applies to all commercial types.

1.4.2     Logical Scope of TOE
1.4.2.1   Hardware Description
The TOE contains a general-purpose low-power CPU that supports a 32-/16-bit instruction set optimized for
smartcard applications. The on-chip hardware components are controlled by the TO FW Software via Special
Function Registers. These registers are correlated to the activities of the CPU, the memory management
unit, interrupt control, communication, EEPROM, timers, the AES co-processor and other HW blocks. The
communication with the TOE is performed through the contactless interface.


The device includes ROM (64 kByte), RAM (1.25 kByte) and EEPROM (2 kByte) memory. The ROM is split in
ROM constants, Test code and User code. The AES co-processor supports AES and LRP operations with a key
length of 128 bits. The random number generator provides true random numbers, which are used, beside other
purposes, to seed pseudo random number generator used for less or non-security critical operations.

1.4.2.2   Software Description
The IC Dedicated Test software in the Test code of the TOE is used by the TOE Manufacturer to test the
functionality of the chip and to guarantee high production fault coverage. The test functionality is disabled before
the operational use of the TOE. The IC Dedicated Test Software includes test routine for all HW blocks including
memories, support of the RAM code execution during the test, test commands and access control to ensure that

security relevant test operations cannot be executed illegally once the TOE is configured in the user operating
mode.


The TOE also contains IC Dedicated Support Software. The Boot ROM software is part of the IC Dedicated
Support Software. The Boot SW is executed after each reset of the TOE, i.e. every time when the TOE starts. It
sets up the TOE and does initial configuration. IC Dedicated Support Software further contains code for anti-tear
protection, HAL library, CRC, memory management unit as well as control of crypto co-processor and RNG.


The Operating System (OS) Software is also part of the TOE. It includes a generic application OS and four different
applications. Only one of the applications is available during usage. OS Software provides the main functionality
of the TOE in the usage phase. The TOE is primarily designed for secure contactless transport applications and
related loyalty programs as well as access control systems. It fully complies with the requirements for fast and
secure data transmission and interoperability with existing infrastructure. Its functionality consists of:

     ‚Ä¢ Static file system with one active application.
     ‚Ä¢ Support for different file types like value files, data record files and Transaction MAC file (for MIFARE DESFire
         Light and MIFARE IDentity variants of the TOE).
     ‚Ä¢ Mutual three pass authentication
     ‚Ä¢ Authentication on application level with fine-grained access conditions for files.
     ‚Ä¢ Data encryption on the communication path.
     ‚Ä¢ Message Authentication Codes (MAC) for replay attack protection.
     ‚Ä¢ Transaction system with rollback that ensures consistency for complex transactions.
     ‚Ä¢ Unique serial number for each device (UID) with optional random UID.
     ‚Ä¢ Transaction MAC feature to prevent fraudulent merchant attacks.
     ‚Ä¢ Originality functionality that allows verifying the authenticity of the TOE.
     ‚Ä¢ AES based Leakage Resilient Primitive (LRP) crypto functionality with higher SCA resistance.
     ‚Ä¢ Secure Dynamic Messaging functionality, resulting in a Secure Unique NFC Message (SUN) for
         NTAG42x(Tf) variants of the TOE, that allows confidential and integrity protected data exchange, without
         requiring a preceding authentication
     ‚Ä¢ Tag-tamper detection,
     ‚Ä¢ The TOE supports a MIFARE DESFire EV2 backward compatible authentication with 128 bit AES.

The TOE features enable it to be used for a variety of applications:

     ‚Ä¢ Electronic fare collection
     ‚Ä¢ Stored value card systems

If privacy is an issue, the TOE can be configured not to disclose any information to unauthorized users by
randomizing the UID used for communication establishment and protecting the device specific internal UID.
However, the privacy protection needs to be supported by proper application settings. In particular, this requires
avoiding the exposure of other card specific pieces of information that allows for tracing the card. In case that a
specific customer use-case requires the free exposure of such information the TOE still guarantees the protection
of the internal UID but the user needs to be aware that the non-traceability objective is then no longer achieved.
For further details on this aspect, refer to the guidance documentation.


1.4.2.3   Documentation
Refer to Section 1.4.1 for the documentation, which forms part of the TOE delivery.

1.4.3     Security during Development and Production
During the design, the layout process of the IC and the development of the software only people involved in the
specific development project have access to sensitive data. The security measures installed within NXP ensure a
secure computer system and provide appropriate equipment for the different development tasks.
The developers of NXP Semiconductors, Business Unit Security & Connectivity provide the verified layout data
directly to the wafer fab. The wafer fab generates and forwards the layout data related to the different photo masks
to the manufacturer of the photo masks. The photo masks are generated off-site and verified against the design
data of the development before the usage. The accountability and the traceability is ensured among the wafer fab
and the photo mask provider.
The test process of every die is performed by a test centre of NXP. Delivery processes between the involved
sites provide accountability and traceability of the produced wafers. NXP embeds the die into specific modules
(as stated in section 1.4.1.1), based on customer demand. Information about non-functional items is stored
on magnetic/optical media enclosed with the delivery, available for download or the non-functional items are
physically marked.
In summary, the TOE can be delivered in two different forms:

     ‚Ä¢ Diced dies on wafers
     ‚Ä¢ Modules on a module reel

The different (package) types are described in detail in section 1.4.1.1

1.4.4     Life Cycle and Delivery of the TOE
The life-cycle phases are according to the standard life-cycle for Security IC products as detailed in the Protection
Profile (see section 2.4 for details), Section 1.2.4:

     ‚Ä¢ Phase 1: IC Embedded Software Development

     ‚Ä¢ Phase 2: IC Development

     ‚Ä¢ Phase 3: IC Manufacturing

     ‚Ä¢ Phase 4: IC Packaging

     ‚Ä¢ Phase 5: Composite Product Integration

     ‚Ä¢ Phase 6: Personalisation

     ‚Ä¢ Phase 6a (Optional): Finalization of the personalization

     ‚Ä¢ Phase 7: Operational Usage

During TOE packaging TOE will be embedded either in a plastic inlay (plastic layer containing printed or wired
antenna) for direct antenna connection or in one of the supported package types (MOA4 or MOA8). The module
and card embedding of the TOE provide external security mechanisms because they make it harder for an
attacker to access parts of the TOE for physical manipulation.

1.3        TOE Overview
1.3.1       Introduction
NXP has developed the TOE to be used with Proximity Coupling Devices (PCDs, also called "terminals")
according to ISO14443 Type A [10][12][13][11]. The communication protocol complies to ISO 14443 part 3 [13]
and 4 [11]. The TOE is primarily designed for secure contactless transport applications, loyalty programs, access
management, closed loop payment, account based services and secure NFC applications. It fully complies with
the requirements for fast and highly secure data transmission and interoperability with existing infrastructure.


The TOE provides resistance against attack of an attacker with an enhanced-basic attack potential. This is
achieved by a combination of different security features that provide a base-line protection against information
leakage via side-channels, fault injections and physical attacks. Furthermore, the TOE protects the different
operating modes of the Security IC to avoid ab-use by an attacker. Protected by these security features the TOE
implements the following main security services:

     ‚Ä¢ secure mutual authentication to support authentication of authorized users and the TOE
     ‚Ä¢ secure channel establishment and secure messaging to support confidential and integrity protected data
         transfer
     ‚Ä¢ secure dynamic messaging to allow secure export of user data in unauthenticated state on MIFARE IDentity
         and NTAG42x DNA (Tf) variants of the TOE
     ‚Ä¢ supporting non-traceability of the TOE by providing the option to use random IDs during contactless protocol
         establishment
     ‚Ä¢ enhanced secure transaction management provided by the MIFARE DESFire Light and MIFARE IDentity
         variants of the TOE
     ‚Ä¢ additional functionality to check the status of a tamper evident tag provided by the NTAG42x DNA Tf variant
         of the TOE




 Final                                                                                          ¬©NXP B.V. 2018. All rights reserved.

These security functionalities aim at enabling card issuers to use the product for various use-cases as outlined in
the following.


The TOE is a Security IC comprising a hardware platform and a fixed software package. The software is stored in
ROM and provides an operating system which implements a set of functions used to manage various kinds of data
files stored in the non-volatile EEPROM memory. The operating system provides access control if required by
the configuration. The operating system is designed as platform, which supports command sets for four different
applications forming four different product variants, in detail:

     ‚Ä¢ MIFARE DESFire Light: the MF2DL(H)x0 variant of the TOE (short: MF2DL) is intended for limited-use
         transport tickets (value and account based), event ticketing (e.g. cinema, game or concert) or access
         control badges and also loyalty cards. The card reader command set is to be compatible with (a subset of)
         the MIFARE DESFire EV2 command set.

     ‚Ä¢ MIFARE IDentity: the MF2ID(H)10 variant of the TOE (short: MF2ID) is intended for account-based services
         e.g. account based ticketing in transport application or event management. The card reader command set
         is to be compatible with (a subset of) the MIFARE DESFire EV2 command set

     ‚Ä¢ NTAG42x DNA: the NT4H2x21Gf variant of the TOE (short: NTAG42x) is intended as NFC Forum Type 4
         Tag. It might generate Secure Unique NFC Message in each tap for direct access to web services. A subset
         of the supported card reader command set is to be compatible with the NFC Forum Type 4 Tag standard.

     ‚Ä¢ NTAG42x DNA Tf: the NT4H2x21Tf variant of the TOE (short: NTAG42xTf) is identical to NTAG42x DNA,
         but supports additionally the "tag tamper feature", which allows the user to control when a tamper evidence
         mechanism has been triggered. This feature supports use cases, where product integrity needs to be
         verified e.g. seals for high-value liquids.

Remark 1. The reader of this Security Target must be aware, that the references to the different variants of the
TOE might vary throughout the document. Depending on the context, one of the available names (as introduced
above) might be used. For example, the MIFARE DESFire Light variant of the TOE might be referenced either
by the full name (MIFARE DESFire Light), the short name (MF2DL) or the technical name (MF2DL(H)x0). Same
holds for other variants of the TOE, where in particular NTAG42x DNA and NTAG42x DNA Tf might be referred to
as NTAG42x DNA (Tf) respectively NTAG42x(Tf) when addressing both variants with one identifier.


The concrete product variant is instantiated by NXP during production by properly configuring the operating
system platform and the provisioning of a dedicated file system layout. The security features of the platform
enforce that once configured to one of above listed products the product variant cannot be further changed.


The customer can optionally provide pre-defined content for the file system via Order Entry Form (OEF) to support
customer specific use cases, which is integrated into the TOE by NXP during controlled production process.

The file system is under full control of the access rule management provided by the operating system, which
enforces the isolation of the NXP proprietary configuration data, files and keys. In addition, the operating system
platform allows for enabling and disabling various configuration options using dedicated command during normal
operation. The default settings for these configuration options can also be chosen by the customer for proper
setting during production by NXP. In case sufficient security anchors (i.e. customer specific keys) are properly set
during production by NXP the customer can safely finalize the pre-personalization and personalization relying on
the protection features of the TOE already. In any case the customer must adhere to the guidance requirements
for finishing the personalization process.

As a consequence, each variant of the TOE is identified precisely by the version of the underlying hardware
and software operating system augmented with the identification of the one of the four main application variants
(MIFARE DESFire Light, MIFARE IDentity, NTAG42x DNA and NTAG42x DNA Tf) used for production. The TOE
does not provide any code loading or application management functionality after production. The only exception
is a feature of the MIFARE DESFire Light variant, which allows renaming the DF in the file system. However, this
management feature does not impact the security and in particular the access protection of the file system.


The TOE includes also IC Dedicated Software for test purposes during production. This functionality is perma-
nently blocked once the TOE is configured in user operating mode. The micro-controller comprises a 16-bit
processing unit, volatile and non-volatile memories, cryptographic co-processor, security components and one
communication interface.


The TOE includes a guidance document and a datasheet for each of the four TOE variants. The different (package)
types are described in detail in Section 1.4.1.1.

1.3.2       TOE Type
The TOE is a Security IC comprising a hardware platform, a fixed software package implemented in ROM and a
set of data files stored in EEPROM. The TOE is delivered in different formats as described in section 1.4.1.1. For
each variant of the product, the documentation consists of:
     ‚Ä¢ The Product Data Sheet providing the functional specification as well as the available interfaces of the variant
         of the TOE, and
     ‚Ä¢ The Guidance and Operational Manual providing guidelines for secure usage and operation of the security
         functionality of the variant of the TOE.
All relevant documents are listed in table 1.1, thus being components of the TOE.

1.3.3       Required non-TOE Hardware/Software/Firmware
The TOE requires an ISO 14443 [10, 12, 13, 11] compliant card terminal to be provided with power and to receive
adequate commands.

The package type does not influence the security functionality of the TOE. For all package types listed above the
security during development and production is ensured (refer to Section 1.4.3).
All commercial types listed above are subject of this evaluation. Unless described explicitly all information given
in the remainder of the ST applies to all commercial types.

1.4.2     Logical Scope of TOE
1.4.2.1   Hardware Description
The TOE contains a general-purpose low-power CPU that supports a 32-/16-bit instruction set optimized for
smartcard applications. The on-chip hardware components are controlled by the TO FW Software via Special
Function Registers. These registers are correlated to the activities of the CPU, the memory management
unit, interrupt control, communication, EEPROM, timers, the AES co-processor and other HW blocks. The
communication with the TOE is performed through the contactless interface.


The device includes ROM (64 kByte), RAM (1.25 kByte) and EEPROM (2 kByte) memory. The ROM is split in
ROM constants, Test code and User code. The AES co-processor supports AES and LRP operations with a key
length of 128 bits. The random number generator provides true random numbers, which are used, beside other
purposes, to seed pseudo random number generator used for less or non-security critical operations.

1.4.2.2   Software Description
The IC Dedicated Test software in the Test code of the TOE is used by the TOE Manufacturer to test the
functionality of the chip and to guarantee high production fault coverage. The test functionality is disabled before
the operational use of the TOE. The IC Dedicated Test Software includes test routine for all HW blocks including
memories, support of the RAM code execution during the test, test commands and access control to ensure that

security relevant test operations cannot be executed illegally once the TOE is configured in the user operating
mode.


The TOE also contains IC Dedicated Support Software. The Boot ROM software is part of the IC Dedicated
Support Software. The Boot SW is executed after each reset of the TOE, i.e. every time when the TOE starts. It
sets up the TOE and does initial configuration. IC Dedicated Support Software further contains code for anti-tear
protection, HAL library, CRC, memory management unit as well as control of crypto co-processor and RNG.


The Operating System (OS) Software is also part of the TOE. It includes a generic application OS and four different
applications. Only one of the applications is available during usage. OS Software provides the main functionality
of the TOE in the usage phase. The TOE is primarily designed for secure contactless transport applications and
related loyalty programs as well as access control systems. It fully complies with the requirements for fast and
secure data transmission and interoperability with existing infrastructure. Its functionality consists of:

     ‚Ä¢ Static file system with one active application.
     ‚Ä¢ Support for different file types like value files, data record files and Transaction MAC file (for MIFARE DESFire
         Light and MIFARE IDentity variants of the TOE).
     ‚Ä¢ Mutual three pass authentication
     ‚Ä¢ Authentication on application level with fine-grained access conditions for files.
     ‚Ä¢ Data encryption on the communication path.
     ‚Ä¢ Message Authentication Codes (MAC) for replay attack protection.
     ‚Ä¢ Transaction system with rollback that ensures consistency for complex transactions.
     ‚Ä¢ Unique serial number for each device (UID) with optional random UID.
     ‚Ä¢ Transaction MAC feature to prevent fraudulent merchant attacks.
     ‚Ä¢ Originality functionality that allows verifying the authenticity of the TOE.
     ‚Ä¢ AES based Leakage Resilient Primitive (LRP) crypto functionality with higher SCA resistance.
     ‚Ä¢ Secure Dynamic Messaging functionality, resulting in a Secure Unique NFC Message (SUN) for
         NTAG42x(Tf) variants of the TOE, that allows confidential and integrity protected data exchange, without
         requiring a preceding authentication
     ‚Ä¢ Tag-tamper detection,
     ‚Ä¢ The TOE supports a MIFARE DESFire EV2 backward compatible authentication with 128 bit AES.

The TOE features enable it to be used for a variety of applications:

     ‚Ä¢ Electronic fare collection
     ‚Ä¢ Stored value card systems

randomizing the UID used for communication establishment and protecting the device specific internal UID.
However, the privacy protection needs to be supported by proper application settings. In particular, this requires
avoiding the exposure of other card specific pieces of information that allows for tracing the card. In case that a
specific customer use-case requires the free exposure of such information the TOE still guarantees the protection
of the internal UID but the user needs to be aware that the non-traceability objective is then no longer achieved.
For further details on this aspect, refer to the guidance documentation.


1.4.2.3   Documentation
Refer to Section 1.4.1 for the documentation, which forms part of the TOE delivery.

1.4.3     Security during Development and Production
During the design, the layout process of the IC and the development of the software only people involved in the
specific development project have access to sensitive data. The security measures installed within NXP ensure a
secure computer system and provide appropriate equipment for the different development tasks.
The developers of NXP Semiconductors, Business Unit Security & Connectivity provide the verified layout data
directly to the wafer fab. The wafer fab generates and forwards the layout data related to the different photo masks
to the manufacturer of the photo masks. The photo masks are generated off-site and verified against the design
data of the development before the usage. The accountability and the traceability is ensured among the wafer fab
and the photo mask provider.
The test process of every die is performed by a test centre of NXP. Delivery processes between the involved
sites provide accountability and traceability of the produced wafers. NXP embeds the die into specific modules
(as stated in section 1.4.1.1), based on customer demand. Information about non-functional items is stored
on magnetic/optical media enclosed with the delivery, available for download or the non-functional items are
physically marked.
In summary, the TOE can be delivered in two different forms:

     ‚Ä¢ Diced dies on wafers
     ‚Ä¢ Modules on a module reel

The different (package) types are described in detail in section 1.4.1.1

1.4.4     Life Cycle and Delivery of the TOE
The life-cycle phases are according to the standard life-cycle for Security IC products as detailed in the Protection
Profile (see section 2.4 for details), Section 1.2.4:

     ‚Ä¢ Phase 1: IC Embedded Software Development

     ‚Ä¢ Phase 2: IC Development

     ‚Ä¢ Phase 3: IC Manufacturing

     ‚Ä¢ Phase 4: IC Packaging

     ‚Ä¢ Phase 5: Composite Product Integration

     ‚Ä¢ Phase 6: Personalisation

     ‚Ä¢ Phase 6a (Optional): Finalization of the personalization

     ‚Ä¢ Phase 7: Operational Usage

During TOE packaging TOE will be embedded either in a plastic inlay (plastic layer containing printed or wired
antenna) for direct antenna connection or in one of the supported package types (MOA4 or MOA8). The module
and card embedding of the TOE provide external security mechanisms because they make it harder for an
attacker to access parts of the TOE for physical manipulation.
