    2.4         TOE Overview

2.4.1               TOE Definition
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) addressed by this ST is an electronic passport representing a smart card
implementing [ICAO_9303_10], [ICAO_9303_11], [TR-03110_1] and [TR-03110_3]. This smart card / passport
provides the following application:
     the travel document containing the related user data as well as data needed for authentication with BAC,
     PACE, EAC or AA protocols (incl. PACE/BAC passwords); this application is intended to be used by
     governmental organisations as a machine readable travel document (MRTD).
For the ePassport application, the travel document holder can control access to his user data by conscious
presenting his travel document to governmental organisations.The travel document’s chip is integrated into a
physical (plastic or paper), optically readable part of the travel document, which – as the final product – shall
eventually supersede still existing, merely optically readable travel documents. The plastic or paper, optically
readable cover of the travel document, where the travel document’s chip is embedded in, is not part of the
TOE. The tying-up of the travel document’s chip to the plastic travel document is achieved by physical and
organizational security measures being out of scope of the TOE.

2.4.2               TOE Operational Usage
A State or Organization issues MRTDs to be used by the holder for international travel. The traveler presents a
MRTD to the inspection system to prove his or her identity. The MRTD in context of this ST contains (i) visual
(eye readable) biographical data and portrait of the holder, (ii) a separate data summary (MRZ data) for visual
and machine reading using OCR methods (see [ICAO_9303_01]) in the Machine readable zone (MRZ) and (iii)
data elements on the MRTD’s chip. The authentication of the traveller is based on (i) the possession of a valid
travel document personalised for a holder with the claimed identity as given on the biographical data page and
(ii) biometrics using the reference data stored in the travel document. The issuing State or Organisation ensures
the authenticity of the data of genuine travel documents. The receiving State trusts a genuine travel document
of an issuing State or Organisation.

2.4.3               TOE Major Security Features
The following TOE security features are the most significant for its operational use:
    Verifying authenticity and integrity as well as securing confidentiality of user data in the communication
     channel between the TOE and the connected terminal supporting the protocols BAC, SAC(PACE) as per
     [ICAO_9303_11] and EAC as per [TR-03110_1]
    Averting of inconspicuous tracing of the travel document as per [TR-03110_1]
    Self-protection of the TOE security functionality and the data stored inside as per [TR-03110_1]
    Means to check authenticity of the terminal, Terminal Authentication as per [TR-03110_1]
    Means to prove authenticity of the chip by means of Active Authentication or Chip Authentication as per [TR-
     03110_1]
    Chip authentication followed by terminal authentication used as a precondition to provide access to
     biometric data known as EAC, as per [TR-03110_1]

 2.6              TOE Description

2.6.1               Component Overview
The TOE is a DI chip with the ePassport configuration of SECORA™ ID S Infineon Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0.
It is based on the requirements from the ICAO for machine readable travel documents, i.e. [ICAO_9303_10],
[ICAO_9303_11], [TR-03110_1] and [TR-03110_3].
Figure 1 shows the TOE in terms of its components.
The grey color indicates what contributes to fulfill the security claims in this ST. The white color indicates
optional components which are not in the scope of the security claims of this ST, in CC terminology these are
non interefering with the TSF of the TOE.
   -    The two lower layers in the picture represent the smart card controller referenced by IFX_CCI_000005
        together with the Firmware, Asymmetric Cryptographic Library (ACL) and a Symmetric Crypto Library
        (SCL). Note that these components are certified by the same CC certificate BSI-DSZ-CC-1110-V2-2019.
        The hardware platform provides effective protection mechanisms against fault attacks. The platform
        contains hardware co-processors, which support cryptographic standards such as TDES, AES, RSA and
        EC. The hardware co-processor SCP has integrated measures against successful SCA.
   -    The OS platform called “Secora ID S” is a Java Card OS and offers services for:
                 The standard Java Card features like API, the Java Card Runtime Environment and the Java
                  Card Virtual Machine
               Proprietary PACE API providing special countermeasures against side channel leakage
               GP for content management
               Crypto operations (hash, EC, RSA, TDES and AES)
               Communication via the contactless interface and contact interface.
        It is certified in Common Criteria under the Certificate NSCIB-CC-175887.
        Secora ID S supports the standard open Java Card mode as well as the proprietary static mode
        (installation of preloaded code is possible) and the proprietary mode native (specially tailored mode for
        eMRTD usecase which enforces non traceablity of the TOE). Open and static modes are the two possible

       modes during personalization of the TOE. The TOE goes into native mode once the personalization is
       terminated. See [ST_JC_ID_S_Platform] for more details on the supported modes in Secora ID S OS.
   -   ISO or EU Electronic Driving License (eDL) or an Electronic ID(eID) are configurations of SECORA™ ID S
       Applet Infineon Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0. For more information on these optional features refer
       to [UserGuideDataBook], [UserGuideAdmin]. As already said these applications are not part of the TOE
       Security Functionalities and are non interfering with the TSFs of the TOE. The installation of eDL and
       eID is done by the customer who uses the cap file of SECORA™ ID S Applet Infineon Applet Collection
       preloaded on the card by Infineon. Again, no claims of the security for the eDL or the eID applications
       are made in this ST.
   -   ePassport configuration of SECORA™ ID S Applet Infineon Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0 is a Java Card
       applet which provides the functions of the electronic Passport as per [ICAO_9303_10], [ICAO_9303_11],
       [TR-03110_1] and [TR-03110_3].
       The installation of ePass is done by the customer who uses for this purpose the cap file of SECORA™ ID
       S Applet Infineon Applet Collection preloaded on the card by Infineon.
       The applet uses the services of the Java Card Secora ID S OS described above. It manages the various
       stages of the product’s lifecycle once the application is onto the hardware up to its end of life. The
       application implements the protocols:
                 BAC
                 PACE
                 EAC
                 AA
       It does not implement any cryptographic primitives, as these are provided by the underlying Java Card
       OS. Further it manages file access control and authentication failure handling. Also the application
       controls the secure messaging including error handling using the Java Card OS Crypto services, which
       subsequently relies on the features of the underlying hardware providing high integrity and side
       channel protection. The claims in terms of SFRs in this ST target the SECORA™ ID S Applet Infineon
       Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0.

   -   Third party applications can be installed by the customer and running on the card. Note that in this
       case the JC Secora ID S is delivered in open mode, see [ST_JC_ID_S_Platform] to the customer which
       will be then able to load and install 3rd party applications.
The TOE user guidance comprises:
   -   [UserGuideDataBook] and [UserGuideAdmin] which provide guidance, how to perform personalization
       and maintain the targeted security level during Personalisation and Operation phase.

Figure 1      TOE components overview




2.6.2              Interfaces of the TOE
   -    The physical interface of the TOE to the external environment is the entire surface of the IC.
   -    The RF interface (radio frequency power and signal interface) enabling contactless communication
        between a PICC (proximity integration chip card, PICC) and a terminal reader/writer (proximity coupling
        device, terminal). The transmission protocol meets [ISO/IEC 14443-3] and [ISO/IEC 14443-4] Type B.
   -    The contact based interface ISO 7816-3 supported for the purposes of eID and eDL.
   -    The command interface to the TOE is provided by the ePassport Application.



2.6.3              Package Types
The TOE package types and formats are exactly the same as for the underlying Java Card OS. The package
types and formats of the Java Card OS Secora ID S are described in [ST_JC_ID_S_Platform], section 1.4.3 and
1.4.6.


2.6.4              Lifecycle and Delivery
The [PP_EAC], [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC] define the lifecycle phases for the TOE as follows:
1. Development
   - Step 1: Development of hardware and IC dedicated software (firmware)
   - Step 2: Development of IC embedded software

2. Manufacturing
   - Step 3: manufacturing of IC and IC dedicated software. As the TOE does not provide any user ROM,
       manufacturing of IC embedded software parts in ROM are not relevant here.
   - Step 4 (optional): Combination of IC with contactless interface of the travel document
   - Step 5 (Prepersonalization): loading on the device of the executable Java Card OS image. Loading of
       the application JC package containing the TOE code, eDL and eID code.
3. Personalisation of Travel Document
   - Step 6: this step is performed by the customer. The customer receives from Infineon the TOE
       composed of the following components:
           o The underlying hardware
           o The underlying Java Card OS can be in two possible modes: either in the standard Java Card
                open mode (loading and installation of applets are possible) or in the proprietary Java Card
                static mode (preloaded by Infineon packages can be installed, applet loading is not possible).
           o The cap file of SECORA™ ID S Applet Infineon Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0 is preloaded by
                Infineon.
           o The customer then proceeds to installing the ePassport configuration of SECORA™ ID S Infineon
                Applet Collection - eMRTD V1.0 and optionally installing the ISO/EU eDL or eID. In case the
                Secora ID S is in open mode the customer can load and install 3rd party applets. During this step
                the customer also performs the personalisation with biometric data and configuration of the
                TSF if necessary.
4. Operational Use
   - Step 7: once the personalization of the product is finished, the Java Card ID S OS is switched to its
       proprietary native mode usage of the TOE by the personalizer. Native mode switches off GP and
       identification commands to disallow tracking of the end user.

  7             Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)

  7.1           TOE Security Functional Requirements
 The security functional requirements (SFR) for this TOE are defined in this chapter.
This ST covers the three PPs [PP_SAC], [PP_EAC] and [PP_BAC] each two of which have a non empty
intersection of SFRs. In the rest of this section we provide a classification of the SFRs of these PPs depending on
where these SFRs are declared and if they need a refinement here in this ST.
 Table 1 lists all SFRs appearing both in [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC].
 Table 2 lists all SFRs declared in [PP_SAC].
Table 3 lists all SFRs specific to [PP_BAC]. Note that some of the SFRs appear in both [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC]
with same name but different content. In such cases the SFR is iterated with either the extension …/BAC or
…/PACE.
Table 4 lists all SFRs specific to [PP_EAC]. Note that [PP_EAC] is an extension of [PP_SAC], therefore all SFRs of
[PP_SAC] are SFRs in [PP_EAC], i.e. the SFRs listed in Table 3 and Table 4 are also SFRs of [PP_EAC].
Table 5 lists the SFRs introduced in this ST which are related to the Active Authentication mechanism
supported by the TOE.

7.1.1                About the Application Notes in this ST
Note that if an SFR has application notes as per the PPs [PP_SAC], [PP_EAC] and [PP_BAC] then these
application notes apply and can be found in the respective PPs.
Some SFRs contain additional application notes to ease the understanding of the specificities of this TOE.
These application notes do not come from the PPs and are prefixed with [IFX specific].

  FCS_CKM.4                Cryptographic key destruction – Session keys

  Hierarchical to:         No other components.

  Dependencies:            [FDP_ITC.1 Import of user data without security attributes, or FDP_ITC.2 Import of
                           user data with security attributes, or FCS_CKM.1 Cryptographic key generation]:

                           fulfilled by FCS_CKM.1/DH_PACE in case of PACE

  FCS_CKM.4.1              The TSF shall destroy cryptographic keys in accordance with a specified

                           Application note 19 of [PP_BAC] and application note 28 of [PP_SAC] are both
 [IFX specific]            applicable for this SFR. There is no contradiction between the two application
 Application Note:         notes. While the application note from [PP_BAC] simply requests the encryption
                           and message authentication keys to be destroyed, the application note from
                           [PP_SAC] provides more detailed requests, when the session keys have to be
                           destroyed. Therefore FCS_CKM.4 from [PP_SAC] and [PP_BAC] can be combined.

                          from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be combined, i.e. the random numbers shall be
                          used for the PACE, BAC and the authentication mechanism based on Triple-DES (as
                          defined in FIA_UAU.4/PACE and FIA_UAU.4).

 FPT_TST.1                TSF testing

 Hierarchical to:         No other components.

 Dependencies:            No dependencies.

 FPT_TST.1.1              The TSF shall run a suite of self tests during initial start-up, to demonstrate the
                          correct operation of the TSF.

 FPT_TST.1.2              The TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to verify the integrity of

                          stored TSF executable code.



 [IFX specific]           There is no contradiction between application note 46 of [PP_BAC] and application
                          note 52 of [PP_SAC]. In fact, although the wording is slightly different, the meaning
 Application Note:
                          of these application notes is identical. Therefore either of these application notes
                          applies and FPT_TST.1 from [PP_BAC] and [PP_SAC] can be combined.




 FPT_PHP.3                Resistance to physical attack

 Hierarchical to:         No other components.

 Dependencies:            No dependencies.

 FPT_PHP.3.1              The TSF shall resist physical manipulation and physical probing to the TSF by
                          responding automatically such that the SFRs are always enforced.

 [IFX specific]           Application note 47 of [PP_BAC] and 53 of [PP_SAC] are equivalent. Application
                          note 48 of [PP_BAC] is only informative to the reader in the sense, that it provides a
 Application Note:
                          context to an older CC standard, but not relevant for the interpretation of

                          Authentication Mechanism v1.
                          4. The TOE accepts the authentication attempt by means of the Terminal
                          Authentication Protocol v.1 only if the terminal uses the public key presented
                          during the Chip Authentication Protocol v.1 and the secure messaging established

 7.2           Security Assurance Requirements
For the BAC feature, the TOE claims EAL 4 augmented with ALC_DVS.2, therefore [PP_BAC] section 6.2 “Security
Assurance Requirements for the TOE” applies.
For PACE and PACE-EAC features, the current document claims EAL5 augmented with ALC_DVS.2 and
AVA_VAN.5 therefore it claims a higher assurance level compared to [PP_SAC] and [PP_EAC], section 6.2
respectively.

 7.3          Security Requirements Rationale

7.3.1             Security Functional Requirements Rationale
Respective sections 6.3.1 “Security Functional Requirements Rationale” of [PP_SAC], [PP_BAC] and [PP_EAC]
are applicable for this chapter.
For the additionally defined SFRs in this ST, FIA_API.1/AA, FMT_MTD.1/AA and FCS_COP.1/SIG_GEN formalizing
the Active Authentication feature they meet the security objective OT.Active_Auth.




7.3.2             Rationale for SFR’s Dependencies
[PP_SAC], [PP_BAC] and [PP_EAC] section 6.3.2 “Rationale for SFR’s Dependencies” are also applicable for this
chapter.


7.3.3             Security Assurance Requirements Rationale
[PP_BAC] section 6.3.3 “Security Assurance Requirements Rationale “ is applicable for this chapter.
[PP_EAC] and [PP_SAC] and their respective sections 6.3.3 “Security Assurance Requirements Rationale“ are
also applicable for this chapter with one additional rationale justifying the security assurance dependencies.
With the exception of ALC_DVS.2 and AVA_VAN.5, all assurance components are part of the EAL5 package,
which by package design does not have any dependency conflicts and is hierarchical to EAL4. The assurance
components ALC_DVS.2 and AVA_VAN.5 are also part of the assurance requirements from [PP_SAC], where
assurance dependencies are met as is shown in section 6.3.3 from [PP_SAC].
EAL5+ augmented with ALC_DVS.2 and AVA_VAN.5 is appropriate for this TOE, because this assurance level is
requested by several states. The assurance expectations for this kind of application are high due to the
sensitivity of data stored by the TOE. Therefore several governmental organizations request for an increased
assurance level.


7.3.4              Security Requirements – Internal Consistency
The rationale for the internal consistency of the SFRs from [PP_SAC], [PP_BAC] and [PP_EAC] section 6.3.4
“Security Requirements – Internal Consistency” are also applicable to this chapter.
The assurance package EAL5 and EAL4 are pre-defined sets of internally consistent assurance requirements.
The dependency analysis for the sensitive assurance components in [PP_SAC], [PP_EAC] and [PP_BAC] section
7.3.3 “Security Assurance Requirements Rationale” together with the additional rational from section 7.3.3
show that the assurance requirements are internally consistent as all (additional) dependencies are satisfied
and no inconsistency appears.
The rationale for internal consistency between functional and assurance requirements from [PP_SAC] ,
[PP_EAC] and and [PP_BAC] section 6.3.4 “Security Requirements – Internal Consistency” are also applicable to
this chapter.

    8             TOE Summary Specification
This TOE summary specification described in this section relies on the security services provided by the
platform product. For a description of these services please refer to [ST_JC_ID_S_Platform].
In the following each SFR is mentioned together with an indication for the PP from which these are originating
        -   (BAC) stands for SFRs originating from [PP_BAC].
        -   (SAC) stands for SFRs originating from [PP_SAC].
        -   (EAC) stands for SFRs originating from [PP_EAC]. Note that we include here also in this group the SFRs
            related to Active Authentication.
The composite TOE provides the security functions as follows:
       SF_EAC_PACE_BAC
The TOE implements the EAC, PACE and BAC protocol (PICC side). It encompasses:
        -   ECDH key generation, FCS_CKM.1/DH_PACE (SAC) and FCS_CKM.1/CA (EAC): The TOE uses the
            platform service “Elliptic Curves EC” for EC key generation. Further for session key generation the
            application uses the hybrid physical random number generator of the platform complying to PTG.3 as
            per [AIS31]. For the key generation the TOE supports “Generic Mapping” provided by the platform.
        -   Generation of Document Basic Access Keys, FCS_CKM.1 (BAC), FCS_COP.1/SHA (BAC): The TOE uses
            the cryptographic APIs provided by the underlying Secora ID S OS.
        -   Key destruction, FCS_CKM.4: The TOE uses the platform API ‘clearKey’ service to destroy session keys.
            The platform API ‘clearKey’ uses random numbers compliant to PTG.3 as per [AIS31] to overwrite the
            session keys.
        -   Provision of random numbers, as per FCS_RND.1. Authentication failure handling, FIA_AFL.1/PACE
            (SAC), FIA_AFL.1 (BAC): The TOE implements this check in such a way, that it withstands tearing events.
            A counter for unsuccessful authentication attempts is incremented before authentication is performed
            and reset in case of successful authentication.
        -   Prevention of replay attacks, FIA_UAU.4/PACE (EAC), FIA_UAU.4/PACE (SAC), FIA_UAU.4 (BAC):
            Replay attacks are prevented by the cryptographic protocol, which relies on good quality random
            numbers as required by FCS_RND.1 of this ST and supported by the underlying RNG of the platform and
            claimed in the ST of the platform with SFR FCS_RNG.1.
        -   Multiple authentication, FIA_UAU.5/PACE (EAC), FIA_UAU.5/PACE (SAC), FIA_UAU.5 (BAC): The TOE
            follows the protocol as described in [ICAO_SAC].
 SF_AA
  - Signature generation for the Active Authentication mechanism covered by FIA_API.1/AA,
     FCS_COP.1/SIG_GEN
  - Injecting private cryptographic keys used for the signatures as per FMT_MTD.1/AA
 SF_AuthPersoAgent
  - FIA_UAU.5/PACE (EAC) , FIA_UAU.5/PACE (SAC), FCS_COP.1/AUTH (BAC): The TOE uses the protocol
     scp v0.3 as per [GPv2_3_1] based on AES [FIPS_197] for authenticating the personalization agent.

   SF_SecureMessaging
    - Secure messaging, encryption/decryption, FCS_COP.1/PACE_ENC (SAC), FCS_COP.1/ENC (BAC): The
       TOE uses the proprietary PACE API from Secora ID S OS.
    - Secure messaging integrity protection, FCS_COP.1/PACE_MAC (SAC), FCS_COP.1/MAC (BAC): The TOE
       uses the underlying platform PACE dedicated API to calculate CMAC or Retail-MAC.
    - FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC (EAC), FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC (EAC) and FCS_COP.1/SIG_VER (EAC) are satisfied by
       using the standard Java Card API supported by the platform.
    - FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC (EAC) also covers to the GP scp03 used for secure card content management
       during personalization. This aspect of secure messaging by the TOE relies on the specially tailored API
       to GP SCP from the underlying platform and described in the SFR FCS_COP.1/SCP.
    - Multiple authentication, FIA_UAU.5/PACE (SAC), FIA_UAU.5 (BAC): The TOE performs a MAC check for
       every received message before instruction is executed, if the MAC check fails secure messaging is
       aborted; every response during secure messaging is MAC’ed by the TOE.
    - Re-authentication of terminal, FIA_UAU.6/EAC (EAC), FIA_UAU.6/PACE (SAC), FIA_UAU.6 (BAC): The
       TOE checks for every incoming message, whether the message is genuine (MAC check).
    - Trusted channel, FTP_ITC.1/PACE (SAC): The TOE follows the standardized implementation of the
       trusted channel according to [ICAO_SAC].

   SF_AccessControl
    - Allow specific access before user identification, FIA_UID.1/PACE (EAC), FIA_UID.1/PACE (SAC),
       FIA_UID.1 (BAC): The access rights information of the TOE grant access to EF.CardAccess (see
       [ICAO_9303_11]) and EF.ATR/INFO (see [ISO7816-4]) before PACE or BAC authentication is performed.
       The TOE allows to read a specific subset of initialization data.
    - Allow specific access before user authentication, FIA_UAU.1/PACE (EAC), FIA_UAU.1/PACE (SAC),
       FIA_UAU.1 (BAC): The access rights information of the TOE grant access to EF.CardAccess and
       EF.ATR/INFO before PACE or BAC authentication was performed. The TOE allows to read a specific
       subset of initialization data.
    - Subset and security attribute based access control, FDP_ACC.1/TRM (EAC), FDP_ACC.1/TRM (SAC),
       FDP_ACC.1 (BAC), FDP_ACF.1/TRM (EAC), FDP_ACF.1/TRM (SAC), FDP_ACF.1 (BAC), the TOE blocks
       access to EF.DG1, EF.DG2 and EF.DG5 to EF.DG16, EF.SOD and EF.COM, EF.DG3 and EF.DG4 in case BAC
       or PACE protocol is not successfully performed.
    - Residual information protection, FDP_RIP.1: as soon secure messaging is stopped, the whole secure
       messaging context including session keys is wiped with random numbers.
    - Data exchange confidentiality, FDP_UCT.1/TRM (SAC), FDP_UCT.1 (BAC): during secure messaging,
       responses by the ICC are always wrapped (encrypted and MAC’ed) before being sent.
    - Data exchange integrity, FDP_UIT.1/TRM (SAC), FDP_UIT.1 (BAC) : during secure messaging, responses
       by the ICC are always wrapped (encrypted and MAC’ed) before being sent. A MAC check is performed for
       each message received during secure messaging.
    - Storage of initialization and pre-personalisation data, FAU_SAS.1 (SAC), FAU_SAS.1/BAC (BAC):
       [PP_BAC] requests storage of IC Identification data, whereas [PP_SAC] requests storage of Initialisation
       and Pre-Personalisation data, whereby IC Identification data is a subset of Initialisation data. The TOE
       does not make any distinction, whether BAC or PACE is performed, i.e. stores all of the requested data.
       The TOE at its stage of delivery (Personalisation stage) contains a Personalisation key. The
       Personalisation agent has the option to calculate various checksums including software, file system,
       chip information and lifecycle information.
    - Management functions linked to different life cycle states, FMT_SMF.1 (SAC), FMT_SMF.1/BAC (BAC):
       The management functions “Initialization” and “pre-Personalisation” are part of the developer
       lifecycle.

   - Access is linked to security roles, FMT_SMR.1/PACE (EAC), FMT_SMR.1/PACE (SAC), FMT_SMR.1 (BAC):
     Access rights are implemented such, that they depend on lifecycle stage and authentication stage (e.g.
     whether PACE authentication or authentication as Personalisation agent was successfully performed).
     Certain commands are blocked during specific lifecycle states, such as the command to read the
     Initialisation data or update file data in operation state. Read access to specific files is granted or
     denied depending on the authentication state. Life cycle transition from Personalisation to operation
     stage can only be performed by the Personalisation agent. A back transition is blocked.
  - Writing of initialization and pre-personalisation data restricted to manufacturer, FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA:
     during Personalisation and operation there is no command available to write initialization data (e.g.
     create files). Card manager keys can be updated in personalization phase. Note that personalization
     keys are the card manager/ issuer security domain key and therefore are not owned by the applet.
  - Reading of initialization and pre-personalisation data restricted to Personalisation agent,
     FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS (SAC) and Disabling of Read Access to Initialization Data to the Personalisation
     agent FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS/BAC (BAC): Although these two SFRs have slightly different meanings, the
     TOE generally blocks reading of initialization and pre-Personalisation data in operation mode. Only the
     Personalisation agent is granted to set the lifecycle state from Personalisation to operation. A back
     transition is blocked.
  - Reading of EAC, PACE or BAC keys and Personalisation agent key not possible, FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ
     (EAC), FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ (SAC), FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ/BAC (BAC): The Personalisation key,
     PACE passwords, Document Basic Access Keys for BAC, Chip Authentication Private Key for EAC are
     stored in a special key storage within the platform, which only allows to handle this key by reference;
     no read access is performed by the application.
  - Only Personalisation agent allowed to write Document Security Object (SOD), FMT_MTD.1/PA: In
     operation mode the “STORE DATA” command is blocked.
  - Only Personalisation agent allowed to write Document Basic Access Keys, FMT_MTD.1/KEY_WRITE
     (BAC): in operation stage the proprietary command to write Document Basic Access Keys is blocked.
  - FMT_MTD.1.1/CVCA_INI (EAC)requires that the TSF shall restrict the ability to write the initial Country
     Verifying Certification Authority Public Key, the initial Country Verifying Certification Authority
     Certificate, and the initial Current Date to the Personalization Agent. Access over to this data is a
     subject to an access control.
  - FMT_MTD.1.1/CVCA_UPD (EAC)requires that the TSF shall restrict the ability to update the Country
     Verifying Certification Authority Public Key and the Country Verifying Certification Authority Certificate
     to the Country Verifying Certification Authority. SF_AccessControl realizes the appropriate control over
     the access rights.
  - FMT_MTD.1.1/DATE (EAC)requires that the TSF shall restrict the ability to modify the Current date to
     the Country Verifying Certification Authority, the Document Verifier, and the Domestic Extended
     Inspection System. SF_AccessControl realizes the appropriate control over the access rights.
  - FMT_MTD.1.1/CAPK (EAC)requires that the TSF shall restrict the ability to load the Chip Authentication
     Private Key to the Personalization Agent. SF_AccessControl realizes the appropriate control over the
     access rights.
  - FMT_MTD.3 (EAC) that the TSF shall ensure that only secure values of the certificate chain are accepted
     for TSF data of the Terminal Authentication Protocol and the Access Control as described in the
     refinement of the SFR.
 SF_DataProtection
  - TSF is designed, that it has limited capability and limited availability, FMT_LIM.1 (EAC), FMT_LIM.2
     (EAC), FMT_LIM.1 (SAC), FMT_LIM.1/BAC (BAC), FMT_LIM.2 (SAC), FMT_LIM.2/BAC (BAC): in
     Personalisation stage only limited test functionality is available. CRC on the personalized data groups
