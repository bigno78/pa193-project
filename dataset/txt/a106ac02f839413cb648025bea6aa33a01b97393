                 1.2 TOE Overview
                      The TOE consists of the Micro Controller and a software stack which is stored on the
                      Micro Controller and which can be executed by the Micro Controller. The software stack
                      can be further split into the following components:
                      • Firmware for booting and low level functionality of the Micro Controller (MC FW)
                        like writing to flash memory. This includes software for implementing cryptographic
                        operations, called Crypto Library.
                      • Software for implementing a Java Card Virtual Machine [15], a Java Card Runtime
                        Environment [16] and a Java Card Application Programming Interface [14], called
                        JCVM, JCRE and JCAPI.
                      • Software for implementing content management according to GlobalPlatform [17],
                        called GlobalPlatform (GP) Framework.
                      • Software for executing native libraries, called Secure Box.
                      The TOE is referred to as JCOP 4.7 SE051. The JCOP 4 Operating System (JCOP 4
                      OS) consists of the software stack without the Crypto Library (Crypto Lib) and without
                      the Micro Controller Firmware (MC FW). The TOE uses one or more communication
                      interfaces to communicate with its environment.
                      The complete TOE is depicted in Figure 1. The elements are described in more detail in
                      Section 1.3 "TOE Description".

 Figure 1. Components of the TOE

                               Figure 1 shows the components of the TOE. The TOE is a composite product on top
                               of CC certified Hardware, Firmware and Crypto Library. Part of the TOE are the JCVM,
                               JCRE, JCAPI and the GP Framework. Also included is optional functionality and the
                               Secure Box mechanism. The Secure Box Native Librarys provide native functions for
                               untrusted third parties and are not part of the TOE.
                               The figure shows Java Card applets which are small programs in Java language that can
                               be executed by the TOE, but are not part of the TOE.

                     1.2.1 Usage and Major Security Features of the TOE
                               The usage of the TOE is focused on security critical applications in small form factors.
                               One main usage scenario is the use of so called smart cards. Examples of such cards
                               are banking cards or electronic drivers’ licenses. The TOE can also be used in an
                               electronic passport. Another usage scenario is device authentication, where the TOE can
                               be used to prove the authenticity or originality of a device like an accessory for a gaming
                               console.
                               The TOE provides a variety of security features. The hardware of the Micro Controller
                               already protects against logical and physical attacks by applying various sensors to
                               detect manipulations and by processing data in ways which protect against leakage
                               of data by side channel analysis. With the software stack the TOE provides many

                 1.2.2 TOE Type
                      The TOE is a Java Card with a GP Framework. It can be used to load and execute off-
                      card verified Java Card applets.

                 1.2.3 Required non-TOE Hardware/Software/Firmware
                      Three groups of users shall be distinguished here.
                      The first group is the end-users group, which uses the TOE with one or more loaded
                      applets in the final form factor like a banking card or an electronic passport. These users
                      only require a communication device to be able to communicate with the TOE. The
                      communication protocol of the TOE is standardized in either ISO7816 [31] (T=1, T=0),
                      ISO14443 [32] (T=CL), or UM10204 [33] (I2C Slave).
                      The second group of users are administrators of cards. They want to configure the
                      card by using the Configuration Module, to install additional applets and to configure and
                      personalise these applets. These users require the same equipment as end-users.
                      The third group of users wants to develop Java Card applets and execute them on
                      the TOE. These applet developers need in addition to the communication device a
                      set of tools for the development of applets. This set of tools can be obtained from the
                      TOE vendor and comprises elements such as PC development environment, byte code
                      verifier, compiler, linker and debugger.

                     1.3 TOE Description

                    1.3.1 TOE Components and Composite Certification
                           The certification of this TOE is a composite certification. The following sections provide
                           a more detailed description of the components of Figure 1. It is also made clear whether
                           a component is covered by a previous certification or whether it is covered in the
                           certification of this TOE.

                  1.3.1.1 Micro Controller

                           The Micro Controller is a secure smart card controller from NXP’s SmartMX3 family.
                           The Micro Controller contains a co-processor for symmetric cryptographic operations,
                           supporting DES and AES, as well as an accelerator for asymmetric cryptographic
                           algorithms. The Micro Controller further contains a physical random number generator.
                           The supported memory technologies are volatile (Random Access Memory (RAM)) and
                           non-volatile (Read Only Memory (ROM) and FLASH) memory.
                           Access to all memory types is controlled by a Memory Management Unit (MMU) which
                           allows to separate and restrict access to parts of the memory.
                           The Micro Controller has been certified in a previous certification and the results are re-
                           used for this certification. The exact reference to the previous certification is given in the
                           following Table 2 "Reference to Certified Micro Controller":

                           Table 2. Reference to Certified Micro Controller

                                                                          [1]

                           Certification ID                BSI-DSZ-CC-1040
                           Reference                       [10]

                           [1]   The SE051 hardware is an instantiation of the N7121 hard macro with I2C side-car.


                  1.3.1.2 Security IC Dedicated Software

                 1.3.1.2.1 MC FW (Micro Controller Firmware)

                           The Micro Controller Firmware is used for testing of the Micro Controller at production,
                           for booting of the Micro Controller after power-up or after reset, for configuration of
                           communication devices and for writing data to volatile and non-volatile memory.
                           The MC FW has been certified together with the Micro Controller and the same reference
                           [10] as given for the Micro Controller also apply for the MC FW.

                 1.3.1.2.2 Crypto Library

                           The Crypto Library provides implementations for symmetric and asymmetric
                           cryptographic operations, hashing, the generation of hybrid deterministic and hybrid
                           physical random numbers and further functions like secure copy and compare.
                           Some of the cryptographic algorithms offered by the Crypto Lib are not certified, see
                           Section 1.3.1.4 "Excluded functionality".
                           The symmetric cryptographic operations comprise the algorithms 3DES and AES. These
                           algorithms use the symmetric co-processor of the Micro Controller.

                          The supported asymmetric cryptographic operations are ECC and RSA. These
                          algorithms use the Public Key Crypto Coprocessor (PKCC) of the Micro Controller for the
                          cryptographic operations.
                          The Crypto Library has been certified together with the Micro Controller and the same
                          reference [10] as given for the Micro Controller also applies.

                  1.3.1.3 Security IC Embedded Software

                 1.3.1.3.1 JCOP 4.7 SE051

                          The OS of the TOE consists of JCVM, JCRE, JCAPI and GP framework. It is
                          implemented according to the Java Card Specification and GlobalPlatform. Additionally it
                          consists of a proprietary API, which is described in the UGM [9].
                          The TOE can be identified by using the IDENTIFY APDU command (see UGM [9]). This
                          command returns the card identification data, which includes a Platform ID, a Patch ID
                          and other information that allows to identify the content in ROM, FLASH and loaded
                          patches (if any).
                          The TOE also includes a Configuration Module (see Section 1.3.2 "Optional TOE
                          Functionality") which is used for personalisation and configuration of the TOE. It must be
                          deleted after the personalisation is finished (end of Phase 6 ”Personalisation”) by using
                          the DELETE APDU command. Once the Configuration Module is deleted, it is no longer
                          possible to configure the TOE.
                          The TOE contains further functionality for integrity protection of user data via an
                          EDC, encryption of user data via PUF [12] and optional functionality as described in
                          Section 1.3.2 "Optional TOE Functionality".

                  1.3.1.4 Excluded functionality

                          All Secure Box Native Libraries are not part of the TOE. No security functional
                          requirements are claimed on AES CCM, HMAC, HKDF, ECDAA, elliptic curve
                          cryptography based on Edwards and Montgomery curves and FIPS self-tests, they are

                  1.3.3 TOE Reduced Feature Set
                        The TOE is also available to customers with a reduced feature set. This variant of the
                        TOE contains a different base mask configuraton and has some features removed from
                        the TOE. The removed features are:
                        •   No support for SecureBox
                        •   No RSA support in GP
                        •   No DES support in GP
                        •   SCP01 not supported
                        •   SCP02 not supported
                        •   GP CVM service not supported
                        •   GP command chaining is not supported
                        •   ISO 7816 T=1, T=0 (UART) interface not supported
                        The base mask with the reduced feature set is known as IOT Reduced, while the base
                        mask with full functionality is known as IOT Full. For more information on the difference
                        in feature set, please refer to Table 3.1 in the User Guidance and Administration Manual
                        [9].

                 1.3.3.1 Reduced Security Functional Requirements

                        Some security functionality claimed in this Security Target is no longer available in the
                        IOT Reduced base mask or has limited functionality and the corresponding Security
                        Functional Requirements are not (completely) applicable for this variant of the TOE. The

                      The evaluation process is limited to phases 1 to 5. User Applet development is outside
                      the scope of this evaluation. Applets can be loaded into FLASH in phases 3, 4, 5, and 6.
                      Applet loading in phase 7 is also allowed. This means post-issuance loading of applets
                      can be done for a certified TOE.
                      The Configuration Module is loaded into FLASH and has special privileges to personalize
                      and configure the TOE. Before life cycle Phase 7 "Operational Use" the Configuration
                      Module is deleted and hence it is ensured that its functionality cannot be used
                      afterwards. It is possible to load patch code into FLASH in phases 3, 4, 5, and 6. The
                      certification is only valid for the ROM code having the Platform Identifiers and the Patch
                      IDs (if applicable) as stated in Table 5 "Delivery Items".
                      The delivery process from NXP to their customers (to phase 4 or phase 5 of the life
                      cycle) guarantees that the customer is aware of the exact versions of the different parts
                      of the TOE as outlined above.

                         DIAG, A.USE_KEYS) that users handle securely the TOE and related Objectives for the
                         environment are defined (OE.USE_DIAG, OE.USE_KEYS).

                 1.3.5.2 TOE Identification

                         The TOE can be identified by using the Platform ID, the FLASH ID and the Patch ID. The
                         IDENTIFY command and the identification output for this TOE are described in detail
                         in Chapter 2 of the UGM [9]. The IDENTIFY command also returns information about
                         presence of optional functionality and allows to identify the IOT Full and IOT Reduced
                         base mask configuration.

                  1.3.6 Evaluated Package Types
                         A number of package types are supported for this TOE. All package types, which are
                         covered by the certification of the used hardware (see [10]), are also allowed to be used
                         in combination with each product of this TOE.
                         The package types do not influence the security functionality of the TOE. They only
                         define which pads are connected in the package and for what purpose and in which
                         environment the chip can be used. Note that the security of the TOE is not dependent on

2       Conformance Claims (ASE_CCL)
                      This Chapter is divided into the following sections: "CC Conformance Claim", "Package
                      Claim", "PP Claim", and "Conformance Claim Rationale".

                  2.1 CC Conformance Claim
                      This Security Target claims to be conformant to version 3.1 of Common Criteria for
                      Information Technology Security Evaluation according to
                      • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 1, Version 3.1,
                        Revision 5, April 2017" [1]
                      • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 2, Version 3.1,
                        Revision 5, April 2017" [2]
                      • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 3, Version 3.1,
                        Revision 5, April 2017" [3]
                      The following methodology will be used for the evaluation:
                      • Common Methodology for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Evaluation
                        Methodology, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April 2017" [4]
                      This Security Target claims to be CC Part 2 extended and CC Part 3 conformant.
                      The extended Security Functional Requirements are defined in Section 6 "Extended
                      Components Definition (ASE_ECD)".

                  2.2 Package Claim
                      This Security Target claims conformance to the assurance package EAL6. The
                      augmentation to EAL6 is ASE_TSS.2 “TOE summary specification with architectural
                      design summary” and ALC_FLR.1 “Basic flaw remediation”.

                  2.3 PP Claim
                      The Security Target claims demonstrable conformance to the Java Card System -
                      Open Configuration Protection Profile, December 2017, Version 3.0.5 [6], certified by
                      Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI, BSI-CC-PP-0099-2017). The
                      Java Card Protection Profile makes the use of Java Card RMI optional. The TOE does
                      not support Java Card RMI. This ST is more restrictive than the PP [6] which Section 2.4
                      "Conformance Claim Rationale" provides a rational for.

                  2.4 Conformance Claim Rationale

                 2.4.1 TOE Type
                      The TOE type as stated in Section Section 1.2 "TOE Overview" of this ST corresponds
                      to the TOE type of the PP as stated in Section 2.1 of [6] namely a Java Card platform,
                      implementing the Java Card Specification Version 3.0.5 [15], [16], [14].

                  2.4.2 SPD Statement

                 2.4.2.1 Threats

                         The Security Problem Definition (SPD) statement that is presented in Section 4 "Security
                         Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)" includes the threats as presented in the PP [6], but also
                         includes additional threats. These threats are:
                         •   T.OS_OPERATE
                         •   T.RND
                         •   T.COM_EXPLOIT
                         •   T.LIFE_CYCLE
                         •   T.UNAUTHORIZED_CARD_MNGT
                         •   T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA[REFINED]
                         •   T.CONFIG
                         •   T.SEC_BOX_BORDER
                         •   T.MODULE_EXEC
                         •   T.MODULE_REPLACEMENT
                         The threat T.OS_OPERATE is an additional threat added to cover incorrect operating
                         system behavior, it is an addition to the threats in the PP [6].
                         The threat T.RND is taken from the Security IC PP [5].
                         The threat T.COM_EXPLOIT is included to cover communication channels attacks and it
                         is an addition to the threats in the PP [6].
                         The threat T.LIFE_CYCLE is included to cover content management attacks and it is an
                         addition to the threats in the PP [6].
                         The threat T.UNAUTHORIZED_CARD_MNGT refines the threats T.INSTALL and
                         T.DELETION from the Security IC PP [5].
                         The threat T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA[REFINED] refines the threat T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA in
                         the Security IC PP [5].
                         The threat T.CONFIG is an additional threat to cover unauthorized modifications and
                         read access of the configuration area in the TOE. It is an addition to the threats defined in
                         the PP [6].
                         The threat T.SEC_BOX_BORDER is included for the Secure Box which is additional
                         functionality the PP [6] allows.
                         The threats T.MODULE_EXEC and T.MODULE_REPLACEMENT are included for the
                         Modular Design which is additional functionality the PP [6] allows. Furthermore some
                         threats from the PP [6] are refined to cover additional assets from the Modular Design.
                         This comprises threats T.CONFID-JCS-CODE, T.CONFID-JCS-DATA, T.INTEG-APPLI-
                         CODE, T.INTEG-JCS-CODE, T.INTEG-JCS-DATA, and T.SID.1.
                         Note that the threat T.EXE-CODE-REMOTE is not included, since the TOE does not
                         support Java Card RMI. The Java Card Protection Profile [6] makes the use of Java Card
                         RMI optional.

                        The OSP OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS is introduced for the SD feature of the TOE and is
                        an addition to the OSPs in PP [6].
                        The OSP.SECURE-BOX is introduced to allow execution of third party native code and is
                        an addition to the OSPs in PP [6].

                 2.4.2.3 Assumptions

                        The SPD statement includes two of the three assumptions from the PP [6]. The
                        assumption A.Deletion is excluded. The Card Manager is part of the TOE and therefore
                        the assumption is no longer relevant. Leaving out the assumption, makes the SPD of this
                        ST more restrictive than the SPD in the PP [6]. As the Card Manager is part of the TOE,
                        it is ensuring that the deletion of applets through the Card Manager is secure, instead of
                        assuming that it is handled by the Card Manager in the environment of the TOE.
                        Besides the assumptions from the PP [6], following additional assumptions are added:
                        •   A.PROCESS-SEC-IC
                        •   A.USE_DIAG
                        •   A.USE_KEYS
                        •   A.APPS-PROVIDER
                        •   A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY
                        The assumption A.PROCESS-SEC-IC is taken from the underlying certified Micro
                        Controller [10], which is compliant to the Security IC PP [5].
                        The assumptions A.USE_DIAG and A.USE_KEYS are included because the Card
                        Manager is part of the TOE and no longer part of the environment.
                        The assumptions A.APPS-PROVIDER and A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY are added
                        because Security Domains from the GlobalPlatform Specification are introduced. All the
                        applets and packages are signed by the Application Provider Security Domain (APSD)
                        and the correctness is verified on the TOE by Verification Authority Security Domain
                        (VASD) before the package or applet is installed or loaded. A.APPS-PROVIDER and
                        A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY are additions to PP [6] for card content management
                        environment.

                  2.4.3 Security Objectives Statement
                        The statement of security objectives in the ST presented in Section 5 "Security
                        Objectives" includes all security objectives as presented in the PP [6], but also includes a
                        number of additional security objectives. These security objectives are:
                        • OT.IDENTIFICATION
                        • OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS
                        • OT.APPLI-AUTH

                      •   OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION
                      The security objective OT.IDENTIFICATION is part of the security objectives of the
                      certified Micro Controller [10] (see also Section 1.3.1.1 "Micro Controller") and Crypto
                      Lib [10] (see also Section 1.3.1.2.2 "Crypto Library"), which are also components of this
                      composite certification. Therefore the security objective statement is equivalent to the PP
                      [6] for these two security objectives. OT.IDENTIFICATION is also included for the pre-
                      personalisation feature of the TOE, which is additional functionality the PP allows.
                      The security objectives OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS, OT.APPLI-AUTH, OT.COMM_AUTH,
                      OT.COMM_INTEGRITY, OT.COMM_CONFIDENTIALITY are objectives for the TOE as
                      the GlobalPlatform API and the definitions for Secure Channel, Security Domains and
                      Card Content Management are used from it.
                      The security objectives OT.CARD-CONFIGURATION, OT.SECURE_LOAD_ACODE,
                      OT.SECURE_ACTIVATION_ADDITIONAL_CODE, OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION are
                      related to the configuration of the TOE via the Configuration Module, which is additional
                      functionality the PP [6] allows.
                      The security objective OT.SEC_BOX_FW is related to the Secure Box, which is
                      additional functionality the PP allows.
                      The security objective OT.SID_MODULE is related to the Modular Design of the TOE,
                      which is additional functionality the PP [6] allows.
                      The security objective OT.RNG is related to the Random Number Generator, and is
                      taken from the Security IC PP [5].
                      The ST contains OE.APPLET, OE.VERIFICATION and OE.CODE-EVIDENCE from
                      Security Objectives for the Operational Environment from [6]. Additionally, some of the
                      Security Objectives for the Operational Environment from [6] are listed as TOE Security

                          Dependencies:                    No dependencies.

1.3 TOE Overview
The Security Target (ST) defines the security objectives and requirements for a
contact or contactless based chip of machine readable travel documents (MRTD)
based on the requirements and recommendations of the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO), EU requirements for biometric European passport
(Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 and Commission Implementing Decision
6181) and Biometric European Resident Permit (REGULATION (EU) 2017/1954
and Commission Implementing Decision 6178). This product is intended to
enable verification of the authenticity of the travel document and to identify its
holder during a border control, using an inspection system. The verification
process is based on Extended Access Control with Password Authenticated
Connection Establishment (PACE) and optionally Active Authentication (AA).

The main features and their origin are the following:
 Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
   according to ICAO Technical Report “Supplemental Access Control” [ICAO-
   9303] part 11 and strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0068-V2 [PACE-PP] for
   protection of the communication between terminal and chip. The following
   PACE mapping modes are supported and covered by the TOE:
      o    Generic Mapping (PACE-GM)
      o    Integrated Mapping (PACE-IM)
      o    Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM), which combines PACE-GM
           with Chip Authentication into a single protocol.

    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    travel document’s chip to the inspection system.
   Terminal Authentication v1
    according to BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1], [TR-03110-3] and
    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    inspection system to travel document’s chip and protects the confidentiality
    and integrity of the sensitive biometric reference data during their
    transmission from the TOE to the inspection system.

As a feature that can be optionally configured the TOE supports:
   Active Authentication
    which according to [ICAO-9303] prevents copying the SOD and proves that it
    has been read from the authentic chip. It proves that the chip has not been
    substituted.


   Polymorphic Authentication
    which according to [PCA-eMRTD] provides additional privacy by randomisation
    of returned Polymorphic Identities, Polymorphic Pseudonyms and
    Complementary Polymorphic ID attributes in combination`with standard ICAO
    and EAC1 eMRTD protocols specified in ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] and BSI
    TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1] and [TR 03110-3].

The TOE may also be used as an ISO driving license, compliant to ISO/IEC 18013
or ISO/IEC TR 19446 supporting PACE, AA and CA, as both applications (MRTD
and IDL) share the same protocols and data structure organization. Therefore, in
the rest of the document, the word “MRTD” MAY be understood either as a MRTD
in the sense of ICAO, or a driving license compliant to ISO/IEC 18013 or ISO/IEC
TR 19446 depending on the targeted usage envisioned by the issuer.

Application note
This TOE claims an assurance level EAL5 augmented with AVA_VAN.5 and
ALC_DVS.2. AVA_VAN.5 implies that the TOE is resistant to attacks performed by
an attacker possessing "High attack potential".
Not all key sizes specified in this security target have sufficient cryptographic
strength for satisfying the AVA_VAN.5 “high attack potential”. In order to be
protected against attackers with a "high attack potential", sufficiently large
cryptographic key sizes SHALL be configured for this TOE. References can be
found in national and international document standards. Further details have
been specified in the TOE’s guidance documentation [AGD_PRE].

[TR-03110] have also been refered to in ISO18013 for EU driving licences. The
BAP-1 protocol defined in ISO18013 is equal to Basic Access Protocol (BAC)
defined in [ICAO-9303]. As to the logical data structure, the ISO18013 uses the
same concept of Passive Authentication defined in [ICAO-9303], but specifies
different ISO7816-4 elementary file identifiers for storing the ICAO defined
content of DG3, DG4 and DG15.

Polymorphic eMRTD.


1.4.2.1 ICAO/EAC eMRTD and ISO Driving licence
This sub section explains the TOE security features for operational use of TOE
configured as ICAO/EAC eMRTD or as Driving Licence.

A State or Organisation issues travel documents to be used by the holder for
international travel. The traveller presents a travel document to the inspection
system to prove his or her identity. The travel document in context of this
Security Target contains:
  I.  visual (eye readable) biographical data and portrait of the holder,
 II.  a separate data summary (MRZ data) for visual and machine reading using
       OCR methods in the Machine readable zone (MRZ) and
III.  data elements on the travel document’s chip according to LDS in case of
       contactless machine reading.

The authentication of the traveller is based on:
  I.  the possession of a valid travel document personalized for a holder with
      the claimed identity as given on the biographical data page and
 II.  biometrics using the reference data stored in the travel document.

The issuing State or Organization ensures the authenticity of the data of genuine
travel documents. The receiving State trusts a genuine travel document of an
issuing State or Organization.

For this Security Target the travel document is viewed as unit of:
(i) the physical part of the travel document in form of paper and/or plastic
    and chip. It presents visual readable data including (but not limited to)
    personal data of the travel document holder
    (a) the biographical data on the biographical data page of the travel
         document surface,
    (b) the printed data in the Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) and
    (c) the printed portrait.

(ii) the logical travel document as data of the travel document holder stored
     according to the Logical Data Structure as defined in [ICAO-9303] as specified
     by ICAO on the contact based or contactless integrated circuit. It presents
     contact based / contactless readable data including(but not limited to)
     personal data of the travel document holder
     (a) the digital Machine Readable Zone Data (digital MRZ data, EF.DG1),
     (b) the digitized portraits (EF.DG2),
     (c) the biometric reference data of finger(s) (EF.DG3) or iris image(s)
          (EF.DG4) or both1,
     (d) the other data according to LDS (EF.DG5 to EF.DG16) and
     (e) the Document Security Object (SOD).


The issuing State or Organisation implements security features of the travel
document to maintain the authenticity and integrity of the travel document and
their data. The physical part of the travel document and the travel document’s
chip are identified by the Document Number.

The physical part of the travel document is protected by physical security
measures (e.g. watermark, security printing), logical (e.g. authentication keys of
the travel document’s chip) and organisational security measures (e.g. control of
materials, personalisation procedures) [ICAO-9303].These security measures can
include the binding of the travel document’s chip to the travel document.

The logical travel document is protected in authenticity and integrity by a digital
signature created by the document signer acting for the issuing State or
Organisation and the security features of the travel document’s chip.

The ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] defines the baseline security methods Passive
Authentication, advanced security access methods Basic Access Control (BAC)
and Password Authenticated Connection Establishment to the logical travel



These biometric reference data are optional according to [ICAO-9303]. This ST assumes that the issuing State or
1

Organisation uses this option and protects these data by means of extended access control.

document, Active Authentication of the travel document’s chip, Extended Access
Control and the Data Encryption of sensitive biometrics as optional security
measure. The Passive Authentication Mechanism is performed completely and
independently of the TOE by the TOE environment.

The BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1] and [TR 03110-3] specify the
Extended Access Control protocols Chip Authentication version 1 (CAv1) and
Terminal Authentication (TAv1), which are required to get secured access to the
biometric data stored in data groups DG3 and DG4 in combination with PACE or
BAC.

This Security Target addresses the protection of the logical travel document:
   (i) in integrity by write-only-once access control and by physical means, and
   (ii) in confidentiality by the Extended Access Control Mechanism.

This Security Target addresses the Chip Authentication Version 1 described in
[TR-03110-1] and PACE-CAM described in [ICAO-9303] part 11 as an alternative
to the Active Authentication stated in [ICAO-9303].

For Basic Access Control (BAC) supported by the product, a separate evaluation
and certification is performed with ST [ST-BAC].

The confidentiality by Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
is a mandatory security feature of the TOE. The travel document shall strictly
conform to the ‘Common Criteria Protection Profile Machine Readable Travel
Document using Standard Inspection Procedure with PACE [PACE-PP]. Note that
[PACE-PP] considers high attack potential.

For the PACE protocol according to [ICAO-9303] part 11, the following steps shall
be performed:
 (i) the travel document's chip encrypts a nonce with the shared password,
       derived from the MRZ resp. CAN data and transmits the encrypted nonce
       together with the domain parameters to the terminal.
 (ii) The terminal recovers the nonce using the shared password, by
       (physically) reading the MRZ or CAN data. This nonce shall be converted to
       a group generator using one of the following mapping algorithms, which
       maps a static generator to an ephemeral generator:
           a. Generic mapping (PACE-GM) or
           b. Integrated mapping PACE-IM)
 (iii) The travel document's chip and terminal computer perform a Diffie-
       Hellmann key agreement together with the ephemeral domain parameters
       to create a shared secret. Both parties derive the session keys KMAC and
       KENC from the shared secret.
 (iv) Each party generates an authentication token, sends it to the other party
       and verifies the received token.

In case of PACE with Chip Authenticated Mapping (PACE-CAM), in addition to the
steps above executed for the PACE-GM variant, the MRTD chip computes Chip
Authentication Data CAIC, encrypts them AIC = E(KSEnc, CAIC) and sends them

to the terminal. The terminal decrypts AIC and verifies the authenticity of the
chip using the recovered Chip Authentication Data CAIC.

After successful key negotiation, the terminal and the travel document's chip
provide private communication (secure messaging) [TR-03110-1], [ICAO-9303].

This Security Target requires the TOE to implement the Extended Access Control
as defined in [TR-03110-1]. The Extended Access Control consists of two parts:
  (i) the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1 and
  (ii) the Terminal Authentication Protocol Version 1 (v.1).

The Chip Authentication Protocol v.1
  (i) authenticates the travel document’s chip to the inspection system and
  (ii) establishes secure messaging which is used by Terminal Authentication v.1
       to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the sensitive biometric
       reference data during their transmission from the TOE to the inspection
       system. Therefore Terminal Authentication v.1 can only be performed if
       Chip Authentication v.1has been successfully executed.

The Terminal Authentication Protocolv.1 consists of
  (i) the authentication of the inspection system as entity authorized by the
       receiving State or Organisation through the issuing State, and
  (ii) an access control by the TOE to allow reading the sensitive biometric
       reference data only to successfully authenticated authorized inspection
       systems.

The Active Authentication protocol may be optionally configured during
personalisation.

The issuing State or Organisation authorizes the receiving State by means of
certification the authentication public keys of Document Verifiers who create
Inspection System Certificates.


1.4.2.2 Polymorphic eMRTD

In addition to an ICAO/EAC eMRTD functionality, the TOE supports Polymorphic
eMRTD extensions that can be configured using the same applet during
personalisation. The TOE’s Polymorphic eMRTD extensions enable secure
authentication with enhanced privacy protection features. The Polymorphic
extensions provide the holder the possibility to authenticate towards a service
provider using an authentication service in a non-traceable and non-linkable
manner thanks to usage of Polymorphic ID attributes.

The Polymorphic extensions are used to configure a Polymorphic eMRTD as stand
alone application instance or next to an ICAO/EAC eMRTD/Driving application
licence instance having its own application identifier during personalisation.

                        eMRTD Configuration)

The Polymorphic eMRTD uses the same ICAO and EAC1 protocols like PACEv2,
Chip Authentication v1 (CAv1) and Terminal Authentication (v1) as defined in
[ICAO-9303], [TR-03110-1] and [TR-03110-3]. The TOE’s Polymorphic eMRTD
extensions provide the following features:

      Secure storage of the Polymorphic ID attributes during personalisation or
       the TOE.
      Polymorphic Authentication Protocol (PMA) for authenticated access with
       user consent, randomization and secure readout of the Polymorphic ID
       attributes, in combination with PACEv2 and EAC1 eMRTD protocols.
      PACEv2 protocol extended with PIN and PUK passwords, to enforce user
       authentication (document holder verification) in compliance with [TR-
       03101-3].

For Polymorphic eMRTD, the PACE protocol is configured with PIN, PUK and CAN
passwords in compliance with [TR-03110-3] during personalisation. Only PACE-
GM and PACE-IM are configurable for a Polymorphic eMRTD.

The Active Authentication protocol shall not be configured for a polymorphic
eMRTD.

The logical data structure consists only of EF.CVCA, DG14 and EF.SOD. In order
to assure a sufficient level of privacy during authentication the CAv1 private key
and EF.SOD are shared amoung a sufficient high number of personalised
Polymorphic eMRTDs, i.e. the logical data structure does not contain any unique
identifiable data.



1.4.3 TOE life cycle
The TOE life cycle is described in terms of its four life cycle phases. (With respect
to the [SIC-PP], the TOE life-cycle is additionally subdivided into 7 steps in the
ST. These steps are denoted too in the following although the sequence of the
steps differs for the TOE life cycle).

1.4.3.1 Phase 1 “Development”
(Step1) The TOE is developed in phase 1. The IC developer develops the
integrated circuit, the IC Dedicated Software and the guidance documentation
associated with these TOE components.
The IC developer also acts as the developer of the embedded software (operating
system), which is the NXP JCOP 3 P60.

(Step2) The software developer uses the guidance documentation for the
integrated circuit and the guidance documentation for relevant parts of the NXP
JCOP 3 P60 and develops the ePassport application and the guidance
documentation associated with this TOE component.

The ePassport application (i.e. the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
(SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet run time code) may be
integrated either in ROM or in EEPROM of the chip. Depending on the intention:
      (a) the ePassport application is securely delivered directly from the
          software developer (IDEMIA development dept.) to the IC manufacturer
          (NXP). The applet code will be integrated into the ROM mask code or
          inEEPROM by the IC manufacturer, or
      (b) the ePassport application is securely delivered directly from the
          software developer (IDEMIA development dept.) to the travel document
          manufacturer (IDEMIA production dept.) .) for loading in EEPROM.

Notice that the guidance documentation of the ePassport application is always
securely delivered directly from the software developer (IDEMIA development
dept.) to the travel document manufacturer (IDEMIA production dept.).


1.4.3.2 Phase 2 “Manufacturing”
(Step3) In a first step the TOE integrated circuit is produced containing the travel
document’s chip Dedicated Software, the parts of the travel document’s chip
Embedded Software and in case of alternative a) the ePassport application in
ROM or in EEPROM.

The IC manufacturer writes the IC Identification Data onto the chip to control the
IC as travel document material during the IC manufacturing and the delivery
process to the travel document manufacturer. The IC is securely delivered from
the IC manufacturer to the travel document manufacturer.

                           eMRTD Configuration)

If necessary the IC manufacturer adds the parts of the IC Embedded Software in
the non-volatile programmable memories (for instance EEPROM).

(Step4 optional) The travel document manufacturer combines the IC with
hardware for the contact based / contactless interface in the travel document
unless the travel document consist of the chip only.

(Step5) The travel document manufacturer
  i.  adds the IC Embedded Software or part of it in the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM) if necessary and in case
      of alternative (b), loads the ePassport application into the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM),
 ii.      creates the ePassport application and
iii.      equips travel document’s chips with pre-personalization Data.

EAC PP Application Note 1: Creation of the application for this TOE implies
Applet instantiation.

For this Security Target the following name mappings to the protection profile
[EAC-PP-V2] apply:
    IC Dedicated SW = Low level IC libraries
    travel document’s chip Embedded Software = NXP JCOP 3 P60 operating
       system.
    ePassport application = IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
       (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet run time code or an
       instantiation of it.
    Pre-personalization Data = Personalization Agent Key Set, Card Production
       Life Cycle (CPLC) data and buffer settings.

Both the underlying platform and IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
(SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet provide configuration and
life-cycle management functions required for TOE preparation. TOE preparation
steps are performed in manufacturing phase and consist of the following 2
activities:
    1. Platform initialisation
       2. Pre-personalisation

Platform initialisation
Platform initialisation consists of the configuration of the NXP JCOP 3 P60 in
accordance with requirements specified in the platform administrator guidance
[PLTF-PRE] by using the dedicated platform commands. Furthermore the Pre-
Personalisation Agent key set is installed and (a part of) the CPLC data is
updated. To prevent unattended tracing of the MRTD document, the NXP JCOP 3
P60 is configured such that unauthenticated access to any platform unique
idenfiable data is not possible.

                              eMRTD Configuration)

Pre-personalisation
The pre-personalisation consists of the following steps:
   a. IC (chip) Authentication and getting chip access with the pre-
      personalisation key set.
   b. [optional] In case the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
      (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet runtime code does
      not reside in ROM, it is loaded into EEPROM.
   c. Install the applet application instances depending on the desired TOE
      configuration specified in section 1.4.2, using IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with
      Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet.
   d. Set the ePassport (and if present) the Polymorphic eMRTD applet
      irreversibly in its PERSONALISATION life-cycle state by installation of the
      Personalisation Agent specific personalisation key set(s).

During step (c) the CPLC data with the IC Identifier as well as the other pre-
personalisation data is configured in the TOE. The last step (d) finalizes the TOE.
This is the moment the TOE starts to exist and is ready for delivery to the
Personalisation Agent. The guidance documentation for the Personalisation Agent

1.4.3.3 Phase 3 “Personalisation of the travel document”
(Step 6) The personalisation of the travel document includes
  i.  the survey of the MRTD holder’s biographical data,
 ii.   the enrolment of the MRTD holder biometric reference data (i.e. the
       digitized portraits and the optional biometric reference data),
iii.   the printing of the visual readable data onto the physical MRTD,
iv.    the writing of the TOE User Data and TSF Data into the logical MRTD and
 v.    configuration of the TSF if necessary.

The step (iv) is performed by the Personalisation Agent and includes but is not
limited to the creation of:
  i.   the digital MRZ data (EF.DG1),
 ii.   the digitized portrait (EF.DG2), and
iii.   the Document security object.

The signing of the Document security object by the Document signer [ICAO-
9303] finalizes the personalisation of the genuine travel document for the travel
document holder. The personalised travel document (together with appropriate
guidance (AGD_OPE) for TOE usage if necessary) is handed over to the travel
document holder for operational use.

The personalisation of Polymorphic eMRTD application instance includes:

 i.    establishing the identity of the polymorphic eMRTD document holder,
 ii.   Requesting the required Polymorphic eMRTD ID attributes from the central
       Key Management authority,
iii.   writing Polymorphic ID attributes, Polymorphic LDS data as defined in
       [PCA-eMRTD],
iv.    writing the TSF data (PIN, PUK, CAv1 private key) as defined in [PCA-
       eMRTD],
 v.    signing the Document Security Object defined in
       [ICAO-9303] (in the role of DS).


The signing of the Document security object by the Document signer [ICAO-
9303] finalizes the personalisation of the genuine Polymorphic eMRTD document
for the travel document holder. The personalised Polymorphic eMRTD document
(together with appropriate guidance (AGD_OPE) for TOE usage if necessary) is
handed over to the Polymorphic eMRTD document holder for operational use.

limited to) the Personalisation Agent Authentication Key(s), the Terminal
Authentication trust anchor, the effective date and the Chip Authentication
Private Key.

EAC PP Application note 3: This ST distinguishes between the Personalisation
Agent as entity known to the TOE and the Document Signer as entity in the TOE
IT environment signing the Document security object as described in [ICAO-
9303]. This approach allows but does not enforce the separation of these roles.


1.4.3.4 Phase 4 “Operational Use”
(Step 7) The TOE is used as a travel document's chip by the traveller and the
inspection systems in the “Operational Use” phase. The user data can be read
according to the security policy of the issuing State or Organisation and can be
used according to the security policy of the issuing State but they can never be
modified.

EAC PP Application note 42: The intention of the ST is to consider at least the
phases 1 and parts of phase 2 (i.e. Step1 to Step3) as part of the evaluation and
therefore to define the TOE delivery according to CC after this phase. Since
specific production steps of phase 2 are of minor security relevance (e.g. booklet
manufacturing and antenna integration) these are not part of the CC evaluation
under ALC. Nevertheless the decision about this has to be taken by the
certification body resp. the national body of the issuing State or Organisation. In
this case the national body of the issuing State or Organisation is responsible for
these specific production steps.
Note that the personalisation process and its environment may depend on
specific security needs of an issuing State or Organisation. All production,
generation and installation procedures after TOE delivery up to the “Operational
Use” (phase 4) have to be considered in the product evaluation process under
AGD assurance class. Therefore, the Security Target outlines the split up of
P.Manufact, P.Personalisation and the related security objectives into aspects
relevant before vs. after TOE delivery.


1.4.3.5 Non-TOE hardware/software/firmware required by the TOE
There is no explicit non-TOE hardware, software or firmware required by the TOE
to perform its claimed security features. The TOE is defined to comprise the chip
and the complete operating system and application. Note, the inlay holding the
chip as well as the antenna and the booklet (holding the printed MRZ) are
needed to represent a complete travel document. Nevertheless, these parts are
not inevitable for the secure operation of the TOE.




2
 For this ST all steps of both phase 1 and phase 2 are part of the evaluation and therefore define the TOE
delivery according to the CC evaluation after this phase.

                          FPT_EMSEC.1.2                    The TSF shall ensure [assignment: that unauthorized users]

                          Hierarchical to:                 No other components.

                          Dependencies:                    No dependencies.

                          FPT_PHP.3.1                      The TSF shall resist [assignment: physical manipulation and
                                                           physical probing] to the [assignment: TSF] by responding
                                                           automatically such that the SFRs are always enforced.

                          Refinement:                      The TSF will implement appropriate mechanisms to continuously
                                                           counter physical manipulation and physical probing. Due to the
                                                           nature of these attacks (especially manipulation) the TSF can
                                                           by no means detect attacks on all of its elements. Therefore,
                                                           permanent protection against these attacks is required ensuring
                                                           that security functional requirements are enforced. Hence,
                                                           ”automatic response” means here (i) assuming that there might
                                                           be an attack at any time and (ii) countermeasures are provided at
                                                           any time.

1.3 TOE Overview
The Security Target (ST) defines the security objectives and requirements for a
contact or contactless based chip of machine readable travel documents (MRTD)
based on the requirements and recommendations of the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO), EU requirements for biometric European passport
(Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 and Commission Implementing Decision
6181) and Biometric European Resident Permit (REGULATION (EU) 2017/1954
and Commission Implementing Decision 6178). This product is intended to
enable verification of the authenticity of the travel document and to identify its
holder during a border control, using an inspection system. The verification
process is based on Extended Access Control with Password Authenticated
Connection Establishment (PACE) and optionally Active Authentication (AA).

The main features and their origin are the following:
 Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
   according to ICAO Technical Report “Supplemental Access Control” [ICAO-
   9303] part 11 and strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0068-V2 [PACE-PP] for
   protection of the communication between terminal and chip. The following
   PACE mapping modes are supported and covered by the TOE:
      o    Generic Mapping (PACE-GM)
      o    Integrated Mapping (PACE-IM)
      o    Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM), which combines PACE-GM
           with Chip Authentication into a single protocol.

   Chip Authentication v1
    according to BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1], [TR-03110-3] and
    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    travel document’s chip to the inspection system.
   Terminal Authentication v1
    according to BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1], [TR-03110-3] and
    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    inspection system to travel document’s chip and protects the confidentiality
    and integrity of the sensitive biometric reference data during their
    transmission from the TOE to the inspection system.

As a feature that can be optionally configured the TOE supports:
   Active Authentication
    which according to [ICAO-9303] prevents copying the SOD and proves that it
    has been read from the authentic chip. It proves that the chip has not been
    substituted.


   Polymorphic Authentication
    which according to [PCA-eMRTD] provides additional privacy by randomisation
    of returned Polymorphic Identities, Polymorphic Pseudonyms and
    Complementary Polymorphic ID attributes in combination`with standard ICAO
    and EAC1 eMRTD protocols specified in ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] and BSI
    TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1] and [TR 03110-3].

The TOE may also be used as an ISO driving license, compliant to ISO/IEC 18013
or ISO/IEC TR 19446 supporting PACE, AA and CA, as both applications (MRTD
and IDL) share the same protocols and data structure organization. Therefore, in
the rest of the document, the word “MRTD” MAY be understood either as a MRTD
in the sense of ICAO, or a driving license compliant to ISO/IEC 18013 or ISO/IEC

This TOE claims an assurance level EAL5 augmented with AVA_VAN.5 and
ALC_DVS.2. AVA_VAN.5 implies that the TOE is resistant to attacks performed by
an attacker possessing "High attack potential".
Not all key sizes specified in this security target have sufficient cryptographic
strength for satisfying the AVA_VAN.5 “high attack potential”. In order to be
protected against attackers with a "high attack potential", sufficiently large
cryptographic key sizes SHALL be configured for this TOE. References can be
found in national and international document standards. Further details have
been specified in the TOE’s guidance documentation [AGD_PRE].

    Polymorphic eMRTD and
    EU/ISO Driving Licence.

The ICAO/EAC eMRTD, Polymorphic eMRTD and Driver Licence are installed as a
separate application instances of the applet having their own dedicated
application identifiers and personalisation. The following TOE configurations are
covered within the scope of this Security Target:

[TR-03110] have also been refered to in ISO18013 for EU driving licences. The
BAP-1 protocol defined in ISO18013 is equal to Basic Access Protocol (BAC)
defined in [ICAO-9303]. As to the logical data structure, the ISO18013 uses the
same concept of Passive Authentication defined in [ICAO-9303], but specifies
different ISO7816-4 elementary file identifiers for storing the ICAO defined
content of DG3, DG4 and DG15.

When an Issuing state is using the product as an ISO compliant Driving licence,
the following name mapping of roles, definitions, data groups and protocol is

use of TOE configured as respectively ICAO/EAC eMRTD/Driving licence and
Polymorphic eMRTD.


1.4.2.1 ICAO/EAC eMRTD and ISO Driving licence
This sub section explains the TOE security features for operational use of TOE
configured as ICAO/EAC eMRTD or as Driving Licence.

A State or Organisation issues travel documents to be used by the holder for
international travel. The traveller presents a travel document to the inspection
system to prove his or her identity. The travel document in context of this
Security Target contains:
  I.  visual (eye readable) biographical data and portrait of the holder,
 II.  a separate data summary (MRZ data) for visual and machine reading using
       OCR methods in the Machine readable zone (MRZ) and
III.  data elements on the travel document’s chip according to LDS in case of
       contactless machine reading.

The authentication of the traveller is based on:
  I.  the possession of a valid travel document personalized for a holder with
      the claimed identity as given on the biographical data page and
 II.  biometrics using the reference data stored in the travel document.

                              eMRTD Configuration)


The issuing State or Organization ensures the authenticity of the data of genuine
travel documents. The receiving State trusts a genuine travel document of an
issuing State or Organization.

For this Security Target the travel document is viewed as unit of:
(i) the physical part of the travel document in form of paper and/or plastic
    and chip. It presents visual readable data including (but not limited to)
    personal data of the travel document holder
    (a) the biographical data on the biographical data page of the travel
         document surface,
    (b) the printed data in the Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) and
    (c) the printed portrait.

(ii) the logical travel document as data of the travel document holder stored
     according to the Logical Data Structure as defined in [ICAO-9303] as specified
     by ICAO on the contact based or contactless integrated circuit. It presents
     contact based / contactless readable data including(but not limited to)
     personal data of the travel document holder
     (a) the digital Machine Readable Zone Data (digital MRZ data, EF.DG1),
     (b) the digitized portraits (EF.DG2),
     (c) the biometric reference data of finger(s) (EF.DG3) or iris image(s)
          (EF.DG4) or both1,
     (d) the other data according to LDS (EF.DG5 to EF.DG16) and
     (e) the Document Security Object (SOD).


The issuing State or Organisation implements security features of the travel
document to maintain the authenticity and integrity of the travel document and
their data. The physical part of the travel document and the travel document’s
chip are identified by the Document Number.

The physical part of the travel document is protected by physical security
measures (e.g. watermark, security printing), logical (e.g. authentication keys of
the travel document’s chip) and organisational security measures (e.g. control of
materials, personalisation procedures) [ICAO-9303].These security measures can
include the binding of the travel document’s chip to the travel document.

The logical travel document is protected in authenticity and integrity by a digital
signature created by the document signer acting for the issuing State or
Organisation and the security features of the travel document’s chip.

The ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] defines the baseline security methods Passive
Authentication, advanced security access methods Basic Access Control (BAC)
and Password Authenticated Connection Establishment to the logical travel



These biometric reference data are optional according to [ICAO-9303]. This ST assumes that the issuing State or
1

Organisation uses this option and protects these data by means of extended access control.

document, Active Authentication of the travel document’s chip, Extended Access
Control and the Data Encryption of sensitive biometrics as optional security
measure. The Passive Authentication Mechanism is performed completely and
independently of the TOE by the TOE environment.

The BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1] and [TR 03110-3] specify the
Extended Access Control protocols Chip Authentication version 1 (CAv1) and
Terminal Authentication (TAv1), which are required to get secured access to the
biometric data stored in data groups DG3 and DG4 in combination with PACE or
BAC.

This Security Target addresses the protection of the logical travel document:
   (i) in integrity by write-only-once access control and by physical means, and
   (ii) in confidentiality by the Extended Access Control Mechanism.

This Security Target addresses the Chip Authentication Version 1 described in
[TR-03110-1] and PACE-CAM described in [ICAO-9303] part 11 as an alternative
to the Active Authentication stated in [ICAO-9303].

For Basic Access Control (BAC) supported by the product, a separate evaluation
and certification is performed with ST [ST-BAC].

The confidentiality by Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
is a mandatory security feature of the TOE. The travel document shall strictly
conform to the ‘Common Criteria Protection Profile Machine Readable Travel
Document using Standard Inspection Procedure with PACE [PACE-PP]. Note that
[PACE-PP] considers high attack potential.

For the PACE protocol according to [ICAO-9303] part 11, the following steps shall
be performed:
 (i) the travel document's chip encrypts a nonce with the shared password,
       derived from the MRZ resp. CAN data and transmits the encrypted nonce
       together with the domain parameters to the terminal.
 (ii) The terminal recovers the nonce using the shared password, by
       (physically) reading the MRZ or CAN data. This nonce shall be converted to
       a group generator using one of the following mapping algorithms, which
       maps a static generator to an ephemeral generator:
           a. Generic mapping (PACE-GM) or
           b. Integrated mapping PACE-IM)
 (iii) The travel document's chip and terminal computer perform a Diffie-
       Hellmann key agreement together with the ephemeral domain parameters
       to create a shared secret. Both parties derive the session keys KMAC and
       KENC from the shared secret.
 (iv) Each party generates an authentication token, sends it to the other party
       and verifies the received token.

In case of PACE with Chip Authenticated Mapping (PACE-CAM), in addition to the
steps above executed for the PACE-GM variant, the MRTD chip computes Chip
Authentication Data CAIC, encrypts them AIC = E(KSEnc, CAIC) and sends them

to the terminal. The terminal decrypts AIC and verifies the authenticity of the
chip using the recovered Chip Authentication Data CAIC.

After successful key negotiation, the terminal and the travel document's chip
provide private communication (secure messaging) [TR-03110-1], [ICAO-9303].

This Security Target requires the TOE to implement the Extended Access Control
as defined in [TR-03110-1]. The Extended Access Control consists of two parts:
  (i) the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1 and
  (ii) the Terminal Authentication Protocol Version 1 (v.1).

The Chip Authentication Protocol v.1
  (i) authenticates the travel document’s chip to the inspection system and
  (ii) establishes secure messaging which is used by Terminal Authentication v.1
       to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the sensitive biometric
       reference data during their transmission from the TOE to the inspection
       system. Therefore Terminal Authentication v.1 can only be performed if
       Chip Authentication v.1has been successfully executed.

The Terminal Authentication Protocolv.1 consists of
  (i) the authentication of the inspection system as entity authorized by the
       receiving State or Organisation through the issuing State, and
  (ii) an access control by the TOE to allow reading the sensitive biometric
       reference data only to successfully authenticated authorized inspection
       systems.

The Active Authentication protocol may be optionally configured during
personalisation.

The issuing State or Organisation authorizes the receiving State by means of
certification the authentication public keys of Document Verifiers who create
Inspection System Certificates.


1.4.2.2 Polymorphic eMRTD

In addition to an ICAO/EAC eMRTD functionality, the TOE supports Polymorphic
eMRTD extensions that can be configured using the same applet during
personalisation. The TOE’s Polymorphic eMRTD extensions enable secure
authentication with enhanced privacy protection features. The Polymorphic
extensions provide the holder the possibility to authenticate towards a service
provider using an authentication service in a non-traceable and non-linkable
manner thanks to usage of Polymorphic ID attributes.

The Polymorphic extensions are used to configure a Polymorphic eMRTD as stand
alone application instance or next to an ICAO/EAC eMRTD/Driving application
licence instance having its own application identifier during personalisation.

                        eMRTD Configuration)

The Polymorphic eMRTD uses the same ICAO and EAC1 protocols like PACEv2,
Chip Authentication v1 (CAv1) and Terminal Authentication (v1) as defined in
[ICAO-9303], [TR-03110-1] and [TR-03110-3]. The TOE’s Polymorphic eMRTD
extensions provide the following features:

      Secure storage of the Polymorphic ID attributes during personalisation or
       the TOE.
      Polymorphic Authentication Protocol (PMA) for authenticated access with
       user consent, randomization and secure readout of the Polymorphic ID
       attributes, in combination with PACEv2 and EAC1 eMRTD protocols.
      PACEv2 protocol extended with PIN and PUK passwords, to enforce user
       authentication (document holder verification) in compliance with [TR-
       03101-3].

For Polymorphic eMRTD, the PACE protocol is configured with PIN, PUK and CAN
passwords in compliance with [TR-03110-3] during personalisation. Only PACE-
GM and PACE-IM are configurable for a Polymorphic eMRTD.

The Active Authentication protocol shall not be configured for a polymorphic
eMRTD.

The logical data structure consists only of EF.CVCA, DG14 and EF.SOD. In order
to assure a sufficient level of privacy during authentication the CAv1 private key
and EF.SOD are shared amoung a sufficient high number of personalised
Polymorphic eMRTDs, i.e. the logical data structure does not contain any unique
identifiable data.



1.4.3 TOE life cycle
The TOE life cycle is described in terms of its four life cycle phases. (With respect
to the [SIC-PP], the TOE life-cycle is additionally subdivided into 7 steps in the
ST. These steps are denoted too in the following although the sequence of the
steps differs for the TOE life cycle).

1.4.3.1 Phase 1 “Development”
(Step1) The TOE is developed in phase 1. The IC developer develops the
integrated circuit, the IC Dedicated Software and the guidance documentation
associated with these TOE components.
The IC developer also acts as the developer of the embedded software (operating
system), which is the NXP JCOP 3 P60.

(Step2) The software developer uses the guidance documentation for the
integrated circuit and the guidance documentation for relevant parts of the NXP
JCOP 3 P60 and develops the ePassport application and the guidance
documentation associated with this TOE component.

The ePassport application (i.e. the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
(SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet run time code) may be
integrated either in ROM or in EEPROM of the chip. Depending on the intention:
      (a) the ePassport application is securely delivered directly from the
          software developer (IDEMIA development dept.) to the IC manufacturer
          (NXP). The applet code will be integrated into the ROM mask code or
          inEEPROM by the IC manufacturer, or
      (b) the ePassport application is securely delivered directly from the
          software developer (IDEMIA development dept.) to the travel document
          manufacturer (IDEMIA production dept.) .) for loading in EEPROM.

Notice that the guidance documentation of the ePassport application is always
securely delivered directly from the software developer (IDEMIA development
dept.) to the travel document manufacturer (IDEMIA production dept.).


1.4.3.2 Phase 2 “Manufacturing”
(Step3) In a first step the TOE integrated circuit is produced containing the travel
document’s chip Dedicated Software, the parts of the travel document’s chip
Embedded Software and in case of alternative a) the ePassport application in
ROM or in EEPROM.

The IC manufacturer writes the IC Identification Data onto the chip to control the
IC as travel document material during the IC manufacturing and the delivery
process to the travel document manufacturer. The IC is securely delivered from
the IC manufacturer to the travel document manufacturer.

                           eMRTD Configuration)

If necessary the IC manufacturer adds the parts of the IC Embedded Software in
the non-volatile programmable memories (for instance EEPROM).

(Step4 optional) The travel document manufacturer combines the IC with
hardware for the contact based / contactless interface in the travel document
unless the travel document consist of the chip only.

(Step5) The travel document manufacturer
  i.  adds the IC Embedded Software or part of it in the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM) if necessary and in case
      of alternative (b), loads the ePassport application into the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM),
 ii.      creates the ePassport application and
iii.      equips travel document’s chips with pre-personalization Data.

EAC PP Application Note 1: Creation of the application for this TOE implies
Applet instantiation.

For this Security Target the following name mappings to the protection profile
[EAC-PP-V2] apply:
    IC Dedicated SW = Low level IC libraries
    travel document’s chip Embedded Software = NXP JCOP 3 P60 operating
       system.
    ePassport application = IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
       (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet run time code or an
       instantiation of it.
    Pre-personalization Data = Personalization Agent Key Set, Card Production
       Life Cycle (CPLC) data and buffer settings.

Both the underlying platform and IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
(SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet provide configuration and
life-cycle management functions required for TOE preparation. TOE preparation
steps are performed in manufacturing phase and consist of the following 2
activities:
    1. Platform initialisation
       2. Pre-personalisation

Platform initialisation
Platform initialisation consists of the configuration of the NXP JCOP 3 P60 in
accordance with requirements specified in the platform administrator guidance
[PLTF-PRE] by using the dedicated platform commands. Furthermore the Pre-
Personalisation Agent key set is installed and (a part of) the CPLC data is
updated. To prevent unattended tracing of the MRTD document, the NXP JCOP 3
P60 is configured such that unauthenticated access to any platform unique
idenfiable data is not possible.

                              eMRTD Configuration)

Pre-personalisation
The pre-personalisation consists of the following steps:
   a. IC (chip) Authentication and getting chip access with the pre-
      personalisation key set.
   b. [optional] In case the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
      (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet runtime code does
      not reside in ROM, it is loaded into EEPROM.
   c. Install the applet application instances depending on the desired TOE
      configuration specified in section 1.4.2, using IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with
      Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet.
   d. Set the ePassport (and if present) the Polymorphic eMRTD applet
      irreversibly in its PERSONALISATION life-cycle state by installation of the
      Personalisation Agent specific personalisation key set(s).

During step (c) the CPLC data with the IC Identifier as well as the other pre-
personalisation data is configured in the TOE. The last step (d) finalizes the TOE.
This is the moment the TOE starts to exist and is ready for delivery to the
Personalisation Agent. The guidance documentation for the Personalisation Agent
is [AGD_PRE].

The pre-personalised travel document together with the IC Identifier is securely
delivered from the travel document manufacturer to the Personalisation Agent.
The travel document manufacturer also provides the relevant parts of the
guidance documentation [AGD_PRE] and [AGD_OPE] and the Personalisation
Agent Key set to the Personalisation Agent. The following table describes the
physical delivery of the TOE components:

1.4.3.3 Phase 3 “Personalisation of the travel document”
(Step 6) The personalisation of the travel document includes
  i.  the survey of the MRTD holder’s biographical data,
 ii.   the enrolment of the MRTD holder biometric reference data (i.e. the
       digitized portraits and the optional biometric reference data),
iii.   the printing of the visual readable data onto the physical MRTD,
iv.    the writing of the TOE User Data and TSF Data into the logical MRTD and
 v.    configuration of the TSF if necessary.

The step (iv) is performed by the Personalisation Agent and includes but is not
limited to the creation of:
  i.   the digital MRZ data (EF.DG1),
 ii.   the digitized portrait (EF.DG2), and
iii.   the Document security object.

The signing of the Document security object by the Document signer [ICAO-
9303] finalizes the personalisation of the genuine travel document for the travel
document holder. The personalised travel document (together with appropriate
guidance (AGD_OPE) for TOE usage if necessary) is handed over to the travel
document holder for operational use.

The personalisation of Polymorphic eMRTD application instance includes:

 i.    establishing the identity of the polymorphic eMRTD document holder,
 ii.   Requesting the required Polymorphic eMRTD ID attributes from the central
       Key Management authority,
iii.   writing Polymorphic ID attributes, Polymorphic LDS data as defined in
       [PCA-eMRTD],
iv.    writing the TSF data (PIN, PUK, CAv1 private key) as defined in [PCA-
       eMRTD],
 v.    signing the Document Security Object defined in
       [ICAO-9303] (in the role of DS).


The signing of the Document security object by the Document signer [ICAO-
9303] finalizes the personalisation of the genuine Polymorphic eMRTD document
for the travel document holder. The personalised Polymorphic eMRTD document
(together with appropriate guidance (AGD_OPE) for TOE usage if necessary) is
handed over to the Polymorphic eMRTD document holder for operational use.

Authentication trust anchor, the effective date and the Chip Authentication
Private Key.

EAC PP Application note 3: This ST distinguishes between the Personalisation
Agent as entity known to the TOE and the Document Signer as entity in the TOE
IT environment signing the Document security object as described in [ICAO-
9303]. This approach allows but does not enforce the separation of these roles.


1.4.3.4 Phase 4 “Operational Use”
(Step 7) The TOE is used as a travel document's chip by the traveller and the
inspection systems in the “Operational Use” phase. The user data can be read
according to the security policy of the issuing State or Organisation and can be
used according to the security policy of the issuing State but they can never be
modified.

EAC PP Application note 42: The intention of the ST is to consider at least the
phases 1 and parts of phase 2 (i.e. Step1 to Step3) as part of the evaluation and
therefore to define the TOE delivery according to CC after this phase. Since
specific production steps of phase 2 are of minor security relevance (e.g. booklet
manufacturing and antenna integration) these are not part of the CC evaluation
under ALC. Nevertheless the decision about this has to be taken by the
certification body resp. the national body of the issuing State or Organisation. In
this case the national body of the issuing State or Organisation is responsible for
these specific production steps.
Note that the personalisation process and its environment may depend on
specific security needs of an issuing State or Organisation. All production,
generation and installation procedures after TOE delivery up to the “Operational
Use” (phase 4) have to be considered in the product evaluation process under
AGD assurance class. Therefore, the Security Target outlines the split up of
P.Manufact, P.Personalisation and the related security objectives into aspects
relevant before vs. after TOE delivery.


1.4.3.5 Non-TOE hardware/software/firmware required by the TOE
There is no explicit non-TOE hardware, software or firmware required by the TOE
to perform its claimed security features. The TOE is defined to comprise the chip
and the complete operating system and application. Note, the inlay holding the
chip as well as the antenna and the booklet (holding the printed MRZ) are
needed to represent a complete travel document. Nevertheless, these parts are
not inevitable for the secure operation of the TOE.




2
 For this ST all steps of both phase 1 and phase 2 are part of the evaluation and therefore define the TOE
delivery according to the CC evaluation after this phase.

2.3 Package Claim
This ST is conforming to assurance package EAL5 augmented with ALC_DVS.2
and AVA_VAN.5 defined in CC part 3 [CC-3].


2.4 PP Conformance Rationale
This ST claims strict conformance to [EAC-PP-V2]. According to hints in [EAC-PP-
V2] parts of the [PACE-PP] have been included into this ST. A detailed
justification is given in the following.


2.4.1 Main aspects
-   The TOE description (chapter 1.3) is based on the TOE definition and TOE
    usage of [EAC-PP, 1.1]. It was enhanced by product specific details.

-   All definitions of the security problem definition in [EAC-PP, 3] have been
    taken exactly from the protection profile in the same wording.

-   All security objectives have been taken exactly from [EAC-PP, 4] in the same
    wording, except for OT.Chip_Auth_Proof which is enhanced to support
    Active Authentication.

-   The part of extended components definition has been taken originally from
    [EAC-PP, 5].

-   All SFRs for the TOE have been taken originally from the [EAC-PP, 6.1] added
    by according iterations, selections and assignments.

-   The security assurance requirements (SARs) have been taken originally from
    the EAC-PP. The requirements are shifted to those of EAL 5+.


2.4.2 Overview of differences between the PP and the ST

The Active Authentication has been added to the TOE. For that:
- One assumption has been added to cover Active Authentication during
   personalization: A.Pers_Agent_AA
- Two security objectives for the environment have been added:
   OE.Auth_Key_MRTD and OE.AA_MRTD. These additions to the original
   objectives of the PP do not contradict with any other objective nor mitigate a
   threat (or part of a threat) meant to be addressed by security objectives for
   the TOE in the PP.
- Three security functional requirements have been added:
              FCS_COP.1/SIG_GEN
                FIA_API.1/AA
                FMT_MTD.1/AAPK

                  IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy
                                                                2018_2000036361

                        eMRTD Configuration)

The additional functionality of Password Authenticated Connection Establishment
with Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM) has been added to the TOE. It
possesses the same security requirements as the PACE functionality, which
means that the same security problem definition is applicable for PACE-CAM.


The following additional SFRs have been defined for PACE-CAM:
              FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM
                FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM
                FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM
                FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM
                FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM
                FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ
                FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_WRITE




The additional functionality of the Polymorphic eMRTD extensions has been
added to the TOE with: (i) additional security problem definition; (ii) additional
security objectives; (iii) additional SFRs. Notice that many SFRs are included
from the [EACv2-PP].

                           eneral support for cryptographic operations needed.

OT.Data_Authenticity The security objective OT.Data_Authenticity aims
  ensuring authenticity of the User- and TSF data (after the PACE
  Authentication) by enabling its verification at the terminal-side and by an
  active verification by the TOE itself. This objective is mainly achieved by
  FTP_ITC.1/PACE using FCS_COP.1/PACE_MAC. A prerequisite for establishing
  this trusted channel is a successful PACE or Chip and Terminal Authentication
  v.1       FIA_UID.1/PACE,       FIA_UAU.1/PACE        (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM,
  FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) using FCS_CKM.1/DH_PACE resp.
  FCS_CKM.1/CA and possessing the special properties FIA_UAU.5/PACE,
  FIA_UAU.6/PACE (FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM, FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM for PACE
  CAM) resp. FIA_UAU.6/EAC. FDP_RIP.1 requires erasing the values of session
  keys (here: for KMAC). FIA_UAU.4/PACE, FIA_UAU.5/PACE and FCS_CKM.4
  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM, FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM and FCS_CKM.4 for PACE
  CAM) represent some required specific properties of the protocols used. The
  SFR FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords, the
  Chip Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication Private Key. The
  SFR FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE
  passwords and the modular invert of the CA key. FMT_MTD.1/PA requires that
  SOD containing signature over the User Data stored on the TOE and used for
  the Passive Authentication is allowed to be written by the Personalisation
  Agent only and, hence, is to be considered as trustworthy. The SFR
  FCS_RND.1 represents a general support for cryptographic operations needed.
  The SFRs FMT_SMF.1 and FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles
  related.

OT.Data_Confidentiality The security objective OT.Data_Confidentiality aims
  that the TOE always ensures confidentiality of the User- and TSF-data stored
  and, after the PACE Authentication resp. Chip Authentication, of these data
  exchanged. This objective for the data stored is mainly achieved by
                        Security Target Lite
                                                                   Ref.:

  (FDP_ACC.1/TRM, FDP_ACF.1/TRM). FIA_UAU.4/PACE, FIA_UAU.5/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM,        FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM      for   PACE    CAM)    and
  FCS_CKM.4 represent some required specific properties of the protocols used.
  This objective for the data exchanged is mainly achieved by FDP_UCT.1/TRM,
  FDP_UIT.1/TRM and FTP_ITC.1/PACE using FCS_COP.1/PACE_ENC resp.
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC. A prerequisite for establishing this trusted channel is a
  successful PACE or Chip and Terminal Authentication v.1 FIA_UID.1/PACE,
  FIA_UAU.1/PACE (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM, FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE
  CAM) using FCS_CKM.1/DH_PACE resp. FCS_CKM.1/CA and possessing the
  special properties FIA_UAU.5/PACE, FIA_UAU.6/PACE (FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM,
  FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) resp. FIA_UAU.6/EAC. FDP_RIP.1
  requires erasing the values of session keys (here: for Kenc). The SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords, the Chip
  Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication Private Key. The SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords
  and the modular invert of the CA key. FMT_MTD.1/PA requires that SOD
  containing signature over the User Data stored on the TOE and used for the
  Passive Authentication is allowed to be written by the Personalisation Agent
  only and, hence, is to be considered trustworthy. The SFR FCS_RND.1
  represents the general support for cryptographic operations needed. The SFRs
  FMT_SMF.1 and FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related.

OT.Tracing The security objective OT.Tracing aims that the TOE prevents
  gathering TOE tracing data by means of unambiguous identifying the travel
  document remotely through establishing or listening to a communication via
  the contactless/contact-based interface of the TOE without a priori knowledge
  of the correct values of shared passwords (CAN, MRZ, PIN, PUK). This
  objective is achieved as follows:
            1. While establishing PACE communication with CAN, MRZ or PUK
                (non-blocking      authentication /   authorization  data)   by
                FIA_AFL.1/PACE,
            2. while establishing PACE communication using the PIN (blocking
                authentication data) by FIA_AFL.1/Block_PIN,
            3. for listening to PACE communication and for establishing CAv1
                communication by FTP_ITC.1/PACE,
            4. and      for     listening     to  CAv1     communication     by
                FTP_ITC.1/Polymorphic. The trusted channel shall be established
                by performing the PACE, CAv1 and TAv1 protocols according to
                [TR03110TR-03110] and the Polymorphic Authentication protocol
                (PMA).

OT.Prot_Abuse-Func The security objective OT.Prot_Abuse-Func “Protection
  against Abuse of Functionality” is ensured by the SFRs FMT_LIM.1, FMT_LIM.2,
  FMT_LIM.1/POLY and FMT_LIM.2/POLY which prevent misuse of test
  functionality of the TOE or other features which may not be used after TOE
  Delivery.

OT.Prot_Inf_Leak The security objective OT.Prot_Inf_Leak “Protection against
  Information Leakage” requires the TOE to protect confidential TSF data stored
  and/or processed in the travel document’s chip against disclosure
      by measurement and analysis of the shape and amplitude of signals or the
        time between events found by measuring signals on the electromagnetic
        field, power consumption, clock, or I/O lines which is addressed by the
        SFR FPT_EMS.1,
      by forcing a malfunction of the TOE which is addressed by the SFR
        FPT_FLS.1 and FPT_TST.1, and/or
      by a physical manipulation of the TOE which is addressed by the SFR
        FPT_PHP.3.

OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper The security objective OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper “Protection
  against Physical Tampering” is covered by the SFR FPT_PHP.3.

OT.Prot_Malfunction The security objective OT.Prot_Malfunction “Protection
  against Malfunctions” is covered by (i) the SFR FPT_TST.1 which requires self-
  tests to demonstrate the correct operation and tests of authorized users to
  verify the integrity of TSF data and TSF code, and (ii) the SFRFPT_FLS.1 which
  requires a secure state in case of detected failure or operating conditions
  possibly causing a malfunction.

OT.Identification The security objective OT.Identification “Identification of the
  TOE” addresses the storage of Initialisation and Pre-Personalisation Data in its
  non-volatile memory, whereby they also include the IC Identification Data
  uniquely identifying the TOE’s chip. This will be ensured by TSF according to
  SFR FAU_SAS.1. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA allows only the Manufacturer
  to write Initialisation and Pre-personalisation Data (including the
  Personalisation Agent key set). The SFR FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS requires the
  Personalisation Agent to disable access to Initialisation and Pre-personalisation
  Data in the life cycle phase ‘operational use’. The SFRs FMT_SMF.1 and
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related.

OT.AC_Pers The       security   objective  OT.AC_Pers      “Access   Control   for
  Personalisation of logical travel document” addresses the access control of the
  writing the logical travel document. The justification for the SFRs FAU_SAS.1,
  FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA and FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS arises from the justification for
  OT.Identification above with respect to the Pre-personalisation Data. The write
  access to the logical travel document data are defined by the SFR
  FIA_UID.1/PACE (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM), FIA_UAU.1/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM), FDP_ACC.1/TRM and FDP_ACF.1/TRM
  in the same way: only the successfully authenticated Personalisation Agent is
  allowed to write the data of the groups EF.DG1 to EF.DG16 of the logical travel
  document only once. FMT_MTD.1/PA covers the related property of
  OT.AC_Pers (writing SOD and, in generally, personalization data). The SFR
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE lists the roles (including Personalisation Agent) and the SFR
  FMT_SMF.1 lists the TSF management functions (including Personalisation).

  The SFRs FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ (FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ for
  PACE CAM protocol) and FPT_EMS.1 restrict the access to the Personalisation
  Agent Keys, the Chip Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication
  Private key. The authentication of the terminal as Personalisation Agent shall
  be performed by TSF according to SFRs FIA_UAU.4/PACE and FIA_UAU.5/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM and FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). If the
  Personalisation Terminal wants to authenticate itself to the TOE by means of
  the Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 (after Chip Authentication v.1) with
  the Personalisation Agent Keys, the TOE will use TSF according to the
  FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the challenge), FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the
  derivation of the new session keys after Chip Authentication v.1), and
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC (for the ENC_MAC_Mode secure
  messaging), FCS_COP.1/SIG_VER (as part of the Terminal Authentication
  Protocol v.1) and FIA_UAU.6/EAC (for the re-authentication). If the
  Personalisation Terminal wants to authenticate itself to the TOE by means of
  the Authentication Mechanism with the Personalisation Agent Key, the TOE will
  use TSF according to the FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the challenge) and
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC (to verify the authentication attempt). The session keys
  are destroyed according to FCS_CKM.4 after use.

OT.Sens_Data_Conf The            security     objective      OT.Sense_Data_Conf“
  Confidentiality of sensitive biometric reference data” is enforced by the Access
  Control SFP defined in FDP_ACC.1/TRM and FDP_ACF.1/TRM allowing the data
  of EF.DG3 and EF.DG4 only to be read by successfully authenticated Extended
  Inspection System being authorized by a valid certificate according
  FCS_COP.1/SIG_VER. The SFRs FIA_UID.1/PACE and FIA_UAU.1/PACE
  (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM and FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) require the
  identification and authentication of the inspection systems. The SFR
  FIA_UAU.5/PACE requires the successful Chip Authentication (CA) v.1 before
  any     authentication    attempt   as    Extended     Inspection  System    (or
  FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). During the protected communication
  following the CA v.1 the reuse of authentication data is prevented by
  FIA_UAU.4/PACE (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). The SFR
  FIA_UAU.6/EAC and FDP_UCT.1/TRM requires the confidentiality protection of
  the transmitted data after Chip Authentication v.1 by means of secure
  messaging implemented by the cryptographic functions according to
  FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the terminal authentication challenge),
  FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the generation of shared secret and for the derivation of
  the new session keys), and FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC for
  the ENC_MAC_Mode secure messaging. The session keys are destroyed
  according to FCS_CKM.4 after use. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/CAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ requires that the Chip Authentication Key cannot be
  written unauthorized or read afterwards. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/AAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ requires that the Active Authentication Key cannot be
  written       unauthorized       or      read      afterwards.      The     SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_WRITE and FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ
  requires that the modular invert of the CA key cannot be written unauthorized
  or read afterwards. To allow a verification of the certificate chain as in

OT.Chip_Auth_Proof The security objective OT.Chip_Auth_Proof “Proof of
  travel document’s chip authenticity” is ensured by the Chip Authentication
  Protocolv.1 provided by FIA_API.1/CA and by Active Authentication provided
  by FIA_API.1/AA proving the identity of the TOE. The Chip Authentication
  Protocolv.1 defined by FCS_CKM.1/CA is performed using a TOE internally
  stored confidential private key as required by FMT_MTD.1/CAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ. The Chip Authentication Protocolv.1 [TR-03110-1]
  requires additional TSF according to FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the derivation of the
  session keys), FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC (for the
  ENC_MAC_Mode        secure    messaging).    The   SFRs     FMT_SMF.1     and
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related. The Active
  Authentication defined by FCS_COP.1/SIG_GEN for the generation of the RSA
  Signature is performed using a TOE internally stored confidential private key
  as required by FMT_MTD.1/AAPK and FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ. According to
  FDP_ACF.1, only the successfully authenticated Inspection Systems are
  allowed to request active authentication (FDP_ACF.1.2, rule 2).

6.3.3.1.1 Rationale for the exclusion of Dependencies


The dependency FMT_MSA.3 of FDP_ACF.1/TRM is discarded. The access
  control TSF according to FDP_ACF.1/TRM uses security attributes which are
  defined during the personalisation and are fixed over the whole life time of the
  TOE. No management of these security attribute (i.e. SFR FMT_MSA.1 and
  FMT_MSA.3) is necessary here.

6.3.4 Rationale for the Security Assurance Requirements
The EAL5 was chosen to permits a developer to gain maximum assurance from
positive security engineering based upon rigorous commercial development
practices supported by moderate application of specialist security engineering
techniques. Such a TOE will probably be designed and developed with the intent
of achieving EAL5 assurance. It is likely that the additional costs attributable to
the EAL5 requirements, relative to rigorous development without the application
of specialised techniques, will not be large.

7 TOE Summary Specification

7.1 TOE Summary Specification
This section provides a description of the security functions and assurance
measures of the TOE that meet the TOE security requirements.

The TOE provides security features (SF) which can be associated to following
groups:
  Identification and Authentication mechanisms
  Cryptographic functions support
  Access control /Storage and protection of logical travel document data
  Secure messaging
  Security and Life-cycle management
Moreover, the TOE will protect itself against interference, logical tampering and
bypass. The security functionality of the TOE respectively the IDeal Pass v2.3-n
JC with Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet
will be externally available to the user by APDU commands according to the
access conditions specified by the according policies considering the life cycle
state, user role and security state.

7.1.1 SF.IA Identification and Authentication
The different authentication mechanisms are supported by APDU commands and
parameters using the cryptographic functions provided by the platform. The
authentication mechanisms are enforced by protocols and APDU methods as
specified in the functional specification.

Note that Symmetric Basic Access Control (BAC) Authentication Mechanism is
supported by the TOE but not covered by this Security Target.

The TOE supports the following authentication mechanisms:
        SF.IA.1: Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
        SF.IA.2: EAC Chip Authentication v. 1
        SF.IA.3: EAC Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1
        SF.IA.4: Authentication of the Personalization Agent with a
         personalisation key set based on a symmetric authentication
         mechanism
        SF.IA.5: ICAO Active Authentication
        SF.IA.6: Optionally PACE with additional Chip Authentication Mapping
         (PACE CAM)
        SF.IA.7: Polymorphic Authentication (PMA)
        SF.IA.8: Polymorphic eMRTD Document Holder Verification

        steps (i.e. during sequence of PACE with PIN, PA, CAv1, TAv1 and
        PMA).
     o The authorized Polymorphic Authentication Service/Terminal has to
        ensure that the randomised PP, PI and optional CPI are securely
        received and transformed by the central Key Management Authority.
        This comprises:
         eMRTD       document      authentication   by   performing   Passive
            Authentication (SOD and DG14) signature verification and Chip
            Authentication (CAv1), being part of the Polymorphic Authentication
            process steps (i.e. sequence of PACE with PIN, PA, CAv1, TAv1 and
            PMA).
         eMRTD document status validation by encryption of the randomized
            PP received from the TOE using the public key of the eMRTD
            document Status Service and sending this with the the
            coresponding meta-data obtained from the TOE to the eMRTD
            document Status Service.

  Application Note:
  This OE has been added to this ST for the polymorphic authentication
  infrastructure. This addition does not conflict with the strict conformance to
  PACE PP [PACE-PP] and EACv1 PP [EAC-PP-V2].

OE.Authoriz_Polymorphic_Data
  Authorization for Use of Polymorphic eMRTD User Data
     o The issuing States or Organisations have to establish a dedicated
       (separated) CVCA, DVCA and IS PKI in the polymorphic eMRTD
       infrastructure.
     o The Country Verifying Certification Authorities, the Document Verifier
       and Inspection Systems have to hold authentication key pairs and
       certificates for their public keys encoding the access control rights. The
       Country Verifying Certification Authorities of the issuing States or
       Organisations have to sign the certificates of the Document Verifier and
       the Document Verifiers have to sign the certificates of the Inspection
       Systems. The issuing States or Organisations have to distribute the
       public keys of their Country Verifying Certification Authority to their
       Polymorphic eMRTD document's chip.
     o The issuing State or Organisation have to establish the necessary public
       key infrastructure in order to limit the access to Polymorphic data of
       Polymorphic eMRTD document holders to authorized Organisations. The
       Country Verifying Certification Authority of the issuing State or

    the EAC-PP. The requirements are shifted to those of EAL 5+.


2.4.2 Overview of differences between the PP and the ST

The Active Authentication has been added to the TOE. For that:
- One assumption has been added to cover Active Authentication during
   personalization: A.Pers_Agent_AA
- Two security objectives for the environment have been added:
   OE.Auth_Key_MRTD and OE.AA_MRTD. These additions to the original
   objectives of the PP do not contradict with any other objective nor mitigate a
   threat (or part of a threat) meant to be addressed by security objectives for
   the TOE in the PP.
- Three security functional requirements have been added:
              FCS_COP.1/SIG_GEN
                FIA_API.1/AA
                FMT_MTD.1/AAPK

                        eMRTD Configuration)

The additional functionality of Password Authenticated Connection Establishment
with Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM) has been added to the TOE. It
possesses the same security requirements as the PACE functionality, which
means that the same security problem definition is applicable for PACE-CAM.


The following additional SFRs have been defined for PACE-CAM:
              FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM
                FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM
                FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM
                FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM
                FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM
                FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ
                FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_WRITE




The additional functionality of the Polymorphic eMRTD extensions has been
added to the TOE with: (i) additional security problem definition; (ii) additional
security objectives; (iii) additional SFRs. Notice that many SFRs are included
from the [EACv2-PP].

                           eneral support for cryptographic operations needed.

OT.Data_Authenticity The security objective OT.Data_Authenticity aims
  ensuring authenticity of the User- and TSF data (after the PACE
  Authentication) by enabling its verification at the terminal-side and by an
  active verification by the TOE itself. This objective is mainly achieved by
  FTP_ITC.1/PACE using FCS_COP.1/PACE_MAC. A prerequisite for establishing
  this trusted channel is a successful PACE or Chip and Terminal Authentication
  v.1       FIA_UID.1/PACE,       FIA_UAU.1/PACE        (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM,
  FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) using FCS_CKM.1/DH_PACE resp.
  FCS_CKM.1/CA and possessing the special properties FIA_UAU.5/PACE,
  FIA_UAU.6/PACE (FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM, FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM for PACE
  CAM) resp. FIA_UAU.6/EAC. FDP_RIP.1 requires erasing the values of session
  keys (here: for KMAC). FIA_UAU.4/PACE, FIA_UAU.5/PACE and FCS_CKM.4
  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM, FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM and FCS_CKM.4 for PACE
  CAM) represent some required specific properties of the protocols used. The
  SFR FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords, the
  Chip Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication Private Key. The
  SFR FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE
  passwords and the modular invert of the CA key. FMT_MTD.1/PA requires that
  SOD containing signature over the User Data stored on the TOE and used for
  the Passive Authentication is allowed to be written by the Personalisation
  Agent only and, hence, is to be considered as trustworthy. The SFR
  FCS_RND.1 represents a general support for cryptographic operations needed.
  The SFRs FMT_SMF.1 and FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles
  related.

OT.Data_Confidentiality The security objective OT.Data_Confidentiality aims
  that the TOE always ensures confidentiality of the User- and TSF-data stored
  and, after the PACE Authentication resp. Chip Authentication, of these data
  exchanged. This objective for the data stored is mainly achieved by

  (FDP_ACC.1/TRM, FDP_ACF.1/TRM). FIA_UAU.4/PACE, FIA_UAU.5/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM,        FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM      for   PACE    CAM)    and
  FCS_CKM.4 represent some required specific properties of the protocols used.
  This objective for the data exchanged is mainly achieved by FDP_UCT.1/TRM,
  FDP_UIT.1/TRM and FTP_ITC.1/PACE using FCS_COP.1/PACE_ENC resp.
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC. A prerequisite for establishing this trusted channel is a
  successful PACE or Chip and Terminal Authentication v.1 FIA_UID.1/PACE,
  FIA_UAU.1/PACE (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM, FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE
  CAM) using FCS_CKM.1/DH_PACE resp. FCS_CKM.1/CA and possessing the
  special properties FIA_UAU.5/PACE, FIA_UAU.6/PACE (FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM,
  FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) resp. FIA_UAU.6/EAC. FDP_RIP.1
  requires erasing the values of session keys (here: for Kenc). The SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords, the Chip
  Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication Private Key. The SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords
  and the modular invert of the CA key. FMT_MTD.1/PA requires that SOD
  containing signature over the User Data stored on the TOE and used for the
  Passive Authentication is allowed to be written by the Personalisation Agent
  only and, hence, is to be considered trustworthy. The SFR FCS_RND.1
  represents the general support for cryptographic operations needed. The SFRs
  FMT_SMF.1 and FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related.

OT.Tracing The security objective OT.Tracing aims that the TOE prevents
  gathering TOE tracing data by means of unambiguous identifying the travel
  document remotely through establishing or listening to a communication via
  the contactless/contact-based interface of the TOE without a priori knowledge
  of the correct values of shared passwords (CAN, MRZ, PIN, PUK). This
  objective is achieved as follows:
            1. While establishing PACE communication with CAN, MRZ or PUK
                (non-blocking      authentication /   authorization  data)   by
                FIA_AFL.1/PACE,
            2. while establishing PACE communication using the PIN (blocking
                authentication data) by FIA_AFL.1/Block_PIN,
            3. for listening to PACE communication and for establishing CAv1
                communication by FTP_ITC.1/PACE,
            4. and      for     listening     to  CAv1     communication     by
                FTP_ITC.1/Polymorphic. The trusted channel shall be established
                by performing the PACE, CAv1 and TAv1 protocols according to
                [TR03110TR-03110] and the Polymorphic Authentication protocol
                (PMA).

OT.Prot_Abuse-Func The security objective OT.Prot_Abuse-Func “Protection
  against Abuse of Functionality” is ensured by the SFRs FMT_LIM.1, FMT_LIM.2,
  FMT_LIM.1/POLY and FMT_LIM.2/POLY which prevent misuse of test
  functionality of the TOE or other features which may not be used after TOE
  Delivery.

OT.Prot_Inf_Leak The security objective OT.Prot_Inf_Leak “Protection against
  Information Leakage” requires the TOE to protect confidential TSF data stored
  and/or processed in the travel document’s chip against disclosure
      by measurement and analysis of the shape and amplitude of signals or the
        time between events found by measuring signals on the electromagnetic
        field, power consumption, clock, or I/O lines which is addressed by the
        SFR FPT_EMS.1,
      by forcing a malfunction of the TOE which is addressed by the SFR
        FPT_FLS.1 and FPT_TST.1, and/or
      by a physical manipulation of the TOE which is addressed by the SFR
        FPT_PHP.3.

OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper The security objective OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper “Protection
  against Physical Tampering” is covered by the SFR FPT_PHP.3.

OT.Prot_Malfunction The security objective OT.Prot_Malfunction “Protection
  against Malfunctions” is covered by (i) the SFR FPT_TST.1 which requires self-
  tests to demonstrate the correct operation and tests of authorized users to
  verify the integrity of TSF data and TSF code, and (ii) the SFRFPT_FLS.1 which
  requires a secure state in case of detected failure or operating conditions
  possibly causing a malfunction.

OT.Identification The security objective OT.Identification “Identification of the
  TOE” addresses the storage of Initialisation and Pre-Personalisation Data in its
  non-volatile memory, whereby they also include the IC Identification Data
  uniquely identifying the TOE’s chip. This will be ensured by TSF according to
  SFR FAU_SAS.1. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA allows only the Manufacturer
  to write Initialisation and Pre-personalisation Data (including the
  Personalisation Agent key set). The SFR FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS requires the
  Personalisation Agent to disable access to Initialisation and Pre-personalisation
  Data in the life cycle phase ‘operational use’. The SFRs FMT_SMF.1 and
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related.

OT.AC_Pers The       security   objective  OT.AC_Pers      “Access   Control   for
  Personalisation of logical travel document” addresses the access control of the
  writing the logical travel document. The justification for the SFRs FAU_SAS.1,
  FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA and FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS arises from the justification for
  OT.Identification above with respect to the Pre-personalisation Data. The write
  access to the logical travel document data are defined by the SFR
  FIA_UID.1/PACE (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM), FIA_UAU.1/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM), FDP_ACC.1/TRM and FDP_ACF.1/TRM
  in the same way: only the successfully authenticated Personalisation Agent is
  allowed to write the data of the groups EF.DG1 to EF.DG16 of the logical travel
  document only once. FMT_MTD.1/PA covers the related property of
  OT.AC_Pers (writing SOD and, in generally, personalization data). The SFR
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE lists the roles (including Personalisation Agent) and the SFR
  FMT_SMF.1 lists the TSF management functions (including Personalisation).

  The SFRs FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ (FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ for
  PACE CAM protocol) and FPT_EMS.1 restrict the access to the Personalisation
  Agent Keys, the Chip Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication
  Private key. The authentication of the terminal as Personalisation Agent shall
  be performed by TSF according to SFRs FIA_UAU.4/PACE and FIA_UAU.5/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM and FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). If the
  Personalisation Terminal wants to authenticate itself to the TOE by means of
  the Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 (after Chip Authentication v.1) with
  the Personalisation Agent Keys, the TOE will use TSF according to the
  FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the challenge), FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the
  derivation of the new session keys after Chip Authentication v.1), and
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC (for the ENC_MAC_Mode secure
  messaging), FCS_COP.1/SIG_VER (as part of the Terminal Authentication
  Protocol v.1) and FIA_UAU.6/EAC (for the re-authentication). If the
  Personalisation Terminal wants to authenticate itself to the TOE by means of
  the Authentication Mechanism with the Personalisation Agent Key, the TOE will
  use TSF according to the FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the challenge) and
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC (to verify the authentication attempt). The session keys
  are destroyed according to FCS_CKM.4 after use.

OT.Sens_Data_Conf The            security     objective      OT.Sense_Data_Conf“
  Confidentiality of sensitive biometric reference data” is enforced by the Access
  Control SFP defined in FDP_ACC.1/TRM and FDP_ACF.1/TRM allowing the data
  of EF.DG3 and EF.DG4 only to be read by successfully authenticated Extended
  Inspection System being authorized by a valid certificate according
  FCS_COP.1/SIG_VER. The SFRs FIA_UID.1/PACE and FIA_UAU.1/PACE
  (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM and FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) require the
  identification and authentication of the inspection systems. The SFR
  FIA_UAU.5/PACE requires the successful Chip Authentication (CA) v.1 before
  any     authentication    attempt   as    Extended     Inspection  System    (or
  FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). During the protected communication
  following the CA v.1 the reuse of authentication data is prevented by
  FIA_UAU.4/PACE (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). The SFR
  FIA_UAU.6/EAC and FDP_UCT.1/TRM requires the confidentiality protection of
  the transmitted data after Chip Authentication v.1 by means of secure
  messaging implemented by the cryptographic functions according to
  FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the terminal authentication challenge),
  FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the generation of shared secret and for the derivation of
  the new session keys), and FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC for
  the ENC_MAC_Mode secure messaging. The session keys are destroyed
  according to FCS_CKM.4 after use. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/CAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ requires that the Chip Authentication Key cannot be
  written unauthorized or read afterwards. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/AAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ requires that the Active Authentication Key cannot be
  written       unauthorized       or      read      afterwards.      The     SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_WRITE and FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ
  requires that the modular invert of the CA key cannot be written unauthorized
  or read afterwards. To allow a verification of the certificate chain as in

OT.Chip_Auth_Proof The security objective OT.Chip_Auth_Proof “Proof of
  travel document’s chip authenticity” is ensured by the Chip Authentication
  Protocolv.1 provided by FIA_API.1/CA and by Active Authentication provided
  by FIA_API.1/AA proving the identity of the TOE. The Chip Authentication
  Protocolv.1 defined by FCS_CKM.1/CA is performed using a TOE internally
  stored confidential private key as required by FMT_MTD.1/CAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ. The Chip Authentication Protocolv.1 [TR-03110-1]
  requires additional TSF according to FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the derivation of the
  session keys), FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC (for the
  ENC_MAC_Mode        secure    messaging).    The   SFRs     FMT_SMF.1     and
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related. The Active
  Authentication defined by FCS_COP.1/SIG_GEN for the generation of the RSA
  Signature is performed using a TOE internally stored confidential private key
  as required by FMT_MTD.1/AAPK and FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ. According to
  FDP_ACF.1, only the successfully authenticated Inspection Systems are
  allowed to request active authentication (FDP_ACF.1.2, rule 2).

6.3.3.1.1 Rationale for the exclusion of Dependencies


The dependency FMT_MSA.3 of FDP_ACF.1/TRM is discarded. The access
  control TSF according to FDP_ACF.1/TRM uses security attributes which are
  defined during the personalisation and are fixed over the whole life time of the
  TOE. No management of these security attribute (i.e. SFR FMT_MSA.1 and
  FMT_MSA.3) is necessary here.

6.3.4 Rationale for the Security Assurance Requirements
The EAL5 was chosen to permits a developer to gain maximum assurance from
positive security engineering based upon rigorous commercial development
practices supported by moderate application of specialist security engineering
techniques. Such a TOE will probably be designed and developed with the intent
of achieving EAL5 assurance. It is likely that the additional costs attributable to
the EAL5 requirements, relative to rigorous development without the application
of specialised techniques, will not be large.

7 TOE Summary Specification

7.1 TOE Summary Specification
This section provides a description of the security functions and assurance
measures of the TOE that meet the TOE security requirements.

The TOE provides security features (SF) which can be associated to following
groups:
  Identification and Authentication mechanisms
  Cryptographic functions support
  Access control /Storage and protection of logical travel document data
  Secure messaging
  Security and Life-cycle management
Moreover, the TOE will protect itself against interference, logical tampering and
bypass. The security functionality of the TOE respectively the IDeal Pass v2.3-n
JC with Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet
will be externally available to the user by APDU commands according to the
access conditions specified by the according policies considering the life cycle
state, user role and security state.

7.1.1 SF.IA Identification and Authentication
The different authentication mechanisms are supported by APDU commands and
parameters using the cryptographic functions provided by the platform. The
authentication mechanisms are enforced by protocols and APDU methods as
specified in the functional specification.

Note that Symmetric Basic Access Control (BAC) Authentication Mechanism is
supported by the TOE but not covered by this Security Target.

The TOE supports the following authentication mechanisms:
        SF.IA.1: Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
        SF.IA.2: EAC Chip Authentication v. 1
        SF.IA.3: EAC Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1
        SF.IA.4: Authentication of the Personalization Agent with a
         personalisation key set based on a symmetric authentication
         mechanism
        SF.IA.5: ICAO Active Authentication
        SF.IA.6: Optionally PACE with additional Chip Authentication Mapping
         (PACE CAM)
        SF.IA.7: Polymorphic Authentication (PMA)
        SF.IA.8: Polymorphic eMRTD Document Holder Verification

OE.Polymorphic_Auth
     o All authentication infrastructure keys used by the central Key
        Management       Authority    for   the    polymorphic   authentication
        infrastructure (generation and transformation of PP, PI and CPI) are
        generated, handled and stored securely.
     o The Issuer has to ensure that Polymorphic PP/PI/CPI user data is
        generated securely by the central Key Management Authority of the
        polymorphic authentication infrastructure and stored securely in the
        electronic document during the eMRTD personalization phase.
     o The TOE communicates only with a Trustworthy Authentication
        Service/Terminal during the Polymorphic eMRTD authentication process
        steps (i.e. during sequence of PACE with PIN, PA, CAv1, TAv1 and
        PMA).
     o The authorized Polymorphic Authentication Service/Terminal has to
        ensure that the randomised PP, PI and optional CPI are securely
        received and transformed by the central Key Management Authority.
        This comprises:
         eMRTD       document      authentication   by   performing   Passive
            Authentication (SOD and DG14) signature verification and Chip
            Authentication (CAv1), being part of the Polymorphic Authentication
            process steps (i.e. sequence of PACE with PIN, PA, CAv1, TAv1 and
            PMA).
         eMRTD document status validation by encryption of the randomized
            PP received from the TOE using the public key of the eMRTD
            document Status Service and sending this with the the
            coresponding meta-data obtained from the TOE to the eMRTD
            document Status Service.

     o The issuing State or Organisation have to establish the necessary public
       key infrastructure in order to limit the access to Polymorphic data of
       Polymorphic eMRTD document holders to authorized Organisations. The
       Country Verifying Certification Authority of the issuing State or
       Organisation has to generate card verifiable Document Verifier
       Certificates for the authorized Document Verifier only.
     o The issuing State or Organisation has to establish the necessary public
       key infrastructure in order to (i) generate the Polymorphic eMRTD
       document's Chip Authentication Key Pair, (ii) sign and store the Chip
       Authentication Public Key in the Chip Authentication Public Key data
       and (iii) support inspection systems to verify the authenticity of the
       Polymorphic eMRTD document's chip according to [TR-03110] and
       [ICAO-9303] used for genuine Polymorphic eMRTD document by
       certification of the Chip Authentication Public Key by means of the
       Document Security Object (SOD).
     o The Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer shall establish a public key
       infrastructure for the card verifiable certificates used for Terminal
       Authentication. For this aim, the Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer
       shall run a Country Verifying Certification Authority. The PKI shall fulfill
       the requirements and rules of the corresponding certificate policy. The
       Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer shall make the CVCA certificate
       available to the personalization agent or the manufacturer.

OE.Insp_Sys_Polymorphic
  Polymorphic Inspection Systems and authentication services
      o Polymorphic inspection systems (Terminals) or authentication services
         must ensure the confidentiality, privacy, authenticity and integrity of
         the user cerdentials (PIN, PUK, CAN) and the polymorphic data read
         from the polymorphic eMRTD document (integrity of trusted certificate
         store with PKI CSCA and CVCA, DVCA certificates, randomized PI, PP
         and optional CPI polymorphic user data, etc.), where it is necessary for
         a secure operation of the TOE.
      o The inspection system (Terminal/Authentication service) must prevent
         eavesdropping to their communication with the TOE before secure
         messaging is successfully established based on the Chip Authentication
         Protocol Version 1.
      o Inspection Systems that intent to be Polymorphic Authentication
         Terminals/Services must include the Country Signing CA Public Key and
         must implement the respective terminal part of the protocols required
         to execute the Passive Authentication, PACE with PIN, CAv1 and TAv1
         according to [TR-03110] and the Polymorphic Authentication protocol
         (PMA), and store (static keys) or generate (temporary keys and
         nonces) the corresponding credentials.
      o The Document Verifier must authorize Polymorphic Inspection Systems
         by creation of Inspection System Certificates for access to polymorphic
         data of the polymorphic eMRTD document. Polymorphic inspection
         systems must authenticate themselves to the polymorphic eMRTD
         document's chip for access to the polymorphic data with its private
         Terminal Authentication Key and its Inspection System Certificate.

4.3 Security Objectives Rationale

4.3.1 Threats

4.3.1.1 Threats listed in PP PACE

T.Skimming addresses accessing the User Data (stored on the TOE or
  transferred between the TOE and the terminal) using the TOE's
  contactless/contact interface. This threat is countered by the security
  objectives        OT.Data_Integrity,        OT.Data_Authenticity        and
  OT.Data_Confidentiality through the PACE authentication. The objective
  OE.Travel_Document_Holder ensures that a PACE session can only be
  established either by the travel document holder itself or by an authorised
  person or device, and, hence, cannot be captured by an attacker.

T.Eavesdropping addresses listening to the communicatiECOVERY
                      •   OT.SCP.SUPPORT instead of OE.SCP.SUPPORT
                      •   OT.SCP.IC instead of OE.SCP.IC
                      •   OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT instead of OE.CARD-MANAGEMENT
                      OT.SCP.RECOVERY, OT.SCP.SUPPORT, and OT.SCP.IC are objectives for the
                      TOE as the Smart Card Platform belongs to the TOE for this evaluation. OT.CARD-
                      MANAGEMENT is an objective for the TOE as the Card Manager belongs to the TOE
                      for this evaluation. Moving objectives from the environment to the TOE adds objectives
                      to the TOE without changing the overall objectives. The statement of security objectives
                      is therefore equivalent to the security objectives in the PP [6] to which conformance is
                      claimed.
