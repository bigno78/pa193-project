A.      Certification

1.      Preliminary Remarks
Under the BSIG1 Act, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) has the task of
issuing certificates for information technology products.
Certification of a product is carried out on the instigation of the vendor or a distributor,
hereinafter called the sponsor.
A part of the procedure is the technical examination (evaluation) of the product according
to the security criteria published by the BSI or generally recognised security criteria.
The evaluation is normally carried out by an evaluation facility recognised by the BSI or by
BSI itself.
The result of the certification procedure is the present Certification Report. This report
contains among others the certificate (summarised assessment) and the detailed
Certification Results.
The Certification Results contain the technical description of the security functionality of
the certified product, the details of the evaluation (strength and weaknesses) and
instructions for the user.

2.      Specifications of the Certification Procedure
The certification body conducts the procedure according to the criteria laid down in the
following:
●   Act on the Federal Office for Information Security 1
●   BSI Certification and Approval Ordinance2
●   BSI Schedule of Costs 3
●   Special decrees issued by the Bundesministerium des Innern (Federal Ministry of the
    Interior)
●   DIN EN ISO/IEC 17065 standard
●   BSI certification: Scheme documentation describing the certification process (CC-
    Produkte) [3]
●   BSI certification: Scheme documentation on requirements for the Evaluation Facility, its
    approval and licencing process (CC-Stellen) [3]
●   Common Criteria for IT Security Evaluation (CC), Version 3.1 4 [1] also published as

3.      Recognition Agreements
In order to avoid multiple certification of the same product in different countries a mutual
recognition of IT security certificates - as far as such certificates are based on ITSEC or
CC - under certain conditions was agreed.

3.1.    European Recognition of CC – Certificates (SOGIS-MRA)
The SOGIS-Mutual Recognition Agreement (SOGIS-MRA) Version 3 became effective in
April 2010. It defines the recognition of certificates for IT-Products at a basic recognition
level and, in addition, at higher recognition levels for IT-Products related to certain SOGIS
Technical Domains only.
The basic recognition level includes Common Criteria (CC) Evaluation Assurance Levels
EAL 1 to EAL 4. For "Smartcards and similar devices" a SOGIS Technical Domain is in
place. For "HW Devices with Security Boxes" a SOGIS Technical Domains is in place, too.
In addition, certificates issued for Protection Profiles based on Common Criteria are part of
the recognition agreement.
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes, details on
recognition, and the history of the agreement can be seen on the website at
https://www.sogis.eu.
The SOGIS-MRA logo printed on the certificate indicates that it is recognised under the
terms of this agreement by the related bodies of the signatory nations. A disclaimer
beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of recognition.
This certificate is recognized under SOGIS-MRA for all assurance components selected.

3.2.    International Recognition of CC – Certificates (CCRA)
The international arrangement on the mutual recognition of certificates based on the CC
(Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement, CCRA-2014) has been ratified on 08
September 2014. It covers CC certificates based on collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP)
(exact use), CC certificates based on assurance components up to and including EAL 2 or
the assurance family Flaw Remediation (ALC_FLR) and CC certificates for Protection
Profiles and for collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP).
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes can be seen on
the website: https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org.
The Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement logo printed on the certificate indicates
that this certification is recognised under the terms of this agreement by the related bodies
of the signatory nations. A disclaimer beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of
recognition.
This certificate is recognized according to the rules of CCRA-2014, i. e. up to and including
CC part 3 EAL 2+ ALC_FLR components.

4.      Performance of Evaluation and Certification
The certification body monitors each individual evaluation to ensure a uniform procedure, a
uniform interpretation of the criteria and uniform ratings.
The product Infineon Security Controller M7893 B11 with optional RSA2048/4096
v2.03.008, EC v2.03.008, SHA-2 v1.01, SCL v2.02.010 libraries and Toolbox v2.03.008
and with specific IC dedicated software (firmware), has undergone the certification
procedure at BSI. This is a re-certification based on BSI-DSZ-CC-0879-V3-2018. Specific
results from the evaluation process BSI-DSZ-CC-0879-V3-2018 were re-used.
The evaluation of the product Infineon Security Controller M7893 B11 with optional
RSA2048/4096 v2.03.008, EC v2.03.008, SHA-2 v1.01, SCL v2.02.010 libraries and
Toolbox v2.03.008 and with specific IC dedicated software (firmware), was conducted by
TÜV Informationstechnik GmbH. The evaluation was completed on 11 February 2020.
TÜV Informationstechnik GmbH is an evaluation facility (ITSEF) 5 recognised by the
certification body of BSI.
For this certification procedure the sponsor and applicant is: Infineon Technologies AG.
The product was developed by: Infineon Technologies AG.
The certification is concluded with the comparability check and the production of this
Certification Report. This work was completed by the BSI.

5.      Validity of the Certification Result
This Certification Report applies only to the version of the product as indicated. The
confirmed assurance package is valid on the condition that
●   all stipulations regarding generation, configuration and operation, as given in the
    following report, are observed,
●   the product is operated in the environment described, as specified in the following report
    and in the Security Target.
For the meaning of the assurance components and assurance levels please refer to CC
itself. Detailed references are listed in part C of this report.
The Certificate issued confirms the assurance of the product claimed in the Security Target
at the date of certification. As attack methods evolve over time, the resistance of the
certified version of the product against new attack methods needs to be re-assessed.
Therefore, the sponsor should apply for the certified product being monitored within the
assurance continuity program of the BSI Certification Scheme (e.g. by a re-assessment or
re-certification). Specifically, if results of the certification are used in subsequent evaluation
and certification procedures, in a system integration process or if a user's risk
management needs regularly updated results, it is recommended to perform a re-
assessment on a regular e.g. annual basis.
In order to avoid an indefinite usage of the certificate when evolved attack methods would
require a re-assessment of the products resistance to state of the art attack methods, the
maximum validity of the certificate has been limited. The certificate issued on 12 February
2020 is valid until 11 February 2025. Validity can be re-newed by re-certification.
The owner of the certificate is obliged:

     3. to inform the Certification Body at BSI immediately in the case that security relevant
        changes in the evaluated life cycle, e.g. related to development and production sites
        or processes, occur, or the confidentiality of documentation and information related
        to the Target of Evaluation (TOE) or resulting from the evaluation and certification
        procedure where the certification of the product has assumed this confidentiality
        being maintained, is not given any longer. In particular, prior to the dissemination of
        confidential documentation and information related to the TOE or resulting from the
        evaluation and certification procedure that do not belong to the deliverables
        according to the Certification Report part B, or for those where no dissemination
        rules have been agreed on, to third parties, the Certification Body at BSI has to be
        informed.
In case of changes to the certified version of the product, the validity can be extended to
the new versions and releases, provided the sponsor applies for assurance continuity (i.e.
re-certification or maintenance) of the modified product, in accordance with the procedural
requirements, and the evaluation does not reveal any security deficiencies.

1.     Executive Summary
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is an Infineon Security Controller M7893 B11 with optional
Software Library RSA2048/4096 v2.03.008, EC v2.03.008, SHA-2 v1.01, SCL v2.02.010
libraries, and Toolbox v2.03.008, as well as with specific IC dedicated software (firmware).
The TOE provides a real 16-bit CPU-architecture and is compatible to the 80251
microcontroller architecture. The major components of the core system are the two CPUs
(Central Processing Units), acting as one, the MMU (Memory Management Unit) and MED
(Memory Encryption/Decryption Unit). The dual interface controller is able to communicate
using either the contact based or the contactless interface.
The TOE consists of the hardware part, the firmware parts and the software parts.
The software parts are differentiated into the cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, and SHA-2,
symmetric cryptographic libraries and the supporting libraries Toolbox and Base. The Base
Library does not provide any specific security functionality on its own. However it is a
necessary perquisite in order to use the RSA, EC and Toolbox libraries.
This TOE is intended to be used in smart cards and other form factors for particularly
security-relevant applications and for its prevalent use as developing platform for smart
card operating systems. The term Smartcard Embedded Software is used in the following
for all operating systems and applications stored and executed on the TOE. The TOE is
the platform for the Smartcard Embedded Software.
The Security Target [6] is the basis for this certification. It is based on the certified
Protection Profile Security IC Platform Protection Profile, Version 1.0, 15 June 2007, BSI-
CC-PP-0035-2007 [8]. The TOE Security Functional Requirements are implemented by
the following TOE Security Functionality:
  TOE Security Functionality         Addressed issue
  SF_DPM                             Device Phase Management:
                                     The life cycle of the TOE is split up into several
                                     phases. Different operation modes help to protect
                                     the TOE during each phase of its lifecycle.
  SF_PS                              Protection against Snooping:
                                     The TOE uses various means to protect from
                                     snooping of memories and busses and prevents
                                     single stepping.
  SF_PMA                             Protection against Modifying Attacks:
                                     This TOE implements protection against
                                     modifying attacks of memories, alarm lines and
                                     sensors.
  SF_PLA                             Protection against Logical Attacks:
                                     The memory access control of the TOE uses a
                                     memory management unit (MMU) to control the
                                     access to the available physical memory by using
                                     virtual memory addresses and to segregate the
                                     code and data to a privilege level model. The
                                     MMU controls the address permissions of up
                                     seven privileged levels and gives the software the
                                     possibility to define different access rights. The
                                     address permissions of the privilege levels are




                                                                                                11 / 33

                                       controlled by the MMU. In case of an access
                                       violation the MMU will trigger a reset and then a
                                       trap service routine can react on the access
                                       violation.
  SF_CS                                Cryptographic Support:
                                       The TOE is equipped with several hardware
                                       accelerators and software modules to support the
                                       standard      symmetric     and       asymmetric
                                       cryptographic operations. The components are a
                                       coprocessor supporting the DES and AES
                                       algorithms and a combination of a coprocessor
                                       and software modules to support RSA
                                       cryptography, RSA key generation, ECDSA
                                       signature generation and verification, ECDH key
                                       agreement and EC public key calculation and
                                       public key testing. Furthermore, the TOE is
                                       equipped with an optional SHA-2 library and
                                       HASH module as well as well as an AIS31
                                       conformant TRNG that meets the functionality

                                     Table 2: Deliverables of the TOE

The delivery documentation describes all procedures that are necessary to maintain
security when distributing versions of the TOE or parts of it to the user’s site including the
necessary intermediate delivery procedures.
Furthermore, the delivery documentation describes in a sufficient manner how the various
procedures and technical measures provide for the detection of modifications and any
discrepancies between the TOE respective parts of it send by the TOE Manufacturer and
the version received by the Composite Product Manufacturer.
Three different delivery procedures have to be taken into consideration:
    ●   Delivery of the IC dedicated software components (IC dedicated SW, guidance)
        from the TOE Manufacturer to the IC Embedded Software Developer.
    ●   Delivery of the IC Embedded Software (ROM / Flash data, initialisation and pre-
        personalisation data) from the IC Embedded Software Developer to the TOE
        Manufacturer.
    ●   Delivery of the final TOE from the TOE Manufacturer to the Composite Product
        Manufacturer. After phase 3 the TOE is delivered in form of wafers or sawn wafers,
        after phase 4 in form of modules (with or without inlay antenna).
Respective distribution centers are listed in Appendix B (see below).
The individuaific
configured, not flashed and not personalized TOE products to the user warehouse.
Extra authentication means applied in the PIN-Letter status of the Flash Loader preserve that only the intended
user with the intended PIN-Letter can configure with user specific information and enable the normal Flash
Loader functions in a second step. By that the user orders the products and receives - in a protected way - the
belonging PIN-Letter. PIN-Letter and delivered chips must match.
By delivery the user warehouse gets filled and depending on market demands the user can immediate apply the
authentication means of the PIN-letter. If passing, the TOE products become user specific configured and the
Flash Loader can be used for this specific user in a second step.
The following table outlines the different ways how the user can input his software on this TOE – a TOE without
user available ROM. User software comprises usually the operating system and applications, which are for
Infineon Technologies simply a user data package which is handled as a fixed data package during production.
This provides high process flexibility for the user of which an overview is given in the following table:

For the cases with active Flash Loader on board and whenever the user has finalized his SW-download,
respectively the TOE is in the final state and about to be delivered to the end-user, the user is obligated to lock
the Flash Loader. This locking is the final step and results in a permanent deactivation of the Flash Loader. This
means that once being in the locked status, the Flash Loader cannot be reactivated anymore.
Note that whenever a TOE comes without active Flash Loader, BPU and PIN-Letter process are not possible.
All in all various delivery combinations are given and for example, a product can come with a fix configuration
and with Flash Loader, to enable the user to download software, but without BPU option and with PIN-Letter.
The following cases can occur:

The listing provided in the confidential security target [8] contains the memory size ranges and other blocking
options, focusing on the maximum respectively minimum user available limitations. Within those limitations the
TOE configurations can vary under only one identical IC-hardware, regardless whether the configurations are set
by Infineon or within further limitations by the user. All configurations throughout all different mask sets the
TOE is made off and all thereof resulting derivatives have no impact on security and are covered by the
certificate.

Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)


Note that this TOE has no user available ROM. The user software and data are entirely located in a dedicated and
protected part of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The long life storage endurance together with the means for error
detection and correction serves for excellent reliability and endurance.
In addition to the above listed flexible ranges, the user guidance contains a number of predefined configurations
for those customers not making use of the BPU option. All of these configurations belong to the TOE as well and
are of course made of the equal hardware and are inside the above declared ranges.
Today’s predefined configurations of the TOE are listed in the hardware reference manual HRM [1] and is
completed with the list of identification data of the derivatives. These predefined products come with the most
requested configurations and enables to produce volumes on stock in order to simplify logistic processes.
According to the BPU option, a non-limited number of configurations of the TOE may occur in the field. The
number of various configurations depends on the user and order contract only.
This TOE provides dedicated identification means and outputs the platform identifier, the design step and
further configuration information. The hardware reference manual HRM [1] is part of the user guidance and
enables for the clear interpretation of the read out identification data. More information is given in the
confidential Security Target [8].
These output data enable the user for clear identification of the TOE and also of one of the different mask sets
and therewith for examination of the validity of the certificate.
In addition, a dedicated RMS function allows reading out the present configuration in detail. The output RMS
data together with the hardware reference manual HRM [1] enables for clear identification of a product and its
configuration. All these steps for gathering identification and detailed configuration information can be done by
the user without involving the vendor, Infineon Technologies AG.

The TOE consists of the hardware part, the firmware parts in the alternative versions and the optional software
parts. The Smartcard Embedded Software, i.e. the operating system and applications are not part of the TOE.

The firmware comes with several alternative versions and consists of:
    the Boot Software (BOS) firmware conducting configuration and testing task (see chapter 2.2.2) at start-
        up of the TOE
    the Resource Management System (RMS) library providing essential basis functions for the management
        of the RAM, the branch table, the Memory Management Unit (MMU) and other resources
    the optional Flash Loader enabling for the download of user software to the SOLID FLASH™ NVM and
        required for the optional Bill per Use (BPU) feature and the PIN-letter feature
    the Radio Frequency Application Interface (RFAPI) supporting functions located in the ROM.
        The RFAPI functions are not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF)
    the NRG ROM part implementing some basic routines and used by the NRG if ordered.
        The NRG ROM part is not part of the TSF functionality.

The firmware parts BOS, RFAPI and NRG are implemented in a separated Test-ROM also being part of the TOE
but not available for the user. Completing firmware components are located in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM.

The optional software parts are differentiated into following libraries:
    The asymmetric cryptographic libraries (ACL) in following alternative versions:
       v2.08.007, v2.07.003 and v2.06.003.
           o All ACL libraries provide RSA1 2048/4096 cryptography.
                The library supports also smaller key lengths, but the certification follows the national regulation
                by the BSI1.

        the NRG Software. The NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

The RSA, EC and Toolbox libraries provide certain functionality via an API to the Smartcard Embedded Software.
The private parts of the cryptographic libraries are only used internally and have no user interface. If neither the
RSA- nor the EC library is delivered, also the belonging private parts are not on board. The Toolbox library does
not have private library parts.
Each of the libraries ACL, SCL, HSL and NRG is independent from the other libraries and also independent of the
alternative library version of the equal type. This means for example that the HSL-1 runs alone and does not need
parts of HSL-2.
A combination respectively mix up of the two alternative libraries of equal type has not been considered in the
design and is not allowed: The user can select either one or the other of the same library type or none of it.
If the user considers the optional software libraries, the TOE can be delivered including – in free combinations –
or not including any of the optional libraries.

If the user decides not to use any of the offered asymmetric cryptographic libraries, regardless of the version
chosen, none of the cryptographic libraries is consequently delivered and the accompanying Additional Specific
Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions) Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and/ or EC is/are not provided by the
TOE. Else it depends of the chosen library whether the Additional Specific Security Functionality
(O.Add-Functions) Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and/ or EC is/are supported.

The Toolbox library, regardless of the version chosen, provides the user optionally basic arithmetic and modular
arithmetic operations, in order to support user software development using long integer operations. These basic
arithmetic operations do not provide security functionality, implement no security mechanism, and do not
proved additional specific security functionality – as defined for the cryptographic libraries.
The user developed software using the Toolbox basic operations is not part of the TOE.
The Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

The symmetric cryptographic library SCL – in both versions – offers a high level interface to perform the
cryptographic operations DES, TDES and AES with different key lengths on the symmetric cryptographic
coprocessor (SCP) for this TOE. In addition, the SCL in version v2.04.002 implements computation of a CMAC
using AES and 3DES algorithms.

 BSI – Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik – Federal Office for Information Security: Following the national BSI
    recommendations, RSA key lengths below 1976 bits are not included in the certificate. Please note that the BSI expects this key length

Public Security Target
Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)


The SCL implements already several block cipher modes as declared in this document and covering a wide range
of applications, the SCL offers in addition the flexibility to implement additional block cipher modes defined by
the user.
This library provides a simplified interface to the hardware Symmetric Cryptographic Coprocessor (SCP) and
preserves the security and performance requirements as required by the user.
Note that the definition of the key lengths follows the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100 bit security
level by the BSI. This excludes the single DES operation from the certification.

Beside the inclusion and support of cryptographic libraries this TOE comes with the optional Hardware Support
Library (HSL) in different versions significantly simplifying the management of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM
functionality. The HSL constitutes an application interface (API) accessing the HSL state machine and
abstracting low level properties like special function registers and settings of specific hardware features. In short
the HSL provides a user friendly also use case oriented interface considering endurance, reliability and
performance requirements.
In certain configurations each of the HSL versions provide also functions implementing tearing safe behaviour of
the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. If applied the user has no need to care about cases where the TOE is unintentionally
removed from the power supply or the radio frequency field even during managing the SOLID FLASH™ NVM.
Anyhow, the HSL – regardless of the version – remains as an optional library, as even sudden power off situations
do not lead to exploitable conditions of the TOE. In the worse, the TOE ends operation in case of a faulty
programmed SOLID FLASH™ NVM location.
In addition to the above, the HSL in version 03.12.8812 and 03.11.8339 provide an advanced additional method
called Incremental Write (IWR). This method provides enhanced endurance of the SOLID FLASH NVM even
beyond the erase endurance limits for often written objects. Thus this method serves applications with a demand
for high endurance and fast writing times. On the other hand, the read times using this method are slower than
the other methods provided.

The order option CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CIPURSE™ CL) provides cryptographic functionality to
implement a CIPURSE™ V2 conformant protocol.
This protocol provides a secure mutual authentication of two entities, namely the terminal (denoted as PCD =
Proximity Coupling Device (CIPURSE™-compliant terminal)) and a smart card or a token in other form factors
which is called PICC. PICC stands for Proximity Integrated Circuit Card (CIPURSE™-compliant card).
Beside the mutual authentication, the protocol implements measures to maintain the integrity of the transferred
data and preserves in parallel the confidentiality of the transferred data.
By that the CIPURSE™ CL supports the user to implement systems conformant to the CIPURSE™ open standard
implementing a secured, interoperable and flexible transit fare collection solution, including ISO 7816, ISO/IEC
14443-4 communication and AES-128 bit cryptography for multiple payment types.

The NRG Software is a further order option and implements the routines for a NRG interface. The NRG provides
an operating system handling the emulation of a NRG card together with the RF interface. One part of the NRG
is permanently stored in the ROM and the second part consisting of patch and API is located in the SOLID
FLASH™ NVM. The second part is only present if the NRG is part of the delivery. If the NRG is not part of the
delivery the ROM part is present but not used. The NRG implements tearing safe behaviour in context with the
SOLID FLASH™ NVM management and is therefore independent from the HSL. The NRG is not part of the TOE
Security Functionality (TSF).

Deselecting one of the optional libraries does not include the code implementing functionality, which the user
decided not to use. Not including the code of the deselected functionality has no impact of any other security
policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the situation where the user decides just not to use the functionality.

All optional software libraries are stored respectively can be loaded into the SOLID FLASH™ NVM.
All other Smartcard Embedded Software loaded into the SOLID FLASH™ NVM does not belong to the TOE and
is not subject of the evaluation.

1                     Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)
1.1                 Security Target and Target of Evaluation Reference
The title of this document is Security Target Lite Common Criteria EAL6 augmented / EAL6+ M7892 Design Step P11.

This     document     comprises    the     Infineon   Technologies    AG    Security   Controller    (Integrated   Circuit   IC),
M7892 Design Step P11, with specific IC dedicated firmware and optional software:

            RSA v2.03.008 or v2.07.003,

            EC v2.03.008 or v2.07.003,

            SHA-2 v1.01

            Toolbox v2.03.008 or v2.07.003

            Symmetric Crypto Library v2.02.010

In addition, the TOE is available with alternative firmware packages as versioned in Table 1: Identification.

The target of evaluation (TOE) M7892 Design Step P11 is described in the following.

The reference to the belonging confidential Security Target is given in chapter 9.

The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is the Infineon Security Controller, M7892 Design Step P11, with the optional libraries
RSA2048/4096 v2.03.008 or v2.07.003, EC v2.03.008 or v2.07.003, SHA-2 v1.01, Toolbox v2.03.008 or v2.07.003 , and
symmetric crypto library v2.02.010, as well as with specific IC dedicated firmware, including the Flash Loader enhanced by
the Mutual Authentication Extension (MAE).

The version of ECC, RSA and Toolbox libraries cannot be chosen independently. The libraries have to be of one version.

The design step of this TOE is P11.

The Security Target is based on the Protection Profile PP-0084 “Security IC Platform Protection Profile with Augmentation
Packages” [12] as publicly available for download at https://www.bsi.bund.de and certified under BSI-CC-PP-0084-2014. MAE
and Flash Loader are regarded by the definition of “loader package1+” according to “PP0084: Interpretations” [35].

The Protection Profile and the Security Target are built in compliance with Common Criteria v3.1.

The Security Target takes into account all relevant current final interpretations.

This TOE concept is based on the architecture, family concept and principles of the Integrity Guard implemented in the
controllers by Infineon Technologies AG deemed for high security requiring applications.

This TOE is based and built from the equal design sources as already certified in the forerunner process BSI-DSZ-CC-0891-V4-
2019 and has seen further improvements.

The certification body of this process is the German BSI, whereas the abbreviation stands for Federal Office for Information
Security, in German Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik.

The user can identify the TOE and its configuration using the Non-ISO ATR in combination with firmware functions. The TOE
answers the Non-ISO ATR with the Generic Chip Identification Mode (GCIM). The GCIM outputs a chip identifier byte, design
step, firmware identifier version and further configuration information. The identification data and configuration details are
described in the confidential Security Target [10] and in the Family Hardware Reference Manual HRM [1].

Furthermore, the MAE can be identified utilising its version, as described in the Production and personalization Mutual
Authentication Extension [36]. The version is part of the “basic chip information” provided by the command
FLASH_GET_CHIP_STATUS.

This TOE is represented by various products, differentiated by various configuration possibilities, done either by Infineon
settings during production or, after delivery, by means of blocking at customer premises.

Despite these configuration possibilities, all products are derived from the equal hardware design results, the M7892 Design
Step P11. The GCIM mode is explained and detailed in the user guidance document hardware reference manual HRM [1].

All product derivatives are identically from module design, layout and footprint, but are made different in their possibilities
to connect to different types of antennas or to a contact based interface only. Therefore, the TOE is represented and made
out of different mask sets:
The main difference between the mask sets of the TOE is on one metal mask (M1) to implement different input capacitances
in the analogue part of the radio frequency interface (RFI). This differentiation in the input capacitances allows the
connection to a wider range of various antenna types, or respectively, to a contact based interface only. Note that external
antennas or interfaces are not part of the TOE.

An overview upon the different mask sets is provided in the Confidential Security Target [10].

To each of the capacitances related mask sets belonging to the TOE, an individual value is assigned, which is part of the data
output of the Generic Chip Identification Mode (GCIM). This number is located in the GCIM part individual length byte to
clearly differentiate between the mask sets related to the different input capacitances. Thereby, the clear identification of
the silicon design step is given.

There are no other differences between the mask sets the TOE is produced with. Details are explained in the user guidance
hardware reference manual HRM [1]. An overview upon the different mask sets is given in the confidential Security Target
[10].

The M7892 Design Step P11 allows for a maximum of configuration possibilities defined by the customer order or his blocking
following the market needs. For example, a M7892 Design Step P11 product can come in one project with the fully available
                        1
SOLID FLASH™ NVM or in another project with any other SOLID FLASH™ NVM -size below the physical implementation size,
or with a different RAM size. And more, the user has the free choice, whether he needs the symmetric coprocessor SCP, or
the asymmetric coprocessor Crypto@2304T, or both, or none of them. In addition, the user decides, whether the TOE comes
with a free combination of software libraries or without any. However, the version of ECC, RSA and Toolbox libraries cannot
be chosen independently. If selected the libraries have to be of one version. And, to be even more flexible, various interface
options can be chosen as well. To sum up the major selections, the user defines by his order:

             The available memory sizes of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM and RAM.
              Note that there is no user available ROM on the TOE.

             The availability of the cryptographic coprocessors.

             The availability of the optional cryptographic libraries.

             The availability of Mutual Authentication Extension (MAE) and Flash Loader for available interfaces like ISO-7816,
              contactless ISO-14443.

             The availability of various interface options.

             The possibility to tailor the product by blocking on his own premises.

             The degree of freedom of the chip configuration is predefined by Infineon Technologies AG and made available via
              the order tool.

Beside fix TOE configurations, which can be ordered as usual, this TOE implements optionally the so called Bill-Per-Use (BPU)
ability. This solution enables our customer to tailor the product on his own to the required configuration – project by project.
By that BPU allows for significant reduction of logistic cost at all participating parties and serves for acceleration of delivery of
tailored product to the end-user.

BPU enables our customers to block the chip on demand into the final configuration at his own premises, without further
delivery or involving support by Infineon Technology Further information is given in the confidential Security Target [10].

The entire configuration storage area is protected against manipulation, perturbation and false access. Note that the IFX-only
part of the configuration page is already access protected prior delivery to the user and the TOE leaves the Infineon
Technology premises only locked into User Mode.

The Flash Loader BPU software part is only present on the products which have been ordered with the BPU option. In all
other cases this software is not present on the product. If a product is ordered without Flash Loader, also the Flash Loader
software is not present and the BPU configuration changes are blocked in the IFX-configuration, which renders BPU
functionality unusable. Various delivery combinations are given and for example, a product can come with a fix configuration
and with Flash Loader, to enable the user to download software, but without BPU option. Following cases can occur:

          
                                                                           1
              Order in fixed configuration, without activatable MAE and Flash Loader:
              no download of user software and no blocking possibility after delivery

             Order in fixed configuration with activatable MAE and Flash Loader but without BPU option:
              download of user software but no blocking possibility after delivery

             Order with activatable MAE and Flash Loader and Bill-per-Use option in starting configuration:
              final chip configuration by the user and download of user software

In case a customer decides to order the TOE with activatable MAE and Flash Loader, he has to make sure that the Flash
Loader is protected against misuse. This explicitly includes the delivery process from Infineon to the customer. In addition,
the Flash Loader has to be used in an MSSR-audited environment. Furthermore, the Flash Loader (and MAE) has to be

    „Activatable MAE“ means either that MAE is installed and will be active after power-up / reset of the TOE, or that MAE can be reinstalled
      and activated via the Flash Loader.

                                     Table 2: Deliverables of the TOE

The delivery documentation describes all procedures that are necessary to maintain
security when distributing versions of the TOE or parts of it to the user’s site including the
necessary intermediate delivery procedures.
Furthermore, the delivery documentation describes in a sufficient manner how the various
procedures and technical measures provide for the detection of modifications and any
discrepancies between the TOE respective parts of it send by the TOE Manufacturer and
the version received by the Composite Product Manufacturer.
Three different delivery procedures have to be taken into consideration:
    ●   Delivery of the IC dedicated software components (IC dedicated SW, guidance)
        from the TOE Manufacturer to the IC Embedded Software Developer.
    ●   Delivery of the IC Embedded Software (ROM / Flash data, initialisation and pre-
        personalisation data) from the IC Embedded Software Developer to the TOE
        Manufacturer.
    ●   Delivery of the final TOE from the TOE Manufacturer to the Composite Product
        Manufacturer. After phase 3 the TOE is delivered in form of wafers or sawn wafers,
        after phase 4 in form of modules (with or without inlay antenna).
Respective distribution centers are listed in Appendix B (see below).
The individuaific
configured, not flashed and not personalized TOE products to the user warehouse.
Extra authentication means applied in the PIN-Letter status of the Flash Loader preserve that only the intended
user with the intended PIN-Letter can configure with user specific information and enable the normal Flash
Loader functions in a second step. By that the user orders the products and receives - in a protected way - the
belonging PIN-Letter. PIN-Letter and delivered chips must match.
By delivery the user warehouse gets filled and depending on market demands the user can immediate apply the
authentication means of the PIN-letter. If passing, the TOE products become user specific configured and the
Flash Loader can be used for this specific user in a second step.
The following table outlines the different ways how the user can input his software on this TOE – a TOE without
user available ROM. User software comprises usually the operating system and applications, which are for
Infineon Technologies simply a user data package which is handled as a fixed data package during production.
This provides high process flexibility for the user of which an overview is given in the following table:

For the cases with active Flash Loader on board and whenever the user has finalized his SW-download,
respectively the TOE is in the final state and about to be delivered to the end-user, the user is obligated to lock
the Flash Loader. This locking is the final step and results in a permanent deactivation of the Flash Loader. This
means that once being in the locked status, the Flash Loader cannot be reactivated anymore.
Note that whenever a TOE comes without active Flash Loader, BPU and PIN-Letter process are not possible.
All in all various delivery combinations are given and for example, a product can come with a fix configuration
and with Flash Loader, to enable the user to download software, but without BPU option and with PIN-Letter.

The listing provided in the confidential security target [8] contains the memory size ranges and other blocking
options, focusing on the maximum respectively minimum user available limitations. Within those limitations the
TOE configurations can vary under only one identical IC-hardware, regardless whether the configurations are set
by Infineon or within further limitations by the user. All configurations throughout all different mask sets the
TOE is made off and all thereof resulting derivatives have no impact on security and are covered by the
certificate.

Note that this TOE has no user available ROM. The user software and data are entirely located in a dedicated and
protected part of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The long life storage endurance together with the means for error
detection and correction serves for excellent reliability and endurance.
In addition to the above listed flexible ranges, the user guidance contains a number of predefined configurations
for those customers not making use of the BPU option. All of these configurations belong to the TOE as well and
are of course made of the equal hardware and are inside the above declared ranges.
Today’s predefined configurations of the TOE are listed in the hardware reference manual HRM [1] and is
completed with the list of identification data of the derivatives. These predefined products come with the most
requested configurations and enables to produce volumes on stock in order to simplify logistic processes.
According to the BPU option, a non-limited number of configurations of the TOE may occur in the field. The
number of various configurations depends on the user and order contract only.
This TOE provides dedicated identification means and outputs the platform identifier, the design step and
further configuration information. The hardware reference manual HRM [1] is part of the user guidance and
enables for the clear interpretation of the read out identification data. More information is given in the
confidential Security Target [8].
These output data enable the user for clear identification of the TOE and also of one of the different mask sets
and therewith for examination of the validity of the certificate.
In addition, a dedicated RMS function allows reading out the present configuration in detail. The output RMS
data together with the hardware reference manual HRM [1] enables for clear identification of a product and its
configuration. All these steps for gathering identification and detailed configuration information can be done by
the user without involving the vendor, Infineon Technologies AG.

The TOE consists of the hardware part, the firmware parts in the alternative versions and the optional software
parts. The Smartcard Embedded Software, i.e. the operating system and applications are not part of the TOE.

The firmware comes with several alternative versions and consists of:
    the Boot Software (BOS) firmware conducting configuration and testing task (see chapter 2.2.2) at start-
        up of the TOE
    the Resource Management System (RMS) library providing essential basis functions for the management
        of the RAM, the branch table, the Memory Management Unit (MMU) and other resources
    the optional Flash Loader enabling for the download of user software to the SOLID FLASH™ NVM and
        required for the optional Bill per Use (BPU) feature and the PIN-letter feature
    the Radio Frequency Application Interface (RFAPI) supporting functions located in the ROM.
        The RFAPI functions are not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF)
    the NRG ROM part implementing some basic routines and used by the NRG if ordered.
        The NRG ROM part is not part of the TSF functionality.

The firmware parts BOS, RFAPI and NRG are implemented in a separated Test-ROM also being part of the TOE
but not available for the user. Completing firmware components are located in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM.

The optional software parts are differentiated into following libraries:
    The asymmetric cryptographic libraries (ACL) in following alternative versions:
       v2.08.007, v2.07.003 and v2.06.003.
           o All ACL libraries provide RSA1 2048/4096 cryptography.
                The library supports also smaller key lengths, but the certification follows the national regulation
                by the BSI1.

        the NRG Software. The NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

The RSA, EC and Toolbox libraries provide certain functionality via an API to the Smartcard Embedded Software.
The private parts of the cryptographic libraries are only used internally and have no user interface. If neither the
RSA- nor the EC library is delivered, also the belonging private parts are not on board. The Toolbox library does
not have private library parts.
Each of the libraries ACL, SCL, HSL and NRG is independent from the other libraries and also independent of the
alternative library version of the equal type. This means for example that the HSL-1 runs alone and does not need
parts of HSL-2.
A combination respectively mix up of the two alternative libraries of equal type has not been considered in the
design and is not allowed: The user can select either one or the other of the same library type or none of it.
If the user considers the optional software libraries, the TOE can be delivered including – in free combinations –
or not including any of the optional libraries.

If the user decides not to use any of the offered asymmetric cryptographic libraries, regardless of the version
chosen, none of the cryptographic libraries is consequently delivered and the accompanying Additional Specific
Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions) Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and/ or EC is/are not provided by the
TOE. Else it depends of the chosen library whether the Additional Specific Security Functionality
(O.Add-Functions) Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and/ or EC is/are supported.

The Toolbox library, regardless of the version chosen, provides the user optionally basic arithmetic and modular
arithmetic operations, in order to support user software development using long integer operations. These basic
arithmetic operations do not provide security functionality, implement no security mechanism, and do not
proved additional specific security functionality – as defined for the cryptographic libraries.
The user developed software using the Toolbox basic operations is not part of the TOE.
The Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

The symmetric cryptographic library SCL – in both versions – offers a high level interface to perform the
cryptographic operations DES, TDES and AES with different key lengths on the symmetric cryptographic
coprocessor (SCP) for this TOE. In addition, the SCL in version v2.04.002 implements computation of a CMAC
using AES and 3DES algorithms.

Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)


The SCL implements already several block cipher modes as declared in this document and covering a wide range
of applications, the SCL offers in addition the flexibility to implement additional block cipher modes defined by
the user.
This library provides a simplified interface to the hardware Symmetric Cryptographic Coprocessor (SCP) and
preserves the security and performance requirements as required by the user.
Note that the definition of the key lengths follows the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100 bit security
level by the BSI. This excludes the single DES operation from the certification.

Beside the inclusion and support of cryptographic libraries this TOE comes with the optional Hardware Support
Library (HSL) in different versions significantly simplifying the management of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM
functionality. The HSL constitutes an application interface (API) accessing the HSL state machine and
abstracting low level properties like special function registers and settings of specific hardips are delivered to the end-customer. These aspects are not within the scope of this
evaluation but have to be considered for a composite TOE.

Beside the various TOE configurations further possibilities of how the user inputs his software on the TOE, i.e. the operating
system and applications, are in place. This provides a maximum of flexibility and for this an overview is given in the following
table:

                                                                    download his software in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM.

          FLASH™ NVM during chip production. I.e. there are
                                                                    reactivation procedure in software prior chip production

For the cases with activatable MAE and Flash Loader on board and whenever the user has finalized his software download,
respectively the TOE is in the final state and about to be delivered to the end-user, the user is obligated to lock the Flash
Loader. The locking is the final step and results in a permanent deactivation of the Flash Loader. This means that once being
in the locked status, the Flash Loader cannot be reactivated anymore. In locked state it is also impossible to re-install/activate
the MAE (as this would need an active Flash Loader).

Note that whenever a TOE comes with a permanently deactivated the Flash Loader, BPU is not possible.

The following listing contains the memory size ranges and other blocking options, focusing on the maximum respectively
minimum user available limitations. Within those limitations the TOE configurations can vary under only one identical IC-
hardware, regardless whether the configurations are set by Infineon or within further limitations by the user. All

dedicated and protected part of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The long life storage endurance, the automatic management of
often used memory pages, together with the means for error detection and correction serves for comparable respectively
equal reliability and endurance, compared to a conventional ROM.

Beside the above listed flexible ranges, the user guidance contains a number of predefined configurations for those
customers not making use of the BPU option. All of these configurations belong to the TOE as well and are of course made of
the equal hardware and are inside the above declared ranges.

According to the BPU option, a non-limited number of configurations of the TOE may occur in the field. The number of
various configurations depends on the user and purchase contract only.

Note that the TOE answers to the Non-ISO-ATR with the Generic Chip Identification Mode (GCIM) answer. This GCIM outputs
a coded clear identifier for the chip type, the design step and further configuration information such as the firmware version.
The user guidance document hardware reference manual HRM [1] enables for clear interpretation of the read out GCIM data.

These GCIM data enable the user for clear identification of the TOE and also of one of the different mask sets and therewith
for checking the validity of the certificate.

In addition, a dedicated RMS function allows reading out the present configuration in detail. Together with the programmer’s
reference manual (PRM) [3], this allows for clear identification of a product and its configuration.

All these steps for gathering identification and detailed configuration information can be done by the user himself, without
involving Infineon Technologies AG.

The TOE consists of the hardware part, the firmware parts and the optional software parts. The Smartcard Embedded
Software, i.e. the operating system and applications are not part of the TOE.

The firmware parts are the RMS, the Service Algorithm Minimal (SAM) the STS firmware for test purpose, the NRG software
interface routines, as well as the MAE enhanced Flash Loader for downloading user software to the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. For
further details regarding the firmware refer to chapter 2.2.2.Firmware patches (if there are any present) are stored in the
SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The TOE has no user ROM. IFX ROM contains no user data.

Please note that the NRG software is not part of the security functionality of the TOE.
                                                                                     1    2        3
The software parts are differentiated into the cryptographic libraries RSA , EC SHA-2 , and symmetric cryptographic library
(SCL), as well as the supporting libraries Toolbox and Base.

These libraries provide the Smartcard Embedded Software with a certain functionality via an API. However, the Base Library
does not provided a dedicated functionality on its own and is mainly used internally by the RSA, EC and Toolbox libraries. If
none of the libraries RSA, EC and Toolbox is delivered, also the Base Library is not on board.

Thus the customer can choose, whether the TOE is delivered including - in free combinations - the functionality of the
cryptographic libraries SCL, EC, RSA, SHA-2 and the supporting Toolbox library. However, the version of ECC, RSA and Toolbox
libraries cannot be chosen independently. If selected the libraries have to be of one version. If RSA or EC or Toolbox is
delivered, automatically the Base Library is part of the shipment too.

If the user decides not to use one or all of the crypto library(s), the specific library(s) is (are) not delivered to the user and the
accompanying additional specific security functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and/ or EC and/or SHA-2 and/or SCL
based Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and SCL based Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES) is/are not provided by the
TOE.

The optional Toolbox library provides the user with basic arithmetic and modular arithmetic operations, in order to support
user software development using long integer operations. These basic arithmetic operations do not provide any security
functionality, implement no security mechanism, and do not provide additional specific security functionality - as defined for
the cryptographic libraries.
The user developed software using the Toolbox basic operations is not part of the TOE.

The Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF) of this TOE and does not provide any security functional
requirement.

The Base Library provides the low level interface to the asymmetric cryptographic coprocessor for the RSA, EC and Toolbox
libraries. The Base Library does not provide any dedicated security functionality on its own.

Deselecting one of the libraries does not include the code implementing functionality, which the user decided not to use. Not
including the code of the deselected functionality has no impact of any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly
equivalent to the situation where the user decides just not to use the functionality.

The SCL, RSA, EC, SHA-2 and Toolbox libraries can be loaded, together with the Smartcard Embedded software, into the
SOLID FLASH™ NVM. This holds also for the Base Library, if the RSA, EC or Toolbox or combinations hereof is/are part of the
shipment.

The Smartcard Embedded Software does not belong to the TOE and is not subject of the evaluation.


1.2                Target of Evaluation overview
The TOE comprises the Infineon Technologies Dual Interface Security Controller M7892 Design Step P11 with specific IC
dedicated firmware and optional SCL, RSA, EC, SHA-2 and Toolbox libraries.

The TOE is a member of the Infineon Technologies AG high security controller family meeting the highest requirements in
terms of performance and security. A summary product description is given in this Security Target (ST).

This TOE is intended to be used in any application and device requiring the highest level of security, and can be used for
example not only as a secure smart card, but also as a secure element on a printed circuit board or similar. The capabilities of
this TOE can be used almost everywhere, where highly secure applications are in use and of course in any other application
as well. This TOE is deemed for governmental, corporate, transport and payment markets, or wherever a secure root of trust

is required. Various types of applications can use this TOE in almost any device or form factor, for example in closed loop
logical access controls, physical access controls, secure internet access control and internet authentication, or as multi-
application token or simply as encrypted storage.

This member of the high security controller family features a security philosophy focusing on data integrity instead of
numerous sensors. By that two main principles combined in close synergy are utilized in the security concept called the
“Integrity Guard”. These main principles are the comprehensive error detection, including the dual CPU, and the full
encrypted data path, leaving no plain data on the chip. These principles proved that they provide excellent protection against
invasive and non-invasive attacks known today.
                                                                                                                                 2
The intelligent shielding algorithm finishes the layers, finally providing the so called intelligent implicit active shielding “I -
shield”. This provides physical protection against probing and forcing.

This dual interface controller is able to communicate using either the contact based or the contactless interface. The
implemented dual interface provides a maximum flexibility in using following communication protocols respectively
methods:

Contact based interfaces

               ISO 7816
                The ISO defined standard contact based communication protocol, using the pads.

Contactless interfaces

               ISO 14443 Type A and Type B
                These are ISO defined proximity contactless protocols using an external antenna and the TOE implemented
                analogue and digital radio frequency interface.

               ISO/IEC 18092 passive mode,
                The ISO defined proximity contactless protocol using an external antenna and the TOE implemented analogue and
                digital radio frequency interface.

                The proprietary proximity contactless protocol using an external antenna and the TOE implemented analogue and
                digital radio frequency interface, as well as the memory part reserved for NRG use.

               And various further communication modes (see Note below).

Note:         All interfaces and protocols can be made available sequentially. How the interfaces are used or combined depends
exclusively on the user software. Further communication modes, details and an overview about their combinations are
outlined in the confidential Security Target [9].

The TOE provides a real 16-bit CPU-architecture and is compatible to the MCS®251 instruction set with an execution time
faster than a standard MCS®251 microcontroller at the same clock frequency. The major components of the core system are
the dual CPU (Central Processing Units), acting as one, the MMU (Memory Management Unit) and MED (Memory
Encryption/Decryption Unit). The dual CPU controls each other in order to detect faults and serve by this for data integrity.
The TOE implements a full 16 MByte linear addressable memory space for each privilege level, a simple scalable Memory

Management concept and a scalable stack size. The flexible memory concept consists of ROM- and Flash-memory as part of
the nonvolatile memory (NVM), respectively SOLID FLASH™ NVM. For the SOLID FLASH™ NVM the Unified Channel
Programming (UCP) memory technology is used.

The RMS library providing some functionality via an API to the Smartcard Embedded Software contains for example SOLID
FLASH™ NVM service routines. The Service Algorithm Minimal (SAM) provides functionality for the tearing-safe write into the
SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The STS firmware is used for test purposes during start-up and the MAE and Flash Loader allow for
mutual authentication with the TOE and secure downloading of user software to the SOLID FLASH™ NVM during the
manufacturing process. The firmware parts are implemented in the ROM and in access protected areas of the SOLID FLASH™
NVM.

The BSI has changed names and abbreviations for Random Number Generators, which is clarified as follows: The Physical
True Random Number Generator (PTRNG), also named True Random Number Generator (TRNG) is afreely be combined but not two versions of the equal type. For examples ACL with SCL with
HSL with NRG is welcome but a combination of HSL in version 03.11.8339 and at the same time with HSL in
version 01.22.4346 would not work. The library types are entirely independent from each other.
The security relevant differences in the versions - if any - are detailed in chapter 8. The claims of this Security
Target take the corresponding versions into account and thus the wording in the following refers to the library
type which is cited or else the claim includes always all named versions.

The design step of this TOE is H13.

The Security Target is based on the Protection Profile PP-0084 Security IC Platform Protection Profile with
Augmentation Packages [9] as publicly available for download at https://www.bsi.bund.de and certified under
BSI-CC-PP-0084-2014.
The Security Target is built in compliance with Common Criteria v3.1 Revision 5.

The Security Target takes into account all relevant current final interpretations.
