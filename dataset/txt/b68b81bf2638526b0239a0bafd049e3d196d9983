                              1.3 TOE Overview


                           1.3.1 Introduction
                                    The Hardware Security Target [13] contains, in section 1.3 ‚ÄúTOE Overview‚Äù, an
                                    introduction about the N7021 hardware TOE that is considered in the evaluation. The
                                    Hardware Security Target includes IC Dedicated Software provided with the N7021
                                    hardware platform.
                                    The ‚ÄúCrypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA‚Äú is a cryptographic library that can be used by
                                    the Security IC Embedded Software. The cryptographic library consists of several binary
                                    packages that are intended to be linked to the Security IC Embedded Software. The
                                    Security IC Embedded Software developer links the binary packages that he needs to his
                                    Embedded Software and the whole is subsequently implemented in arbitrary memory of
                                    the hardware platform.
                                    The NXP N7021 provides the computing platform and cryptographic support by means of
                                    co-processors for the Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA.
                                    The Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA provides the security functionality described
                                    below in addition to the functionality described in the Hardware Security Target [13] for
                                    the hardware platform:
                                    The Crypto Library provides RSA, RSA key generation, RSA public key computation,
                                    ECDSA (ECC over GF(p)) signature generation and verification, ECDSA (ECC over
                                    GF(p)) key generation, ECDH (ECC Diffie-Hellmann) key-exchange, standard security
                                    level SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512.

                           1.3.2 Life-Cycle
                                    The life cycle of the hardware platform as part of the TOE is described in section 1.4.4
                                    "Security During Development and Production" of the Hardware Security Target [13]. The
                                    delivery process or the hardware platform is independent from the Crypto Library Cobalt
                                    on N7021 VA.
                                    The Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA is delivered in Phase 1 (for a definition of the
                                    Phases refer to Section 1.2.3 'TOE life cycle‚Äô of the Protection Profile [5]) as a software
                                    package (a set of binary files) to the developers of Security IC Embedded Software. The
                                    Security IC Embedded Software may comprise in this case an operating system and/or
                                    other smart card software (applications). The Software developer can incorporate the
                                    Crypto Library into their product.
                                    The subsequent use of the Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA by Security IC Embedded
                                    Software Developers is out of the control of the developer NXP Semiconductors; the
                                    integration of the Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA into Security IC Embedded
                                    Software is not part of this evaluation.
                                    Security during Development and Production
                                    The development process of the Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA is part of the
                                    evaluation. The access to the implementation documentation, test bench and the source
                                    code is restricted to the development team of the Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA.
                                    The security measures installed within NXP, including a secure delivery process, ensure
                                    the integrity and quality of the delivered Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA binary files.

                           1.3.3 Specific Issues of Hardware and the Common Criteria
                                    Regarding the Application Note 2 of the Protection Profile [5] the TOE provides additional
                                    functionality which is not covered in the Protection profile [5] and the Hardware Security
                                    Target [13]. This additional functionality is added using the policy ‚ÄúP.Add-CryptoLib-
                                    Func‚Äù (see Section 3.3 of this Security Target).

                              1.4 TOE Description
                                    The Target of Evaluation (TOE) consists of a hardware part and a software part:

                                    ‚Ä¢ The RSA algorithm can be used for encryption and decryption as well as for signature
                                      generation, signature verification, message encoding and signature encoding.
                                    ‚Ä¢ The RSA key generation can be used to generate RSA key pairs.
                                    ‚Ä¢ The RSA public key computation can be used to compute the public key that belongs to
                                      a given private CRT key.
                                    The TOE supports various key sizes for RSA up to a limit of 4096 bits.
                                    RSA functionality is not available in case the customer disabled the PKCC coprocessor
                                    as part of the hardware configuration. See the Hardware Security Target [13] for more
                                    information.

                                    ‚Ä¢ The ECDSA (ECC over GF(p)) algorithm can be used for signature generation and
                                      signature verification.

                                    ‚Ä¢ The ECDH (ECC Diffie-Hellman) key exchange algorithm can be used to establish
                                      cryptographic keys. It can be also used as secure point multiplication.
                                    The TOE supports various key sizes for ECC over GF(p) up to a limit of 640 bits for
                                    signature generation, key pair generation and key exchange. For signature verification
                                    the TOE supports key sizes up to a limit of 640 bits.

                                    information.
                                    SHA
                                    ‚Ä¢ The SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 algorithms can be used for
                                      different purposes such as computing hash values in the course of digital signature
                                      creation or key derivation.
                                    Resistance of cryptographic algorithms against attacks
                                    The cryptographic algorithms are designed taking into account the attacks described in
                                    JIL-ATT-SC: Attack Methods for Smartcards and Similar Devices [19].
                                    Further security functionality
                                    ‚Ä¢ The TOE includes internal security measures for residual information protection.
                                    Note that the TOE does not restrict access to the functions provided by the hardware:
                                    these functions are still directly accessible to the Security IC Embedded Software.


                                      1 These crypto functions are supplied as a library rather than as a monolithic program, and hence a user of
                                          the library may include only those functions that are actually required ‚Äì it is not necessary to include all
                                          cryptographic functions of the library in every Security IC Embedded Software. For example, it is possible
                                          to omit the RSA or the ECC components. However, some dependencies exist; details are described in

2         CC Conformance and Evaluation Assurance Level
                (                    The evaluation is based upon:
                                    ‚Ä¢ "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 1: Introduction
                                      and general model, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April 2017, CCMB-2017-04-001" [1]

                                    ‚Ä¢ "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 3: Security
                                      assurance components, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April 2017, CCMB-2017-04-003" [3]
                                    For the evaluation the following methodology will be used:

                                    The chosen level of assurance is EAL6 + augmented.
                                    The augmentations to EAL6 are ASE_TSS.2 and ALC_FLR.1.
                                    This Security Target claims the following CC conformances:
                                    ‚Ä¢ CC 3.1 Part 2 extended, Part 3 conformant, EAL6 augmented
                                    ‚Ä¢ Strict Conformance to the Protection Profile [5]
                                    The assurance level for evaluation and the functionality of the TOE are chosen in order to
                                    allow the confirmation that the TOE is suitable for use within devices compliant with the
                                    German Digital Signature Law.
                                    Note 1. The hardware platform is evaluated according to the assurance level EAL 6
                                    augmented. The evaluation of the hardware platform is appropriate for the composite
                                    evaluation since both the EAL level and the augmentations claimed in this Security
                                    Target are identical to those claimed for the hardware platform (refer to the Hardware
                                    Security Target [13]).

                              2.1 Conformance claim rationale
                                    According to chapter 2 this Security Target claims strict conformance to the Protection
                                    Profile [5]. As shown in 1.3 the composed TOE consists of hardware (Secure Controller
                                    IC) and software (IC Dedicated Software). This is identical to the TOE as defined in [5]
                                    and therefore the TOE type is consistent.

3         Security Problem Definition

                              3.1 Description of Assets
                                    Since this Security Target claims strict conformance to a PP [5], the assets defined in
                                    section 3.1 of the Protection Profile apply to this Security Target. User Data and TSF
                                    data are defined as part of assets in [13]. Since the data computed by the Crypto Library
                                    contains keys, plain text and cipher text that are considered as User Data and e.g.
                                    blinding vectors that are considered as TSF data the assets are considered as complete
                                    for this Security Target.

                              3.2 Threats

                                    the Crypto Library for use by the Security IC Embedded Software:
                                    P.Add-CryptoLib-Func: Additional Specific Security Functionality
                                    The TOE provides the following additional security functionality to the Security IC
                                    Embedded Software:
                                    ‚Ä¢ RSA encryption, decryption, signature generation, signature verification, message
                                      encoding and signature encoding.

                                    Note 4. All introduced security objectives claiming cryptographic functionality are
                                    protected against attacks as described in JIL-ATT-SC: Attack Methods for Smartcards
                                    and Similar Devices [19], which include Side Channel Attacks, Perturbation attacks,
                                    Differential Fault Analysis (DFA) and timing attacks. The following exceptions apply:
                                    1. RSA Public Key computation and RSA Key generation do not contain protective
                                       measures against DPA
                                    2. ECDSA (ECC over GF(p)) Key Generation does not contain protective measures
                                       against DPA
                                    3. SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 do not contain protective
                                       measures against DPA, DFA and timing attacks. It provides countermeasures against

                                    This does not mean that the algorithm is insecure; rather at the time of this security
                                    target no promising attacks were found. More details about conditions and restrictions for
                                    resistance against attacks are given in the user documentation of the Crypto Library.

                              4.2 Security Objectives for the IC Embedded Software
                                    The security objectives for the Security IC Embedded Software defined in section 4.2 of
                                    the Protection Profile [5] and additional refinements in the Hardware Security Target [13]
                                    entirely apply to this Security Target.
                                    The TOE assumes that the Security IC Embedded Software abides by the provisions
                                    detailed in ‚ÄúClarification of Treatment of user data of the Composite TOE (OE.Resp-
                                    Appl)‚Äù contained within section 4.2 ‚ÄúSecurity Objectives for the Security IC Embedded
                                    Software‚Äù of the Hardware Security Target [13].

                              4.3 Security Objectives for the Operational Environment
                                    The security objective for the ‚ÄúSecurity Objectives for the Operational environment‚Äù
                                    defined in the PP [5], and given in the Hardware Security Target [13] are entirely valid for
                                    this Security Target.

                              4.4 Security Objectives Rationale
                                    Section 4.4 of the Protection Profile [5] and Section 4.4 of the Hardware Security Target
                                    [13] provide a rationale how the threats, organisational security policies and assumptions
                                    are addressed by the objectives that are subject of the PP. They entirely apply to this
                                    Security Target. The justification for the additional security objectives for the Crypto
                                    Library on N7021 are listed in the table below:

                                                                                          O.ECDSA
                              (                                                           O.ECC_DHKE
                                                                                          O.ECC_KeyGen
                                                                                          O.SHA

                                    They are in line with the security objectives of the Protection Profile and supplement
                                    these according to the additional assumptions and organisational security policy.
                                    The rationale for all item defined in the Security Target is given below.
                                    Since the objectives O.RSA, O.RSA_PubExp, O.RSA_KeyGen, O.ECDSA,
                                    O.ECC_DHKE, O.ECC_KeyGen and O.SHA require the TOE to implement exactly
                                    the same specific security functionality as required by P.Add-CryptoLib-Func, the
                                    organizational security policy P.Add-CryptoLib-Func is covered by the security objectives.
                                    Additionally, the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing, O.Malfunction,
                                    O.Phys-Manipulation and O.Leak-Forced define how to implement the specific security
                                    functionality required by P.Add-CryptoLib-Func and therefore support P.Add-CryptoLib-
                                    Func. These security objectives are also valid for the additional specific security
                                    functionality since they must also avert the related threats for the components added to
                                    the organisational security policy.
                                    The justification of the additional policy and the additional assumptions show that they
                                    do not contradict with the rationale already given in the Protection Profile [5] for the
                                    assumptions, policy and threats defined there.

6         Security Requirements

                              6.1 Security Functional Requirements
                                    To support a better understanding of the combination Protection Profile and Security
                                    Target of the hardware platform (N7021) vs. this Security Target (Crypto Library Cobalt
                                    on N7021 VA), the TOE SFRs are presented in the following sections.

                           6.1.1 SFRs from the Protection Profile and the Security Target of the platform
                                    The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) for this TOE (Crypto Library Cobalt on
                                    N7021 VA) are specified based on the Smart Card IC Platform Protection Profile [5], and
                                    are defined in the Common Criteria [2] or in the Protection Profile [5]. They entirely apply
                                    to this Security Target.
                                    Note 5. These requirements have already been stated in the Hardware Security Target
                                    [13] and are fulfilled by the chip hardware, if not indicated otherwise in this Section.
                                    The additional SFRs shown in this Section are defined in the Common Criteria, described
             d FCS_CKM.4 ensures that the TOE provides procedural
                                       measures to prevent disclosure of memory contents that was used by the TOE. The
                                       Crypto Library supports FDP_RIP.1[SW] and FCS_CKM.4 by making all memory
                                       contents used by the library no longer available. Note that the requirement for
                                       residual information protection applies to all functionality of the Crypto Library.

                           6.3.2 Extended requirements
                                    This Security Target does not define extended requirements.

                           6.3.3 Dependencies of security requirements
                                    SFRs [FDP_ITC.1, or FDP_ITC.2 or FCS_CKM.1] are not included in this Security Target
                                    for FCS_COP.1/SHA since the TOE only provides a pure engine for these algorithms
                                    without additional features like the handling of keys or importing data from outside the
                                    TOE. Therefore the Security IC Embedded Software must fulfil these requirements
                                    related to the needs of the realized application.

                           6.3.4 Rationale for the Assurance Requirements
                                    The selection of assurance components and augmentations of Crypto Library on N7021
                                    is generally based on EAL6, the underlying Protection Profile [5], and the Security Target
                                    of the hardware [13] of the N7021.
                                    EAL6 was chosen to provide an even stronger baseline of assurance than the EAL4 in
                                    the Protection Profile. The augmentations ALC_FLR.1 and ASE_TSS.2 were chosen to
                                    extend the level of assurance even further.

7         TOE Summary Specification
                                    This chapter describes the ‚ÄúIT Security Functionality‚Äù.

                              7.1 IT Security Functionality
                                    The evaluation of this cryptographic library is performed as a composite evaluation,
                                    where the TOE comprises both the underlying hardware and the embedded software
                                    (Crypto Library). The TOE of this composite evaluation therefore extends the security
                                    functionality already available in the chip platform (see section 7.1 ‚ÄúPortions of the TOE
                                    Security Functionality‚Äù of the Hardware Security [13]).
                                    The security functionality of N7021
                                    The security functionality of the hardware platform for the N7021 is described in the
                                    Hardware Security Target [13]. They entirely apply to this Security Target.
                                    Note 8. The security functionality SF.LOG is extended by the Crypto Library as described
                                    in Security Features of the TOE.


                                    The additional security functionality provided by the TOE is described in the following
                                    sub-sections.
                                    The IT security functionalities directly correspond to the TOE security functional
                                    requirements defined in Section 6.1. The definitions of the IT security functionalities refer
                                    to the corresponding security functional requirements.

                           7.1.1 Security Services of the TOE

                         7.1.1.1    SS.RSA

                                    The TOE provides functions that implement the RSA algorithm and the RSA-CRT
                                    algorithm for data encryption, decryption, signature and verification. All algorithms are
                                    defined in PKCS #1, v2.2 (RSAEP, RSADP, RSAP1, RSAVP1)
                                    This routine supports various key lengths from 512 bits to 4096 bits.
                                    The TOE contains modular exponentiation functions, which, together with other functions
                                    in the TOE, perform the operations required for RSA encryption or decryption. Two
                                    different RSA algorithms are supported by the TOE, namely the "Simple Straight Forward
                                    Method" (called RSA "straight forward", the key consists of the pair n and d) and RSA
                                    using the "Chinese Remainder Theorem" (RSA CRT, the key consists of the quintuple p,
                                    q, dp, dq, qInv).
                                    Attack resistance for this security functionality is discussed in Security architectural
