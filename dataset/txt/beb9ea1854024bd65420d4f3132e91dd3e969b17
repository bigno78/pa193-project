                       "TOE Overview" and "TOE Description".


                 1.1 ST Reference
                       “NXP Secure Smart Card Controller P6022y VB, Security Target Lite, NXP
                       Semiconductors, Rev. 2.1, 6 April 2018”.


                 1.2 TOE Reference
                                                                                                                      *
                       The TOE is named "NXP Secure Smart Card Controller P6022y VB including IC
                       Dedicated Software". In this document the TOE is abbreviated to NXP Secure Smart
                       Card Controller P6022y VB.


                 1.3 TOE Overview


               1.3.1 Configuration of the TOE
                       The TOE is configurable to P6022P VB which includes IC Dedicated Software,
                       configurable to P6022X VB which includes IC Dedicated Software with extended
                       memory, configurable to P6022M VB which includes IC Dedicated Software with MIFARE
                       Plus MF1PLUSx0, configurable to P6022D VB which includes IC Dedicated Software
                       with MIFARE DESFire EV1, or configurable to P6022J VB which includes IC Dedicated
                       Software with both MIFARE Plus MF1PLUSx0 and MIFARE DESFire EV1.
                       MIFARE functionality does not implement any Security Functional Requirement and its
                       functionality is therefore not in the scope of the evaluation and does not interfere with the
                       security functionality provided by the IC hardware platform.


               1.3.2   Usage and major security functionality of the P6022P VB/P6022X VB
                       The P6022P VB/P6022X VB is composed of the IC hardware platform of NXP Secure
                       Smart Card Controller P6022P VB/P6022X VB, the IC Dedicated Software, and the
                       documentation describing the Instruction Set and the usage. The P6022P VB/P6022X VB
                       is delivered with a customer specific Security IC Embedded Software.
                       The IC hardware platform of NXP Secure Smart Card Controller P6022P VB/P6022X VB
                       is a microcontroller incorporating a central processing unit, memories accessible via a
                       Memory Management Unt,c iryptographic coprocessors, other security components and
                       two communication interfaces. The central processing unit supports a 32-/24-/16-/8-bit
                       instruction set optimized for smart card applications, which is a super set of the 80C51
                       family instruction set. The first and in some cases the second byte of an instruction are
                       used for operation encoding. On-chip memories are ROM, RAM and EEPROM. The non-
                       volatile EEPROM can be used as data or program memory. It consists of high reliable
                       memory cells, which guarantee data integrity. The EEPROM is optimized for applications


                          * MIFARE emulations are not part of the TSF and do not implement any Security Functional Requirement.
                            The evaluation scope of the MIFARE emulations are limited to not interfere with the functionality provided
                            by the IC hardware platform.

                      requiring reliable non-volatile data storage for data and program code. Dedicated security
                      functionality protects the contents of all memories.
                      The IC Dedicated Software for NXP Secure Smart Card Controller P6022P VB/P6022X
                      VB comprises IC Dedicated Test Software for test purposes and IC Dedicated Support
                      Software. The IC Dedicated Support Software consists of Boot-ROM Software which
                      controls the boot process of the hardware platform and Plain Firmware Operating System
                      (FOS-Plain) which can be called by the Security IC Embedded Software. The FOS-
                      Plain provides an interface for programming of the internal EEPROM memory, which
                      is mandatory for use by the Security IC Embedded Software when programming the
                      EEPROM memory. Also, the FOS-Plain provides an interface for the Post Delivery
                      Configuration functionality.
                      The documentation includes a Product Data Sheet, an Instruction Set, a Guidance
                      and Operation Manual, two Wafer and delivery specifications (according to Fab) and
                      a Firmware Interface Specification Product data sheet addendum. This documentation
                      comprises a description of the architecture, the secure configuration and usage of the
                      IC hardware platform and the IC Dedicated Software by the Security IC Embedded
                      Software.
                      The security functionality of the P6022P VB/P6022X VB is designed to act as an integral
                      part of a complete security system in order to strengthen the design as a whole. Several
                      security mechanisms are completely implemented in and controlled by the P6022P VB/
                      P6022X VB. Other security mechanisms allow for configuration or even require handling
                      of exceptions by the Security IC Embedded Software. The different CPU modes and the
                      Memory Management Unit support the implementation of multi-application projects using
                      the P6022P VB/P6022X VB.
                      A Security IC must provide high security in particular when being used in the banking
                      and finance market, in electronic commerce or in governmental applications because
                      the P6022P VB/P6022X VB is intended to be used in a potential insecure environment.
                      Hence the P6022P VB/P6022X VB shall maintain
                      • the integrity and the confidentiality of code and data stored in its memories,
                     • the different CPU modes with the related capabilities for configuration and memory
                        access and
                      • the integrity, the correct operation and the confidentiality of security functionality
                        provided by the P6022P VB/P6022X VB.
                      This is ensured by the construction of the P6022P VB/P6022X VB and its security
                      functionality.
                      NXP Secure Smart Card Controller P6022P VB/P6022X VB basically provides a
                      hardware platform for an implementation of a smart card application with
                      • functionality to calculate the Data Encryption Standard (Triple-DES) with up to three

                 1.2 TOE Overview
                      The TOE consists of the Micro Controller and a software stack which is stored on the
                      Micro Controller and which can be executed by the Micro Controller. The software stack
                      can be further split into the following components:
                      • Firmware for booting and low level functionality of the Micro Controller (MC FW)
                        like writing to flash memory. This includes software for implementing cryptographic
                        operations, called Crypto Library.
                      • Software for implementing a Java Card Virtual Machine [15], a Java Card Runtime
                        Environment [16] and a Java Card Application Programming Interface [14], called
                        JCVM, JCRE and JCAPI.
                      • Software for implementing content management according to GlobalPlatform [17],
                        called GlobalPlatform (GP) Framework.
                      • Software for executing native libraries, called Secure Box.
                      The TOE is referred to as JCOP 4.7 SE051. The JCOP 4 Operating System (JCOP 4
                      OS) consists of the software stack without the Crypto Library (Crypto Lib) and without
                      the Micro Controller Firmware (MC FW). The TOE uses one or more communication

enable verification of the authenticity of the travel document and to identify its
holder during a border control, using an inspection system. The verification
process is based on Extended Access Control with Password Authenticated
Connection Establishment (PACE) and optionally Active Authentication (AA).

The main features and their origin are the following:
 Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
   according to ICAO Technical Report “Supplemental Access Control” [ICAO-
   9303] part 11 and strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0068-V2 [PACE-PP] for
   protection of the communication between terminal and chip. The following
   PACE mapping modes are supported and covered by the TOE:
      o    Generic Mapping (PACE-GM)
      o    Integrated Mapping (PACE-IM)
      o    Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM), which combines PACE-GM
           with Chip Authentication into a single protocol.

    according to BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1], [TR-03110-3] and
    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    travel document’s chip to the inspection system.
   Terminal Authentication v1
    according to BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1], [TR-03110-3] and
    strictly conform to BSI-CC-PP-0056-V2-2012 [EAC-PP-V2], authenticates the
    inspection system to travel document’s chip and protects the confidentiality
    and integrity of the sensitive biometric reference data during their
    transmission from the TOE to the inspection system.

As a feature that can be optionally configured the TOE supports:
   Active Authentication
    which according to [ICAO-9303] prevents copying the SOD and proves that it
    has been read from the authentic chip. It proves that the chip has not been
    substituted.


   Polymorphic Authentication
    which according to [PCA-eMRTD] provides additional privacy by randomisation
    of returned Polymorphic Identities, Polymorphic Pseudonyms and
    Complementary Polymorphic ID attributes in combination with standard ICAO
    and EAC1 eMRTD protocols specified in ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] and BSI
    TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1] and [TR 03110-3].

The TOE may also be used as an ISO driving license, compliant to ISO/IEC 18013
or ISO/IEC TR 19446 supporting PACE, AA and CA, as both applications (MRTD
and IDL) share the same protocols and data structure organization. Therefore, in
the rest of the document, the word “MRTD” MAY be understood either as a MRTD
in the sense of ICAO, or a driving license compliant to ISO/IEC 18013 or ISO/IEC
TR 19446 depending on the targeted usage envisioned by the issuer.

Application note
This TOE claims an assurance level EAL5 augmented with AVA_VAN.5 and
ALC_DVS.2. AVA_VAN.5 implies that the TOE is resistant to attacks performed by
an attacker possessing "High attack potential".
Not all key sizes specified in this security target have sufficient cryptographic
strength for satisfying the AVA_VAN.5 “high attack potential”. In order to be
protected against attackers with a "high attack potential", sufficiently large
cryptographic key sizes SHALL be configured for this TOE. References can be
found in national and international document standards. Further details have
been specified in the TOE’s guidance documentation [AGD_PRE].

These configurations are based on one or more predefined applets; different configurations might use the
same underlying applet.
The whole applet code resides in the Flash memory; the applets providing these different configurations
are instantiated into Flash memory. Multiple configurations (and hence support for different applications)
can be present at the same time by instantiating multiple applets with their distinct configurations with
some restrictions detailed below. A common combination could be an ICAO MRTD applet and an SSCD ap-
plet providing a travel application with LDS data and EAC authentication together with a signature applica-
tion.
Via configuration the instanciated applets can be tied to the contactless and/or the contact interface, re-
spectively.

1.4.2 TOE definition
The TOE is a combination of hardware and software configured to securely create, use and manage signa-
ture-creation data (SCD). The TOE consists of

provides a PKCS#15 compliant file structure and a separate DF for the SSCD functionality (D.Sig). While D.Sig
provides the TOE’s functionality claimed by this security target, the PKCS#15 part is out of scope of the
certification.

Identification of the platform is performed by the procedure according to [AGD_PRE].
Once the platform is identified correctly, the correct version of the Java card layer of the TOE (NXP eDoc
Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 - cryptovision ePasslet Suite, version 3.5) can be verified as descibed in [Guidance].

1.4.4 TOE functions
The TOE comprises all IT security functionality necessary to ensure the secrecy of the SCD and the security
of the digital signature. The TOE provides the following functions:

       to import signature creation data (SCD) and, optionally, the correspondent signature verification
        data (SVD),
       to, optionally, receive and store certificate info,
       to switch the TOE from a non-operational state to an operational state, and
       if in an operational state, to create electronic signatures for data with the following steps:
        a) select an SCD if multiple are present in the SSCD,
        b) authenticate the signatory and determine its intent to sign,
        c) receive data to be signed or a unique representation thereof (DTBS/R)
        d) apply an appropriate cryptographic signature-creation function using the selected SCD to the
           DTBS/R.
The TOE may implement its function for digital signature creation to conform to the specifications in ETSI
TS 101 733 (CAdES) [CADES], ETSI TS 101 903 (XAdES) [XADES] and ETSI TS 101 903 (PADES) [PADES].
The TOE is prepared for the signatory's use by
       import at least one set of SCD, and
       personalising for the signatory by storing in the TOE:
        a) the signatory’s reference authentication data (RAD)
        b) optionally, certificate info for at least one SCD in the TOE.
After preparation the SCD shall be in a non-operational state. Upon receiving a TOE the signatory shall verify
its non-operational state and change the SCD state to operational.

After import the SCD is in a non-operational state. Upon receiving a TOE the signatory shall verify its non-
operational state and change the SCD state to operational.

After preparation the intended legitimate user should be informed of the signatory’s verification authenti-
cation data (VAD) required for use of the TOE in signing. If the VAD is a password or PIN, the means of
providing this information is expected to protect the confidentiality and the integrity of the corresponding
RAD.

If the use of an SCD is no longer required, then it should be destroyed (e.g. by erasing it from memory) as
well as the associated certificate info, if any exists.

1.4.5 Operation of the TOE
This paragraph presents a functional overview of the TOE in its distinct operational environments:


                                                     8 of 82
NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 / SSCD with Key Import Security Target Lite


       The preparation environment, where the TOE interacts with a certification service provider (CSP)
        through a SCD/SVD generation application to import the signature creation data (SCD) and a certif-
        icate generation application (CGA) to obtain a certificate for the signature validation data (SVD)
        corresponding to the SCD the certification service provider has generated. The SCD/SVD generation
        application transmits the SVD to the CGA. The initialisation environment interacts further with the
        TOE to personalise it with the initial value of the reference authentication data (RAD).
       The signing environment where the TOE interacts with a signer through a signature creation appli-
        cation (SCA) to sign data after authenticating the signer as its signatory. The signature creation ap-
        plication provides the data to be signed (DTBS), or a unique representation thereof (DTBS/R) as
        input to the TOE signature creation function and obtains the resulting digital signature2.
       The management environments where the TOE interacts with the user or an SSCD-provisioning ser-
        vice provider to perform management operations, e.g. for the signatory to reset a blocked RAD. A
        single device, e.g. a smart card terminal, may provide the required secure environment for man-
        agement and signing.
The preparation environment, the signing environment and the management environment are secure and
protect data exchanged with the TOE. Figure 3 in prEN 14169-1:2011 illustrates the operational environ-
ment.
The TOE stores signature creation data (SCD) and reference authentication data (RAD). The TOE may store
multiple instances of SCD. In this case the TOE provides a function to identify each SCD and the SCA can
provide an interface to the signer to select an SCD for use in the signature creation function of the SSCD.
The TOE protects the confidentiality and integrity of the SCD and restricts its use in signature creation to its
signatory. The digital signature created by the TOE may be used to create an advanced electronic signature
as defined in Article 5.1 of the [Directive]3. Determining the state of the certificate as qualified is beyond
the scope of this standard.
The signature creation application is assumed to protect the integrity of the input it provides to the TOE
signature creation function as being consistent with the user data authorised for signing by the signatory.
Unless implicitly known to the TOE, the SCA indicates the kind of the signing input (as DTBS/R) it provides
and computes any hash value required. The TOE may augment the DTBS/R with signature parameters it
stores and then computes a hash value over the input as needed by the kind of input and the used crypto-
graphic algorithm.
The TOE stores signatory reference authentication data (RAD) to authenticate a user as its signatory. The
RAD is a password (e.g. PIN), a biometric template or a combination of these. The TOE protects the confi-
dentiality and integrity of the RAD. The TOE may provide a user interface to directly receive verification
authentication data (VAD) from the user, alternatively, the TOE receive the VAD from the signature creation
application (SCA). If the signature creation application handles, is requesting or obtaining a VAD from the
user, it is assumed to protect the confidentiality and integrity of this data.
A certification service provider and a SSCD-provisioning service provider interact with the TOE in the secure
preparation environment to perform any preparation function of the TOE required before control of the
TOE is given to the legitimate user. These functions may include:
       initialising the RAD,
       generating a key pair,

2 At a pure functional level the SSCD creates a digital signature; for an implementation of the SSCD, in that
meeting the requirements of this PP and with the key certificate created as specified in the Directive, Annex
I, the result of the signing process can be used as to create a qualified electronic signature.
3Please note that while this security target - following the according protection profile BSI-CC-PP-0075-
2012-MA-01 - references the [Directive], it also incorporates the requirements of the eIDAS regulation [Re-
gulation] and the according commission implementing regulation [Implementing].

1.4.2 TOE usage and security features for operational use
Depending on its configuration during pre-personalisation and personalisation,
the TOE can be used as:
    ICAO/EAC eMRTD,
    Polymorphic eMRTD and
    EU/ISO Driving Licence.

The ICAO/EAC eMRTD, Polymorphic eMRTD and Driver Licence are installed as a
separate application instances of the applet having their own dedicated
application identifiers and personalisation. The following TOE configurations are
covered within the scope of this Security Target:

BAP-1 protocol defined in ISO18013 is equal to Basic Access Protocol (BAC)
defined in [ICAO-9303]. As to the logical data structure, the ISO18013 uses the
same concept of Passive Authentication defined in [ICAO-9303], but specifies
different ISO7816-4 elementary file identifiers for storing the ICAO defined
content of DG3, DG4 and DG15.

use of TOE configured as respectively ICAO/EAC eMRTD/Driving licence and
Polymorphic eMRTD.


1.4.2.1 ICAO/EAC eMRTD and ISO Driving licence
This sub section explains the TOE security features for operational use of TOE
configured as ICAO/EAC eMRTD or as Driving Licence.

A State or Organisation issues travel documents to be used by the holder for
international travel. The traveller presents a travel document to the inspection
system to prove his or her identity. The travel document in context of this
Security Target contains:
  I.  visual (eye readable) biographical data and portrait of the holder,
 II.  a separate data summary (MRZ data) for visual and machine reading using
       OCR methods in the Machine readable zone (MRZ) and
III.  data elements on the travel document’s chip according to LDS in case of
       contactless machine reading.

The authentication of the traveller is based on:
  I.  the possession of a valid travel document personalized for a holder with
      the claimed identity as given on the biographical data page and
 II.  biometrics using the reference data stored in the travel document.

The issuing State or Organization ensures the authenticity of the data of genuine
travel documents. The receiving State trusts a genuine travel document of an
issuing State or Organization.

For this Security Target the travel document is viewed as unit of:
(i) the physical part of the travel document in form of paper and/or plastic
    and chip. It presents visual readable data including (but not limited to)
    personal data of the travel document holder
    (a) the biographical data on the biographical data page of the travel
         document surface,
    (b) the printed data in the Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) and
    (c) the printed portrait.

(ii) the logical travel document as data of the travel document holder stored
     according to the Logical Data Structure as defined in [ICAO-9303] as specified
     by ICAO on the contact based or contactless integrated circuit. It presents
     contact based / contactless readable data including(but not limited to)
     personal data of the travel document holder
     (a) the digital Machine Readable Zone Data (digital MRZ data, EF.DG1),
     (b) the digitized portraits (EF.DG2),
     (c) the biometric reference data of finger(s) (EF.DG3) or iris image(s)
          (EF.DG4) or both1,
     (d) the other data according to LDS (EF.DG5 to EF.DG16) and
     (e) the Document Security Object (SOD).


The issuing State or Organisation implements security features of the travel
document to maintain the authenticity and integrity of the travel document and
their data. The physical part of the travel document and the travel document’s
chip are identified by the Document Number.

The physical part of the travel document is protected by physical security
measures (e.g. watermark, security printing), logical (e.g. authentication keys of
the travel document’s chip) and organisational security measures (e.g. control of
materials, personalisation procedures) [ICAO-9303].These security measures can
include the binding of the travel document’s chip to the travel document.

The logical travel document is protected in authenticity and integrity by a digital
signature created by the document signer acting for the issuing State or
Organisation and the security features of the travel document’s chip.

The ICAO Doc 9303 [ICAO-9303] defines the baseline security methods Passive
Authentication, advanced security access methods Basic Access Control (BAC)
and Password Authenticated Connection Establishment to the logical travel



These biometric reference data are optional according to [ICAO-9303]. This ST assumes that the issuing State or
1

document, Active Authentication of the travel document’s chip, Extended Access
Control and the Data Encryption of sensitive biometrics as optional security
measure. The Passive Authentication Mechanism is performed completely and
independently of the TOE by the TOE environment.

The BSI TR-03110 parts 1 and 3 [TR-03110-1] and [TR 03110-3] specify the
Extended Access Control protocols Chip Authentication version 1 (CAv1) and
Terminal Authentication (TAv1), which are required to get secured access to the
biometric data stored in data groups DG3 and DG4 in combination with PACE or
BAC.

This Security Target addresses the protection of the logical travel document:
   (i) in integrity by write-only-once access control and by physical means, and
   (ii) in confidentiality by the Extended Access Control Mechanism.

This Security Target addresses the Chip Authentication Version 1 described in
[TR-03110-1] and PACE-CAM described in [ICAO-9303] part 11 as an alternative
to the Active Authentication stated in [ICAO-9303].

For Basic Access Control (BAC) supported by the product, a separate evaluation
and certification is performed with ST [ST-BAC].

The confidentiality by Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
is a mandatory security feature of the TOE. The travel document shall strictly
conform to the ‘Common Criteria Protection Profile Machine Readable Travel
Document using Standard Inspection Procedure with PACE [PACE-PP]. Note that
[PACE-PP] considers high attack potential.

For the PACE protocol according to [ICAO-9303] part 11, the following steps shall
be performed:
 (i) the travel document's chip encrypts a nonce with the shared password,
       derived from the MRZ resp. CAN data and transmits the encrypted nonce
       together with the domain parameters to the terminal.
 (ii) The terminal recovers the nonce using the shared password, by
       (physically) reading the MRZ or CAN data. This nonce shall be converted to
       a group generator using one of the following mapping algorithms, which
       maps a static generator to an ephemeral generator:
           a. Generic mapping (PACE-GM) or
           b. Integrated mapping PACE-IM)
 (iii) The travel document's chip and terminal computer perform a Diffie-
       Hellmann key agreement together with the ephemeral domain parameters
       to create a shared secret. Both parties derive the session keys KMAC and
       KENC from the shared secret.
 (iv) Each party generates an authentication token, sends it to the other party
       and verifies the received token.

In case of PACE with Chip Authenticated Mapping (PACE-CAM), in addition to the
steps above executed for the PACE-GM variant, the MRTD chip computes Chip
Authentication Data CAIC, encrypts them AIC = E(KSEnc, CAIC) and sends them

to the terminal. The terminal decrypts AIC and verifies the authenticity of the
chip using the recovered Chip Authentication Data CAIC.

After successful key negotiation, the terminal and the travel document's chip
provide private communication (secure messaging) [TR-03110-1], [ICAO-9303].

This Security Target requires the TOE to implement the Extended Access Control
as defined in [TR-03110-1]. The Extended Access Control consists of two parts:
  (i) the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1 and
  (ii) the Terminal Authentication Protocol Version 1 (v.1).

The Chip Authentication Protocol v.1
  (i) authenticates the travel document’s chip to the inspection system and
  (ii) establishes secure messaging which is used by Terminal Authentication v.1
       to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the sensitive biometric
       reference data during their transmission from the TOE to the inspection
       system. Therefore Terminal Authentication v.1 can only be performed if
       Chip Authentication v.1has been successfully executed.

The Terminal Authentication Protocolv.1 consists of
  (i) the authentication of the inspection system as entity authorized by the
       receiving State or Organisation through the issuing State, and
  (ii) an access control by the TOE to allow reading the sensitive biometric
       reference data only to successfully authenticated authorized inspection
       systems.

The Active Authentication protocol may be optionally configured during
personalisation.

The issuing State or Organisation authorizes the receiving State by means of
certification the authentication public keys of Document Verifiers who create
Inspection System Certificates.


1.4.2.2 Polymorphic eMRTD

In addition to an ICAO/EAC eMRTD functionality, the TOE supports Polymorphic
eMRTD extensions that can be configured using the same applet during
personalisation. The TOE’s Polymorphic eMRTD extensions enable secure
authentication with enhanced privacy protection features. The Polymorphic
extensions provide the holder the possibility to authenticate towards a service
provider using an authentication service in a non-traceable and non-linkable
manner thanks to usage of Polymorphic ID attributes.

The Polymorphic extensions are used to configure a Polymorphic eMRTD as stand
alone application instance or next to an ICAO/EAC eMRTD/Driving application
licence instance having its own application identifier during personalisation.

                        eMRTD Configuration)

The Polymorphic eMRTD uses the same ICAO and EAC1 protocols like PACEv2,
Chip Authentication v1 (CAv1) and Terminal Authentication (v1) as defined in
[ICAO-9303], [TR-03110-1] and [TR-03110-3]. The TOE’s Polymorphic eMRTD
extensions provide the following features:

      Secure storage of the Polymorphic ID attributes during personalisation or
       the TOE.
      Polymorphic Authentication Protocol (PMA) for authenticated access with
       user consent, randomization and secure readout of the Polymorphic ID
       attributes, in combination with PACEv2 and EAC1 eMRTD protocols.
      PACEv2 protocol extended with PIN and PUK passwords, to enforce user
       authentication (document holder verification) in compliance with [TR-
       03101-3].

For Polymorphic eMRTD, the PACE protocol is configured with PIN, PUK and CAN
passwords in compliance with [TR-03110-3] during personalisation. Only PACE-
GM and PACE-IM are configurable for a Polymorphic eMRTD.

The Active Authentication protocol shall not be configured for a polymorphic
eMRTD.

The logical data structure consists only of EF.CVCA, DG14 and EF.SOD. In order
to assure a sufficient level of privacy during authentication the CAv1 private key
and EF.SOD are shared amoung a sufficient high number of personalised
Polymorphic eMRTDs, i.e. the logical data structure does not contain any unique
identifiable data.



1.4.3 TOE life cycle
The TOE life cycle is described in terms of its four life cycle phases. (With respect
to the [SIC-PP], the TOE life-cycle is additionally subdivided into 7 steps in the
ST. These steps are denoted too in the following although the sequence of the
steps differs for the TOE life cycle).

1.4.3.1 Phase 1 “Development”
(Step1) The TOE is developed in phase 1. The IC developer develops the
integrated circuit, the IC Dedicated Software and the guidance documentation
associated with these TOE components.
The IC developer also acts as the developer of the embedded software (operating
system), which is the NXP JCOP 3 P60.

(Step2) The software developer uses the guidance documentation for the
integrated circuit and the guidance documentation for relevant parts of the NXP
JCOP 3 P60 and develops the ePassport application and the guidance
documentation associated with this TOE component.

The ePassport application (i.e. the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
(SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet run time code) may be
integrated either in ROM or in EEPROM of the chip. Depending on the intention:
      (a) the ePassport application is securely delivered directly from the
          software developer (IDEMIA development dept.) to the IC manufacturer
          (NXP). The applet code will be integrated into the ROM mask code or
          inEEPROM by the IC manufacturer, or
      (b) the ePassport application is securely delivered directly from the
          software developer (IDEMIA development dept.) to the travel document
          manufacturer (IDEMIA production dept.) .) for loading in EEPROM.

Notice that the guidance documentation of the ePassport application is always
securely delivered directly from the software developer (IDEMIA development
dept.) to the travel document manufacturer (IDEMIA production dept.).


1.4.3.2 Phase 2 “Manufacturing”
(Step3) In a first step the TOE integrated circuit is produced containing the travel
document’s chip Dedicated Software, the parts of the travel document’s chip
Embedded Software and in case of alternative a) the ePassport application in
ROM or in EEPROM.

The IC manufacturer writes the IC Identification Data onto the chip to control the
IC as travel document material during the IC manufacturing and the delivery
process to the travel document manufacturer. The IC is securely delivered from
the IC manufacturer to the travel document manufacturer.

If necessary the IC manufacturer adds the parts of the IC Embedded Software in
the non-volatile programmable memories (for instance EEPROM).

(Step4 optional) The travel document manufacturer combines the IC with
hardware for the contact based / contactless interface in the travel document
unless the travel document consist of the chip only.

(Step5) The travel document manufacturer
  i.  adds the IC Embedded Software or part of it in the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM) if necessary and in case
      of alternative (b), loads the ePassport application into the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM),
 ii.      creates the ePassport application and
iii.      equips travel document’s chips with pre-personalization Data.

life-cycle management functions required for TOE preparation. TOE preparation
steps are performed in manufacturing phase and consist of the following 2
activities:
    1. Platform initialisation
       2. Pre-personalisation

Platform initialisation
Platform initialisation consists of the configuration of the NXP JCOP 3 P60 in
accordance with requirements specified in the platform administrator guidance
[PLTF-PRE] by using the dedicated platform commands. Furthermore the Pre-
Personalisation Agent key set is installed and (a part of) the CPLC data is
updated. To prevent unattended tracing of the MRTD document, the NXP JCOP 3
P60 is configured such that unauthenticated access to any platform unique
idenfiable data is not possible.

                              eMRTD Configuration)

Pre-personalisation
The pre-personalisation consists of the following steps:
   a. IC (chip) Authentication and getting chip access with the pre-
      personalisation key set.
   b. [optional] In case the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
      (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet runtime code does
      not reside in ROM, it is loaded into EEPROM.
   c. Install the applet application instances depending on the desired TOE
      configuration specified in section 1.4.2, using IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with
      Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet.
   d. Set the ePassport (and if present) the Polymorphic eMRTD applet
      irreversibly in its PERSONALISATION life-cycle state by installation of the
      Personalisation Agent specific personalisation key set(s).

During step (c) the CPLC data with the IC Identifier as well as the other pre-
personalisation data is configured in the TOE. The last step (d) finalizes the TOE.
This is the moment the TOE starts to exist and is ready for delivery to the
Personalisation Agent. The guidance documentation for the Personalisation Agent
is [AGD_PRE].

The pre-personalised travel document together with the IC Identifier is securely
delivered from the travel document manufacturer to the Personalisation Agent.
The travel document manufacturer also provides the relevant parts of the
guidance documentation [AGD_PRE] and [AGD_OPE] and the Personalisation
Agent Key set to the Personalisation Agent. The following table describes the
physical delivery of the TOE components:

1.4.3.3 Phase 3 “Personalisation of the travel document”
(Step 6) The personalisation of the travel document includes
  i.  the survey of the MRTD holder’s biographical data,
 ii.   the enrolment of the MRTD holder biometric reference data (i.e. the
       digitized portraits and the optional biometric reference data),
iii.   the printing of the visual readable data onto the physical MRTD,
iv.    the writing of the TOE User Data and TSF Data into the logical MRTD and
 v.    configuration of the TSF if necessary.

The step (iv) is performed by the Personalisation Agent and includes but is not
limited to the creation of:
  i.   the digital MRZ data (EF.DG1),
 ii.   the digitized portrait (EF.DG2), and
iii.   the Document security object.

The signing of the Document security object by the Document signer [ICAO-
9303] finalizes the personalisation of the genuine travel document for the travel
document holder. The personalised travel document (together with appropriate
guidance (AGD_OPE) for TOE usage if necessary) is handed over to the travel
document holder for operational use.

The personalisation of Polymorphic eMRTD application instance includes:

 i.    establishing the identity of the polymorphic eMRTD document holder,
 ii.   Requesting the required Polymorphic eMRTD ID attributes from the central
       Key Management authority,
iii.   writing Polymorphic ID attributes, Polymorphic LDS data as defined in
       [PCA-eMRTD],
iv.    writing the TSF data (PIN, PUK, CAv1 private key) as defined in [PCA-
       eMRTD],
 v.    signing the Document Security Object defined in
       [ICAO-9303] (in the role of DS).


The signing of the Document security object by the Document signer [ICAO-
9303] finalizes the personalisation of the genuine Polymorphic eMRTD document
for the travel document holder. The personalised Polymorphic eMRTD document
(together with appropriate guidance (AGD_OPE) for TOE usage if necessary) is
handed over to the Polymorphic eMRTD document holder for operational use.

Private Key.

EAC PP Application note 3: This ST distinguishes between the Personalisation
Agent as entity known to the TOE and the Document Signer as entity in the TOE
IT environment signing the Document security object as described in [ICAO-
9303]. This approach allows but does not enforce the separation of these roles.


1.4.3.4 Phase 4 “Operational Use”
(Step 7) The TOE is used as a travel document's chip by the traveller and the
inspection systems in the “Operational Use” phase. The user data can be read
according to the security policy of the issuing State or Organisation and can be
used according to the security policy of the issuing State but they can never be
modified.

EAC PP Application note 42: The intention of the ST is to consider at least the
phases 1 and parts of phase 2 (i.e. Step1 to Step3) as part of the evaluation and
therefore to define the TOE delivery according to CC after this phase. Since
specific production steps of phase 2 are of minor security relevance (e.g. booklet
manufacturing and antenna integration) these are not part of the CC evaluation
under ALC. Nevertheless the decision about this has to be taken by the
certification body resp. the national body of the issuing State or Organisation. In
this case the national body of the issuing State or Organisation is responsible for
these specific production steps.
Note that the personalisation process and its environment may depend on
specific security needs of an issuing State or Organisation. All production,
generation and installation procedures after TOE delivery up to the “Operational
Use” (phase 4) have to be considered in the product evaluation process under
AGD assurance class. Therefore, the Security Target outlines the split up of
P.Manufact, P.Personalisation and the related security objectives into aspects
relevant before vs. after TOE delivery.


1.4.3.5 Non-TOE hardware/software/firmware required by the TOE
There is no explicit non-TOE hardware, software or firmware required by the TOE
to perform its claimed security features. The TOE is defined to comprise the chip
and the complete operating system and application. Note, the inlay holding the
chip as well as the antenna and the booklet (holding the printed MRZ) are
needed to represent a complete travel document. Nevertheless, these parts are
not inevitable for the secure operation of the TOE.




2
 For this ST all steps of both phase 1 and phase 2 are part of the evaluation and therefore define the TOE
delivery according to the CC evaluation after this phase.

2.3 Package Claim
This ST is conforming to assurance package EAL5 augmented with ALC_DVS.2
and AVA_VAN.5 defined in CC part 3 [CC-3].


2.4 PP Conformance Rationale
This ST claims strict conformance to [EAC-PP-V2]. According to hints in [EAC-PP-
V2] parts of the [PACE-PP] have been included into this ST. A detailed
justification is given in the following.


2.4.1 Main aspects
-   The TOE description (chapter 1.3) is based on the TOE definition and TOE
    usage of [EAC-PP, 1.1]. It was enhanced by product specific details.

-   All definitions of the security problem definition in [EAC-PP, 3] have been
    taken exactly from the protection profile in the same wording.

-   All security objectives have been taken exactly from [EAC-PP, 4] in the same
    wording, except for OT.Chip_Auth_Proof which is enhanced to support
    Active Authentication.

-   The part of extended components definition has been taken originally from
    [EAC-PP, 5].

-   All SFRs for the TOE have been taken originally from the [EAC-PP, 6.1] added
    by according iterations, selections and assignments.

-   The security assurance requirements (SARs) have been taken originally from
    the EAC-PP. The requirements are shifted to those of EAL 5+.


2.4.2 Overview of differences between the PP and the ST

The Active Authentication has been added to the TOE. For that:
- One assumption has been added to cover Active Authentication during
   personalization: A.Pers_Agent_AA
- Two security objectives for the environment have been added:
   OE.Auth_Key_MRTD and OE.AA_MRTD. These additions to the original
   objectives of the PP do not contradict with any other objective nor mitigate a
   threat (or part of a threat) meant to be addressed by security objectives for
   the TOE in the PP.
- Three security functional requirements have been added:
              FCS_COP.1/SIG_GEN
                FIA_API.1/AA
                FMT_MTD.1/AAPK

                  IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy
                                                                2018_2000036361

                                                                  Page: 26/150
                        eMRTD Configuration)

The additional functionality of Password Authenticated Connection Establishment
with Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM) has been added to the TOE. It
possesses the same security requirements as the PACE functionality, which
means that the same security problem definition is applicable for PACE-CAM.


The following additional SFRs have been defined for PACE-CAM:
              FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM
                FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM
                FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM
                FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM
                FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM
                FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ
                FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_WRITE




The additional functionality of the Polymorphic eMRTD extensions has been
added to the TOE with: (i) additional security problem definition; (ii) additional
security objectives; (iii) additional SFRs. Notice that many SFRs are included
from the [EACv2-PP].

                           eneral support for cryptographic operations needed.

OT.Data_Authenticity The security objective OT.Data_Authenticity aims
  ensuring authenticity of the User- and TSF data (after the PACE
  Authentication) by enabling its verification at the terminal-side and by an
  active verification by the TOE itself. This objective is mainly achieved by
  FTP_ITC.1/PACE using FCS_COP.1/PACE_MAC. A prerequisite for establishing

  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM, FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM and FCS_CKM.4 for PACE
  CAM) represent some required specific properties of the protocols used. The
  SFR FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords, the
  Chip Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication Private Key. The
  SFR FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE
  passwords and the modular invert of the CA key. FMT_MTD.1/PA requires that
  SOD containing signature over the User Data stored on the TOE and used for
  the Passive Authentication is allowed to be written by the Personalisation
  Agent only and, hence, is to be considered as trustworthy. The SFR
  FCS_RND.1 represents a general support for cryptographic operations needed.
  The SFRs FMT_SMF.1 and FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles
  related.

OT.Data_Confidentiality The security objective OT.Data_Confidentiality aims
  that the TOE always ensures confidentiality of the User- and TSF-data stored
  and, after the PACE Authentication resp. Chip Authentication, of these data
  exchanged. This objective for the data stored is mainly achieved by

  This objective for the data exchanged is mainly achieved by FDP_UCT.1/TRM,
  FDP_UIT.1/TRM and FTP_ITC.1/PACE using FCS_COP.1/PACE_ENC resp.
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC. A prerequisite for establishing this trusted channel is a
  successful PACE or Chip and Terminal Authentication v.1 FIA_UID.1/PACE,
  FIA_UAU.1/PACE (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM, FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE
  CAM) using FCS_CKM.1/DH_PACE resp. FCS_CKM.1/CA and possessing the
  special properties FIA_UAU.5/PACE, FIA_UAU.6/PACE (FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM,
  FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) resp. FIA_UAU.6/EAC. FDP_RIP.1
  requires erasing the values of session keys (here: for Kenc). The SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords, the Chip
  Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication Private Key. The SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ restricts the access to the PACE passwords
  and the modular invert of the CA key. FMT_MTD.1/PA requires that SOD
  containing signature over the User Data stored on the TOE and used for the
  Passive Authentication is allowed to be written by the Personalisation Agent
  only and, hence, is to be considered trustworthy. The SFR FCS_RND.1
  represents the general support for cryptographic operations needed. The SFRs
  FMT_SMF.1 and FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related.

OT.Tracing The security objective OT.Tracing aims that the TOE prevents
  gathering TOE tracing data by means of unambiguous identifying the travel
  document remotely through establishing or listening to a communication via
  the contactless/contact-based interface of the TOE without a priori knowledge
  of the correct values of shared passwords (CAN, MRZ, PIN, PUK). This
  objective is achieved as follows:
            1. While establishing PACE communication with CAN, MRZ or PUK
                (non-blocking      authentication /   authorization  data)   by
                FIA_AFL.1/PACE,
            2. while establishing PACE communication using the PIN (blocking
                authentication data) by FIA_AFL.1/Block_PIN,
            3. for listening to PACE communication and for establishing CAv1
                communication by FTP_ITC.1/PACE,
            4. and      for     listening     to  CAv1     communication     by
                FTP_ITC.1/Polymorphic. The trusted channel shall be established
                by performing the PACE, CAv1 and TAv1 protocols according to
                [TR03110TR-03110] and the Polymorphic Authentication protocol
                (PMA).

OT.Prot_Abuse-Func The security objective OT.Prot_Abuse-Func “Protection
  against Abuse of Functionality” is ensured by the SFRs FMT_LIM.1, FMT_LIM.2,
  FMT_LIM.1/POLY and FMT_LIM.2/POLY which prevent misuse of test
  functionality of the TOE or other features which may not be used after TOE
  Delivery.

OT.Prot_Inf_Leak The security objective OT.Prot_Inf_Leak “Protection against
  Information Leakage” requires the TOE to protect confidential TSF data stored
  and/or processed in the travel document’s chip against disclosure
      by measurement and analysis of the shape and amplitude of signals or the
        time between events found by measuring signals on the electromagnetic
        field, power consumption, clock, or I/O lines which is addressed by the
        SFR FPT_EMS.1,
      by forcing a malfunction of the TOE which is addressed by the SFR
        FPT_FLS.1 and FPT_TST.1, and/or
      by a physical manipulation of the TOE which is addressed by the SFR
        FPT_PHP.3.

OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper The security objective OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper “Protection
  against Physical Tampering” is covered by the SFR FPT_PHP.3.

OT.Prot_Malfunction The security objective OT.Prot_Malfunction “Protection
  against Malfunctions” is covered by (i) the SFR FPT_TST.1 which requires self-
  tests to demonstrate the correct operation and tests of authorized users to
  verify the integrity of TSF data and TSF code, and (ii) the SFRFPT_FLS.1 which
  requires a secure state in case of detected failure or operating conditions
  possibly causing a malfunction.

OT.Identification The security objective OT.Identification “Identification of the
  TOE” addresses the storage of Initialisation and Pre-Personalisation Data in its
  non-volatile memory, whereby they also include the IC Identification Data
  uniquely identifying the TOE’s chip. This will be ensured by TSF according to
  SFR FAU_SAS.1. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA allows only the Manufacturer
  to write Initialisation and Pre-personalisation Data (including the
  Personalisation Agent key set). The SFR FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS requires the
  Personalisation Agent to disable access to Initialisation and Pre-personalisation
  Data in the life cycle phase ‘operational use’. The SFRs FMT_SMF.1 and
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related.

OT.AC_Pers The       security   objective  OT.AC_Pers      “Access   Control   for
  Personalisation of logical travel document” addresses the access control of the
  writing the logical travel document. The justification for the SFRs FAU_SAS.1,
  FMT_MTD.1/INI_ENA and FMT_MTD.1/INI_DIS arises from the justification for
  OT.Identification above with respect to the Pre-personalisation Data. The write
  access to the logical travel document data are defined by the SFR
  FIA_UID.1/PACE (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM), FIA_UAU.1/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM), FDP_ACC.1/TRM and FDP_ACF.1/TRM
  in the same way: only the successfully authenticated Personalisation Agent is
  allowed to write the data of the groups EF.DG1 to EF.DG16 of the logical travel
  document only once. FMT_MTD.1/PA covers the related property of
  OT.AC_Pers (writing SOD and, in generally, personalization data). The SFR
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE lists the roles (including Personalisation Agent) and the SFR
  FMT_SMF.1 lists the TSF management functions (including Personalisation).

  The SFRs FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ (FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ for
  PACE CAM protocol) and FPT_EMS.1 restrict the access to the Personalisation
  Agent Keys, the Chip Authentication Private Key and the Active Authentication
  Private key. The authentication of the terminal as Personalisation Agent shall
  be performed by TSF according to SFRs FIA_UAU.4/PACE and FIA_UAU.5/PACE
  (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM and FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). If the
  Personalisation Terminal wants to authenticate itself to the TOE by means of
  the Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 (after Chip Authentication v.1) with
  the Personalisation Agent Keys, the TOE will use TSF according to the
  FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the challenge), FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the
  derivation of the new session keys after Chip Authentication v.1), and
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC (for the ENC_MAC_Mode secure
  messaging), FCS_COP.1/SIG_VER (as part of the Terminal Authentication
  Protocol v.1) and FIA_UAU.6/EAC (for the re-authentication). If the
  Personalisation Terminal wants to authenticate itself to the TOE by means of
  the Authentication Mechanism with the Personalisation Agent Key, the TOE will
  use TSF according to the FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the challenge) and
  FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC (to verify the authentication attempt). The session keys
  are destroyed according to FCS_CKM.4 after use.

OT.Sens_Data_Conf The            security     objective      OT.Sense_Data_Conf“
  Confidentiality of sensitive biometric reference data” is enforced by the Access
  Control SFP defined in FDP_ACC.1/TRM and FDP_ACF.1/TRM allowing the data
  of EF.DG3 and EF.DG4 only to be read by successfully authenticated Extended
  Inspection System being authorized by a valid certificate according
  FCS_COP.1/SIG_VER. The SFRs FIA_UID.1/PACE and FIA_UAU.1/PACE
  (FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM and FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM) require the
  identification and authentication of the inspection systems. The SFR
  FIA_UAU.5/PACE requires the successful Chip Authentication (CA) v.1 before
  any     authentication    attempt   as    Extended     Inspection  System    (or
  FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). During the protected communication
  following the CA v.1 the reuse of authentication data is prevented by
  FIA_UAU.4/PACE (FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM for PACE CAM). The SFR
  FIA_UAU.6/EAC and FDP_UCT.1/TRM requires the confidentiality protection of
  the transmitted data after Chip Authentication v.1 by means of secure
  messaging implemented by the cryptographic functions according to
  FCS_RND.1 (for the generation of the terminal authentication challenge),
  FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the generation of shared secret and for the derivation of
  the new session keys), and FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC for
  the ENC_MAC_Mode secure messaging. The session keys are destroyed
  according to FCS_CKM.4 after use. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/CAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ requires that the Chip Authentication Key cannot be
  written unauthorized or read afterwards. The SFR FMT_MTD.1/AAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ requires that the Active Authentication Key cannot be
  written       unauthorized       or      read      afterwards.      The     SFR
  FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_WRITE and FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_READ

  or read afterwards. To allow a verification of the certificate chain as in

OT.Chip_Auth_Proof The security objective OT.Chip_Auth_Proof “Proof of
  travel document’s chip authenticity” is ensured by the Chip Authentication
  Protocolv.1 provided by FIA_API.1/CA and by Active Authentication provided
  by FIA_API.1/AA proving the identity of the TOE. The Chip Authentication
  Protocolv.1 defined by FCS_CKM.1/CA is performed using a TOE internally
  stored confidential private key as required by FMT_MTD.1/CAPK and
  FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ. The Chip Authentication Protocolv.1 [TR-03110-1]
  requires additional TSF according to FCS_CKM.1/CA (for the derivation of the
  session keys), FCS_COP.1/CA_ENC and FCS_COP.1/CA_MAC (for the
  ENC_MAC_Mode        secure    messaging).    The   SFRs     FMT_SMF.1     and
  FMT_SMR.1/PACE support the functions and roles related. The Active
  Authentication defined by FCS_COP.1/SIG_GEN for the generation of the RSA
  Signature is performed using a TOE internally stored confidential private key
  as required by FMT_MTD.1/AAPK and FMT_MTD.1/KEY_READ. According to
  FDP_ACF.1, only the successfully authenticated Inspection Systems are
  allowed to request active authentication (FDP_ACF.1.2, rule 2).

6.3.3.1.1 Rationale for the exclusion of Dependencies


The dependency FMT_MSA.3 of FDP_ACF.1/TRM is discarded. The access
  control TSF according to FDP_ACF.1/TRM uses security attributes which are
  defined during the personalisation and are fixed over the whole life time of the
  TOE. No management of these security attribute (i.e. SFR FMT_MSA.1 and
  FMT_MSA.3) is necessary here.

6.3.4 Rationale for the Security Assurance Requirements
The EAL5 was chosen to permits a developer to gain maximum assurance from
positive security engineering based upon rigorous commercial development
practices supported by moderate application of specialist security engineering
techniques. Such a TOE will probably be designed and developed with the intent
of achieving EAL5 assurance. It is likely that the additional costs attributable to
the EAL5 requirements, relative to rigorous development without the application
of specialised techniques, will not be large.

6.3.5 AVA_VAN.5 Advanced methodical vulnerability analysis
The selection of the component AVA_VAN.5 provides the assurance that the TOE
is shown to be highly resistant to penetration attacks to meet the security
objectives OT.Prot_Inf_Leak, OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper and OT.Prot_Malfunction.

6.3.6 ALC_DVS.2 Sufficiency of security measures
The selection of the component ALC_DVS.2 provides a higonic ID document. In this case a smart-card terminal
may be deployed that provides the required secure environment to handle a request for signatory authori-
zation. A signature can be obtained on a document prepared by a signature-creation application component
running on personal computer connected to the card terminal. The signature creation application, after
presenting the document to the user and after obtaining the authorization PIN initiates the electronic sig-
nature creation function of the smart card through the terminal.
The RAD verification is typically performed by direct PIN verification (VERIFY PIN command); to further pro-
tect the RAD (password or PIN) – especially in a contactless application scenario – the Password Authenti-
cated Connection Establishmanet (PACE) protocol according to [TR03110] can be used.

1.4.6 Major security features of the TOE
The TOE provides the following TOE security functionalities:
         TSF_Access manages the access to objects (files, directories, data and secrets) stored in the applet’s
          file system. It also controls write access of initialization, pre-personalization and personalization
          data4.
         TSF_Admin manages the storage of manufacturing data, pre-personalization data and personaliza-
          tion data.
         TSF_Secret ensures secure management of secrets such as cryptographic keys. This covers secure
          key storage, access to keys as well as secure her assurance of the
secu-rity of the MRTD's development and manufacturing especially for the secure
handling of the MRTD's material.

                       eMRTD Configuration)

7.1.2 SF.CF Cryptographic functions support
Cryptographic function support is provided by the underlying NXP JCOP 3 P60,
i.e. the TOE relies on the underlying platform for performing its required
cryptographic operations.

SF.CF Cryptographic functions include:
        SF.CF.1: 3DES and AES cipher operations for secure messaging
        SF.CF.2: Digest calculations (SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and
         SHA-512)
        SF.CF.3: Signature generation (ECDSA, RSA)
        SF.CF.4: Signature verification (ECDSA, RSA)
        SF.CF.5: Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement (ECDH and DH)
        SF.CF.6: Key Generation (PACE ECDH/DH ephemeral keys and secure
         messaging MAC and ENC session keys)
        SF.CF.7: Key and secret authentication data Destruction
        SF.CF.8: True Random Number generation
        SF.CF.9: Randomization of PI/PP/CPI data as part of the Polymorphic
         Authentication protocol (PMA)




7.1.3 SF.ILTB Protection against interference, logical tampering
and bypass

SF.ILTB.1
  Protection against interference, logical tampering and bypass
  Security domains are supported by the Java Card platform used by the TOE
  underlying NXP JCOP 3 P60. The NXP JCOP 3 P60 provides protection against
  physical attack and performs self-tests as described in [PLTF-ST].
  The platform protects the TOE against malfunctions that are caused by
  exposure to operating conditions that may cause a malfunction. This includes
  hardware resets and operation outside the specified norms.
  The IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic
  eMRTD Configuration) Applet uses transient memory where a hardware reset
  always reverts the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
  (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet into an unauthenticated
  state.

7.1.4 SF.AC Access control / Storage and protection of logical
travel document data

SF.AC.1
  Access control / Storage and protection of logical travel document
  data
  The TOE provided access control, storage and protection of logical travel
  document data including access control to MRTD data. The TOE implements
  the subjects, objects, security attributes and rules according to the security
  attribute based access control. Access control is enforced by the APDU
  methods as specified in the interface defined in the functional specification.

7.1.5 SF.SM Secure Messaging

SF.SM.1
  Secure Messaging
  Secure messaging MAC and ENC operations are performed by the TOE’s
  platform.
  Secure messaging in ENC_MAC mode is established during PACE or re-
  established during Chip Authentication v1 and is based on SF.CF.1, 5, 6 and 8.

SF.SM.2
  Secure Messaging – Re-authentication
  The Retail MAC for 3DES and CMAC for AES are part of every APDU
  command/response when secure messaging is active after a successful PACE
  or Chip Authentication has been accomplished. Re-authentication after reset of
  the SM protocol is assured by accepting only valid (mandatory) MAC or CMAC
  cryptograms.

7.1.6 SF.LCM Security and life cycle management

SF.LCM.1
  Management of phases and roles
  For the TOE the following life-cycle phases have been identified:
      1. Manufacturing phase
      2. Personalisation phase
      3. Operational phase
      4. Termination phase
  Each life-cycle phase (or state) has its typical user acting as role holder.

                           Polymorphic eMRTD document holder
Terminated phase           None

  All role holders in Manufacturing, Pre-Personalisation and Personalisation
  phases are identified by cryptographic authentication keys. In Operational
  phase the PACE password is required to authenticate the Basic or Extended
  Inspection System in order to get access to the non-sensitive ICAO LDS
  datagroups.
  The IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic
  eMRTD Configuration) Applet maintains the internal life-cycle state the
  moment that the applet is installed. This state, together with the access
  control mechanisms force the Terminal into a specific role, for the pre-
  personalisation and subsequent, personalisation and operational phases. The
  phases (and corresponding life-cycle states) are controlled by APDU
  commands.



SF.LCM.2
  Life Cycle states of the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
  (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet
  The TOE supports the following life-cycle states:
      1. Not instantiated (applet resides in ROM or in EEPROM)
      2. PRE-PERSONALISATION state
      3. PERSONALISATION state
      4. OPERATIONAL state
      5. TERMINATED state (irreversibly)
  Each life-cycle phase (or state) has its typical user acting as role holder.

  It assumed that:
      o All authentication infrastructure keys used by the central Key
          Management       Authority     for   the    polymorphic    authentication
          infrastructure (generation and transformation of PP, PI and CPI) are
          generated, handled and stored securely.
      o The PP/PI/CPI are generated securely by the central Key Management
          Authority of the polymorphic authentication infrastructure and stored
          securely in the eMRTD polymorphic chip during the personalization
          phase.
      o The TOE communicates only with Trustworthy Authentication
          Service/Terminal during the Polymorphic Authentication.
      o The randomised PP, PI and CPI are securely received by Polymorphic
          Authentication Service/Terminal. The randomised PP, PI and CPI are
          transformed (“re-keyed”) by the central Key Management Authority
          (i.e. ElGamal re-encryption of the randomized PP, PI and/or CPI using
          the public key of Servicez Provider, who has is authorized to read the
          plain value of identifying user attributes included in the PP, PI or CPI).
          Identification by the identifying user attributes contained inside the PP,
          PI and CPI takes place at the Service Provider.
  Application Note:
  This Assumption has been added to this ST for the polymorphic authentication
  infrastructure. This addition does not conflict with the strict conformance to
  PACE PP [PACE-PP] and EACv1 PP [EAC-PP-V2].

A.Auth_PKI_Polymorphic
  PKI for Polymorphic eMRTD It is assumed that:
     o The issuing States or Organisations establish a dedicated CVCA, DVCA
        and IS PKI for the polymorphic eMRTD infrastructure.
     o The Country Verifying Certification Authorities, the Document Verifier
        and Extended Inspection Systems hold authentication key pairs and
        certificates for their public keys encoding the access control rights for
        access to the PP, PI and (optional) CPI polymorphic user data. The
        Country Verifying Certification Authorities of the issuing States or
        Organisations are signing the certificates of the Document Verifier and
        the Document Verifiers are signing the certificates of the Polymorphic
        Authentication     Terminal/Service   of   the   receiving   States    or

         keys of their Country Verifying Certification Authority to their
         Polymorphic eMRTD document's chip.
      o The issuing State or Organisation establishs the necessary public key
         infrastructure in order to limit the access to Polymorphic data of
         Polymorphic eMRTD document holders to authorized Organisations. The
         Country Verifying Certification Authority of the issuing State or
         Organisation generates card verifiable Document Verifier Certificates
         for the authorized Document Verifier only.
      o The issuing State or Organisation establishs the necessary public key
         infrastructure in order to (i) generate the Polymorphic eMRTD
         document's Chip Authentication Key Pair, (ii) sign and store the Chip
         Authentication Public Key in the Chip Authentication Public Key data
         and (iii) support Polymorphic Authentication Terminals/Services to
         verify the authenticity of the Polymorphic eMRTD document's chip
         according to [TR-03110] used for genuine Polymorphic eMRTD
         document by certification of the Chip Authentication Public Key by
         means of the Document Security Object.
      o The Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer establishes a public key
         infrastructure for the card verifiable certificates used for Terminal
         Authentication. For this aim, the Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer
         shall run a Country Verifying Certification Authority. The PKI shall fulfill
         the requirements and rules of the corresponding certificate policy. The
         Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer shall make the CVCA certificate
         available to the personalization agent or the manufacturer.
      o The polymorphic eMRTD document Issuer issues the polymorphic
         eMRTD document and approves it using the terminals and
         authentication services complying with all applicable laws and
         regulations.
  Application Note:
  This Assumption is an extension of the Assumption 'A.Auth_PKI' defined in
  [EAC-PP-V2]. For the EAC functionality of the TOE the assumption is necessary
  because it covers the pre-requisite for performing the Terminal Authentication
  Protocol Version 1.

A.Insp_Sys_Polymorphic

Polymorphic Inspection Systems and authentication services
     o Polymorphic    Inspection     Systems   (Polymorphic     Authentication
       Terminals/Services) ensure the confidentiality, Privacy, Authenticity
       and integrity of the polymorphic data read from the polymorphic
       eMRTD document (e.g. PACE PIN/PUK, integrity of PKI certificates,
       randomized PI, PP and optional CPI data, etc.), where it is necessary
       for a secure operation of the TOE.
     o Polymorphic Inspection Systems will prevent eavesdropping to their
       communication with the TOE before secure messaging is successfully
       established based on the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1.

                    eMRTD Configuration)

   o   Polymorphic Inspection Systems examine the polymorphic eMRTD
       document presented by the polymorphic eMRTD document holder to
       verify its authenticity by means of the physical security measures and
       to detect any manipulation of the physical part of the polymorphic
       eMRTD document.
    o Polymorphic Inspection Systems include the Country Signing CA Public
       Key and implement the respective terminal part of the protocols
       required to execute PACE with PIN, Passive Authentication (PA), CAv1,
       TAv1 authentication according to [TR-03110-2] and Polymorphic
       Authentication (PMA). They are assumed to securely store static IS
       private keys and generate secure temporary session keys and nonces.
    o The Document Verifier authorizes Polymorphic Inspection Systems by
       creation of Inspection System Certificates for access to polymorphic
       user data stored the polymorphic eMRTD document. An Polymorphic
       Inspection Systems authenticates itselve to the polymorphic eMRTD
       document's chip for getting access to the polymorphic data with its
       private Terminal Authentication key and corresponding Inspection
       System Certificate.
Application Note:
This Assumption is an extension of the Assumption 'A.Insp_Sys' defined in
[EAC-PP-V2]. For the EAC functionality of the TOE the assumption is necessary
because it covers the pre-requisite for performing the PACE with PIN, CAv1
and TAv1 authentication.

4 Security Objectives

This chapter describes the security objectives for the TOE and the security
objectives for the TOE environment. The security objectives for the TOE
environment are separated into security objectives for the development and
production environment and security objectives for the operational environment.


4.1 Security Objectives for the TOE
This section describes the security objectives for the TOE addressing the aspects
of identified threats to be countered by the TOE and organizational security
policies to be met by the TOE.

4.1.1 Security Objectives listed in PP PACE

OT.Data_Integrity
  Integrity of Data
  The TOE must ensure integrity of the User Data and the TSF-data stored on it
  by protecting these data against unauthorised modification (physical
  manipulation and unauthorised modifying). The TOE must ensure integrity of

  on it by enabling verification of their authenticity at the terminal-side. The TOE
  must ensure authenticity of the User Data and the TSF-data during their
  exchange between the TOE and the terminal connected (and represented by
  PACE authenticated BIS-PACE)after the PACE Authentication. It shall happen
  by enabling such a verification at the terminal-side (at receiving by the
  terminal) and by an active verification by the TOE itself (at receiving by the
  TOE).

OT.Data_Confidentiality
  Confidentiality of Data
  The TOE must ensure confidentiality of the User Data and the TSF-data by
  granting read access only to the PACE authenticated BIS-PACE connected. The
  TOE must ensure confidentiality of the User Data and the TSF-data during
  their exchange between the TOE and the terminal connected (and represented
  by PACE authenticated BIS-PACE) after the PACE Authentication.

                       eMRTD Configuration)

OT.Tracing
  Tracing travel document
  The TOE must prevent gathering TOE tracing data by means of unambiguous
  identifying the travel document remotely through establishing or listening to a
  communication via the contactless/contact interface of the TOE without
  knowledge of the correct values of shared passwords (PACE passwords) in
  advance.

OT.Prot_Abuse-Func
  Protection against Abuse of Functionality
  The TOE must prevent that functions of the TOE, which may not be used in
  TOE operational phase, can be abused in order (i) to manipulate or to disclose
  the User Data stored in the TOE, (ii) to manipulate or to disclose the TSF-data
  stored in the TOE, (iii) to manipulate (bypass, deactivate or modify) soft-
  coded security functionality of the TOE.

OT.Prot_Inf_Leak
  Potection against Information Leakage The TOE must provide protection
  against disclosure of confidential User Data or/and TSF-data stored and/or
  processed by the travel document
      by measurement and analysis of the shape and amplitude of signals or the
        time between events found by measuring signals on the electromagnetic
        field, power consumption, clock, or I/O lines,
      by forcing a malfunction of the TOE and/or
      by a physical manipulation of the TOE.

OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper
  Protection against Physical Tampering
  The TOE must provide protection the confidentiality and integrity of the User
  Data, the TSF Data, and the MRTD’s chip Embedded Software. This includes
  protection against attacks with high attack potential by means of
      measuring through galvanic contacts which is direct physical probing on
        the chips surface except on pads being bonded (using standard tools for
        measuring voltage and current) or
      measuring not using galvanic contacts but other types of physical
        interaction between charges (using tools used in solid-state physics
        research and IC failure analysis)
      manipulation of the hardware and its security features, as well as
      controlled manipulation of memory contents (User Data, TSF Data) with a
        prior
      reverse-engineering to understand the design and its properties and
        functions.

                        eMRTD Configuration)

OT.Prot_Malfunction
  Protection against Malfunctions
  The TOE must ensure its correct operation. The TOE must prevent its
  operation outside the normal operating conditions where reliability and secure
  operation have not been proven or tested. This is to prevent functional errors
  in the TOE. The environmental conditions may include external energy
  (especially electromagnetic) fields, voltage (on any contacts), clock frequency
  or temperature.

OT.Identification
  Identification and Authentication of the TOE
  The TOE must provide means to store Initialisation and Pre-Personalisation
  Data in its non-volatile memory. The Initialisation Data must provide a unique
  identification of the IC during the manufacturing and the card issuing life cycle
  phases of the travel document. The storage of the Pre-Personalisation data
  includes writing of the Personalisation Agent Key(s).

OT.AC_Pers
  Access Control for Personalisation of logical MRTD
  The TOE must ensure that the logical travel document data in EF.DG1 to
  EF.DG16, the Document Security Object according to LDS [ICAO-9303] and
  the TSF data can be written by authorized Personalisation Agents only. The
  logical travel document data in EF.DG1 to EF.DG16 and the TSF data may be
  written only during and cannot be changed after personalisation of the
  document.

4.1.2 Additional Security Objectives from PP EAC

OT.Sens_Data_Conf
  Confidentiality of sensitive biometric reference data
  The TOE must ensure the confidentiality of the sensitive biometric reference
  data (EF.DG3 and EF.DG4) by granting read access only to authorized
  Extended Inspection Systems. The authorization of the inspection system is
  drawn from the Inspection System Certificate used for the successful
  authentication and shall be a non-strict subset of the authorization defined in
  the Document Verifier Certificate in the certificate chain to the Country Verifier
  Certification Authority of the issuing State or Organisation. The TOE must
  ensure the confidentiality of the logical travel document data during their
  transmission to the Extended Inspection System. The confidentiality of the
  sensitive biometric reference data shall be protected against attacks with high
  attack potential.

OT.Polymorphic_Data_Confidentiality
  Confidentiality of eMRTD polymorphic data
  The TOE must ensure the confidentiality of the sensitive static polymorphic
  eMRTD PI, PP and CPI user data stored on the TOE during personalisation by
  denying all read access to everybody. Only read access to the randomized
  representation of the polymorphic user data is possible and only granted to
  authorized and authenticated Polymorphic Authentication Terminals/Services.
  The TOE must ensure the confidentiality of the eMRTD polymorphic User Data
  (randomized PI, PP and optional CPI) during their exchange between the TOE
  and the Polymorphic Authentication terminal/Service connected after
  successfully executing the sequence of PACE with PIN, PA, CAv1, TAv1 and

 Figure 1. Components of the TOE

                               Figure 1 shows the components of the TOE. The TOE is a composite product on top
                               of CC certified Hardware, Firmware and Crypto Library. Part of the TOE are the JCVM,
                               JCRE, JCAPI and the GP Framework. Also included is optional functionality and the
                               Secure Box mechanism. The Secure Box Native Librarys provide native functions for
                               untrusted third parties and are not part of the TOE.
                               The figure shows Java Card applets which are small programs in Java language that can
                               be executed by the TOE, but are not part of the TOE.

                     1.2.1 Usage and Major Security Features of the TOE
                               The usage of the TOE is focused on security critical applications in small form factors.
                               One main usage scenario is the use of so called smart cards. Examples of such cards
                               are banking cards or electronic drivers’ licenses. The TOE can also be used in an
                               electronic passport. Another usage scenario is device authentication, where the TOE can
                               be used to prove the authenticity or originality of a device like an accessory for a gaming
                               console.
                               The TOE provides a variety of security features. The hardware of the Micro Controller
                               already protects against logical and physical attacks by applying various sensors to
                               detect manipulations and by processing data in ways which protect against leakage
                               of data by side channel analysis. With the software stack the TOE provides many

  Application Note:
  This OT is an extension of the OT ‘OT.Data_Integrity’ defined in [PACE-PP] to
  ensure the integrity of the polymorphic eMRTD user data. This extension does
  not conflict with the strict conformance to PACE and EACv1 PPs.

OT.Polymorphic_Data_Authenticity
  Authenticity of eMRTD polymorphic data
  The TOE must ensure the authenticity of the polymorphic eMRTD randomized
  PI, PP and optional CPI data during their exchange between the TOE and
  Terminal/Authentication Service connected after successfully executing the
  sequence of PACE with PIN, CAv1, TAv1 and PMA.
  Application Note:
  This OT is an extension of the OT ‘OT.Data_Authenticity’ defined in [PACE-PP]
  to ensure the authenticity of the polymorphic eMRTD PI/PP/CPI data. This
  extension does not conflict with the strict conformance to PACE and EACv1
  PPs.

OT.Polymorphic_Data_Privacy
  Privacy of eMRTD polymorphic user data
  The TOE guarantees the privacy of the PI, PP and optional CPI user data by
  randomising the PI, PP and optional CPI user data during the polymorphic
  authentication (PMA), prior to returning it to the authorised Polymorphic
  Authentication Terminal/Service. This prevents the Authenication Service from
  being able to harvest any user or card unique identifiable data.
  Application Note:
  This OT has been added to this ST to ensure and maintain the privacy of the
  polymorphic     PI, PP and optional CPI user data during the Polymorphic
  Authentication (sequence of PACE with PIN, CAv1, TAv1 and PMA). This
  addition does not conflict with the strict conformance to PACE and EACv1 PPs.

OT.DoS
  PIN and PUK are blocking PACE passwords. Therefore the number of incorrect
  authentication attempts on the PACE PIN and PUK passwords shall be
  controlled by the TOE to prevent a denial of service.

  The TOE shall implement the suspend and resume mechanisms specified in
  [TR-3110-2] for blocking PACE passwords, PIN and (if present) PUK.



4.2 Security Objectives for the Operational Environment


4.2.1 Issuing State or Organisation
The Issuing State or Organization will implement the following security objectives
of the TOE environment.


OE.Legislative_Compliance
  Issuing of the travel document
  The travel document Issuer must issue the travel document and approve it
  using the terminals complying with all applicable laws and regulations.

OE.Auth_Key_Travel_Document
  Travel document Authentication Key
  The issuing State or Organisation has to establish the necessary public key
  infrastructure in order to (i) generate the travel document’s Chip
  Authentication Key Pair, (ii) sign and store the Chip Authentication Public Key
  in the Chip Authentication Public Key data in EF.DG14 and (iii) support
  inspection systems of receiving States or Organisations to verify the
  authenticity of the travel document’s chip used for genuine travel document by
  certification of the Chip Authentication Public Key by means of the Document
  Security Object.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to counter the Threat
  T.Counterfeit as it specifies the pre-requisite for the Chip Authentication
  Protocol Version 1 which is one of the additional features of the TOE described
  only in [EAC-PP-V2] and not in [PACE-PP].

                                 eMRTD Configuration)


OE.Auth_Key_MRTD
  MRTD Authentication Key4
  The issuing State or Organization has to establish the necessary public key
  infra-structure in order to (i) generate the MRTD’s Active Authentication Key
  Pair, (ii) sign and store the Active Authentication Public Key in the Active
  Authentication Public Key data in EF.DG15 (if generated) and (iii) support
  inspection systems of receiving States or organizations to verify the
  authenticity of the MRTD’s chip used for genuine MRTD by certification of the
  Active Authentication Public Key by means of the Document Security Object.



OE.Authoriz_Sens_Data
  Authorization for Use of Sensitive Biometric Reference Data
  The issuing State or Organisation has to establish the necessary public key
  infrastructure in order to limit the access to sensitive biometric reference data
  of travel document holders to authorized receiving States or Organisations.
  The Country Verifying Certification Authority of the issuing State or
  Organisation generates card verifiable Document Verifier Certificates for the
  authorized Document Verifier only.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Read_Sensitive_Data, the Organisational Security Policy P.Sensitive_Data
  and the Assumption A.Auth_PKI as it specifies the pre-requisite for the
  Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 as it concerns the need of an PKI for this
  protocol and the responsibilities of its root instance. The Terminal
  Authentication Protocol v.1 is one of the additional features of the TOE
  described only in [EAC-PP-V2] and not in [PACE-PP].

4.2.2 Travel document Issuer and CSCA: travel document PKI
(issuing) branch
The travel document Issuer and the related CSCA will implement the following
security objectives for the TOE environment:


OE.Passive_Auth_Sign
  Authentication of travel document by Signature.
  The travel document Issuer has to establish the necessary public key
  infrastructure as follows: the CSCA acting on behalf and according to the
  policy of the travel document Issuer must
      (i) generate a cryptographically secure CSCA Key Pair,
      (ii) ensure the secrecy of the CSCA Private Key and sign Document Signer
          Certificates in a secure operational environment, and

A.      Certification

1.      Preliminary Remarks
Under the BSIG1 Act, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) has the task of
issuing certificates for information technology products.
Certification of a product is carried out on the instigation of the vendor or a distributor,
hereinafter called the sponsor.
A part of the procedure is the technical examination (evaluation) of the product according
to the security criteria published by the BSI or generally recognised security criteria.
The evaluation is normally carried out by an evaluation facility recognised by the BSI or by
BSI itself.
The result of the certification procedure is the present Certification Report. This report
contains among others the certificate (summarised assessment) and the detailed
Certification Results.
The Certification Results contain the technical description of the security functionality of
the certified product, the details of the evaluation (strength and weaknesses) and
instructions for the user.

2.      Specifications of the Certification Procedure
The certification body conducts the procedure according to the criteria laid down in the
following:
●   Act on the Federal Office for Information Security1
●   BSI Certification and Approval Ordinance2
●   BSI Schedule of Costs3
●   Special decrees issued by the Bundesministerium des Innern (Federal Ministry of the
    Interior)
●   DIN EN ISO/IEC 17065 standard
●   BSI certification: Scheme documentation describing the certification process (CC-
    Produkte) [3]
●   BSI certification: Scheme documentation on requirements for the Evaluation Facility, its
    approval and licencing process (CC-Stellen) [3]

3.      Recognition Agreements
In order to avoid multiple certification of the same product in different countries a mutual
recognition of IT security certificates - as far as such certificates are based on ITSEC or
CC - under certain conditions was agreed.

3.1.    European Recognition of CC – Certificates (SOGIS-MRA)
The SOGIS-Mutual Recognition Agreement (SOGIS-MRA) Version 3 became effective in
April 2010. It defines the recognition of certificates for IT-Products at a basic recognition
level and, in addition, at higher recognition levels for IT-Products related to certain SOGIS
Technical Domains only.
The basic recognition level includes Common Criteria (CC) Evaluation Assurance Levels
EAL 1 to EAL 4. For "Smartcards and similar devices" a SOGIS Technical Domain is in
place. For "HW Devices with Security Boxes" a SOGIS Technical Domains is in place, too.
In addition, certificates issued for Protection Profiles based on Common Criteria are part of
the recognition agreement.
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes, details on
recognition, and the history of the agreement can be seen on the website at
https://www.sogisportal.eu.
The SOGIS-MRA logo printed on the certificate indicates that it is recognised under the
terms of this agreement by the related bodies of the signatory nations. A disclaimer
beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of recognition.
This certificate is recognized under SOGIS-MRA for all assurance components selected.

3.2.    International Recognition of CC – Certificates (CCRA)
The international arrangement on the mutual recognition of certificates based on the CC
(Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement, CCRA-2014) has been ratified on 08
September 2014. It covers CC certificates based on collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP)
(exact use), CC certificates based on assurance components up to and including EAL 2 or
the assurance family Flaw Remediation (ALC_FLR) and CC certificates for Protection
Profiles and for collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP).
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes can be seen on
the website: https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org.
The Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement logo printed on the certificate indicates
that this certification is recognised under the terms of this agreement by the related bodies
of the signatory nations. A disclaimer beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of
recognition.
This certificate is recognized according to the rules of CCRA-2014, i. e. up to and including
CC part 3 EAL 2+ ALC_FLR components.

4.      Performance of Evaluation and Certification
The certification body monitors each individual evaluation to ensure a uniorm procedure, a
uniform interpretation of the criteria and uniform ratings.
The product NXP Secure Smart Card Controller N7021 VA including IC Dedicated
Software has undergone the certification procedure at BSI. This is a re-certification based
on BSI-DSZ-CC-0977-2017. Specific results from the evaluation process BSI-DSZ-CC-
0977-2017 were re-used.
The evaluation of the product NXP Secure Smart Card Controller N7021 VA including IC
Dedicated Software was conducted by TÜV Informationstechnik GmbH. The evaluation
was completed on 18 July 2019. TÜV Informationstechnik GmbH is an evaluation facility
(ITSEF)5 recognised by the certification body of BSI.
For this certification procedure the sponsor and applicant is: NXP Semiconductors
Germany GmbH.
The product was developed by: NXP Semiconductors Germany GmbH.
The certification is concluded with the comparability check and the production of this
Certification Report. This work was completed by the BSI.

5.      Validity of the Certification Result
This Certification Report applies only to the version of the product as indicated. The
confirmed assurance package is valid on the condition that
●   all stipulations regarding generation, configuration and operation, as given in the
    following report, are observed,
●   the product is operated in the environment described, as specified in the following report
    and in the Security Target.
For the meaning of the assurance components and assurance levels please refer to CC
itself. Detailed references are listed in part C of this report.
The Certificate issued confirms the assurance of the product claimed in the Security Target
at the date of certification. As attack methods evolve over time, the resistance of the
certified version of the product against new attack methods needs to be re-assessed.
Therefore, the sponsor should apply for the certified product being monitored within the
assurance continuity program of the BSI Certification Scheme (e.g. by a re-assessment or
re-certification). Specifically, if results of the certification are used in subsequent evaluation
and certification procedures, in a system integration process or if a user's risk
management needs regularly updated results, it is recommended to perform a re-
assessment on a regular e.g. annual basis.
In order to avoid an indefinite usage of the certificate when evolved attack methods would
require a re-assessment of the products resistance to state of the art attack methods, the
maximum validity of the certificate has been limited. The certificate issued on 31 July 2019
is valid until 31 July 2024. Validity can be re-newed by re-certification.
The owner of the certificate is obliged:
     1. when advertising the certificate or the fact of the product's certification, to refer to
        the Certification Report as well as to provide the Certification Report, the Security

        Target and user guidance documentation mentioned herein to any customer of the
        product for the application and usage of the certified product,
     2. to inform the Certification Body at BSI immediately about vulnerabilities of the
        product that have been identified by the developer or any third party after issuance
        of the certificate,
     3. to inform the Certification Body at BSI immediately in the case that security relevant
        changes in the evaluated life cycle, e.g. related to development and production sites
        or processes, occur, or the confidentiality of documentation and information related
        to the Target of Evaluation (TOE) or resulting from the evaluation and certification
        procedure where the certification of the product has assumed this confidentiality
        being maintained, is not given any longer. In particular, prior to the dissemination of
        confidential documentation and information related to the TOE or resulting from the
        evaluation and certification procedure that do not belong to the deliverables
        according to the Certification Report part B, or for those where no dissemination
        rules have been agreed on, to third parties, the Certification Body at BSI has to be
        informed.
In case of changes to the certified version of the product, the validity can be extended to
the new versions and releases, provided the sponsor applies for assurance continuity (i.e.
re-certification or maintenance) of the modified product, in accordance with the procedural
requirements, and the evaluation does not reveal any security deficiencies.

1.     Executive Summary
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is the IC hardware platform “NXP Secure Smart Card
Controller N7021 VA including IC Dedicated Software” and documentation describing
instruction set and usage of the TOE. The TOE does not include a customer-specific
Security IC Embedded Software.
The IC Dedicated Software comprises IC Dedicated Test Software for test purposes and
IC Dedicated Support Software. The IC Dedicated Support Software consists of the Boot
Software, which controls the boot process of the hardware platform. Furthermore, it
provides a Firmware Interface and optionally a Library Interface, simplifying access to the
hardware for the Security IC Embedded Software. A System Mode OS is available
(optional), offering ready-to-use resource and access management for customer
applications that do not want to be exposed to the more low-level features of the TOE. The
Flashloader OS (optional) supports download of code and data to Flash by the Composite
Product Manufacturer before Operational Usage (e.g. during development). The
Symmetric Crypto Library (optional) provides simplified access to frequently used
symmetric cryptography algorithms.
The N7021 VA supports two logical cards (Card A and Card B). Both logical cards are
divided into a User Mode and a System Mode. The logical location of the Security IC
Embedded Software depends on the usage of the IC hardware platform. Card A is
reserved for Security IC Embedded Software developed by NXP. Card B is available for
Security IC Embedded Software developed by the customer. If a customer did not order
any NXP developed Security IC Embedded Software product, then User Mode Card A is
not present.
The Security Target [6] is the basis for this certification. It is based on the certified
Protection Profile Security IC Platform Protection Profile with Augmentation Packages
Version 1.0, 13 January 2014, BSI-CC-PP-0084-2014 [8].
The TOE Security Assurance Requirements (SAR) are based entirely on the assurance
components defined in Part 3 of the Common Criteria (see part C or [1], Part 3 for details).
The TOE meets the assurance requirements of the Evaluation Assurance Level EAL 6
augmented by ASE_TSS.2, ALC_FLR.1.
The TOE Security Functional Requirements (SFR) relevant for the TOE are outlined in the
Security Target [6] and [9], chapter 6. They are selected from Common Criteria Part 2 and
some of them are newly defined. Thus the TOE is CC Part 2 extended.
The TOE Security Functional Requirements are implemented by the following TOE

                                      Table 2: Deliverables of the TOE
The requirements for the delivery of the TOE are described in chapter 31 of the “Product
Data Sheet” [11]. For each delivery form of the hardware platform NXP offers two ways of
delivery of the TOE:
1. The customer collects the product himself at the NXP site.
2. The product is sent to the customer by NXP with special protective measures.
The TOE documentation and related software (items are marked in Table 5) are delivered
in electronic form by the document control centre of NXP.
The hardware version can be identified by a coded nameplate as described in [13]
chapters 2.9.2 and 3.2.



                                                                                                       14 / 32

The TOE further provides the FabKey which can be configured by the customer to hold
128 bytes for batch, wafer or die individual data and can be read out by the configuration
interface (see GetFabKey API in [17], chapter 5 and [23], chapter 5.2). The process of
FabKey submission is described in [11], chapter 26.
Only the configurations defined in [17], chapter 5.6.3.2, Tab. 5.40 and in [23], chapter
5.8.3.2, Tab. 5.57 are evaluated options.
The ST references the version of the Crypto Library. This version number is also noted in
the [27], chapter 2 thus the TOE components listed in the guidance are traceable to the
reference given in the Security Target [6] and [9]. Furthermore, [27], chapter 2 describes
the integrity and confidentiality check of files associated with the crypto library. It lists SHA-
256 values for each library file for identification purposes. In addition to identifying the
delivered components, the library identifies itself via its “GetVersion” command.

3.       Security Policy
The security policy enforced is defined by the selected set of Security Functional
Requirements and implemented by the TOE. It covers the following issues:
The Security Policy of the TOE is to provide basic security functionalities to be used by the
smart card operating system and the smart card application thus providing an overall
smart card system security. Therefore, the TOE will implement the symmetric
cryptographic block cipher algorithm to ensure the confidentiality of plain text data by
encryption and to support secure authentication protocols and it will provide a True
Random Number Generator (TRNG) and Deterministic Random Number Generator
(DRNG).
As the TOE is a hardware security platform, the security policy of the TOE is also to
provide protection against leakage of information (e.g. to ensure the confidentiality of
cryptographic keys during cryptographic functions performed by the TOE), against physical
probing, against malfunctions, against physical manipulations and against abuse of
functionality. Hence the TOE shall
     •   maintain the integrity and the confidentiality of data stored in the memory of the
         TOE and
     •   maintain the integrity, the correct operation and the confidentiality of security
         functionalities (security mechanisms and associated functions) provided by the
         TOE.
Specific details concerning the above mentioned security policies can be found in chapter
7 of the Security Target [6] and [9].

4.       Assumptions and Clarification of Scope
The Assumptions defined in the Security Target and some aspects of Threats and
Organisational Security Policies are not covered by the TOE itself. These aspects lead to
specific security objectives to be fulfilled by the TOE Environment. The following topics are
of relevance: OE.Process-Sec-IC, OE.Lim_Block_Loader, OE.Loader_Usage, OE.Check-
Init. Details can be found in the Security Target [6] and [9], chapter 4.3.




                                                                                             15 / 32

5.       Architectural Information
The IC hardware is a microcontroller incorporating a central processing unit (CPU),
memories accessible via a Memory Management Unit (MMU), cryptographic
coprocessors, other security components and several electrical communication interfaces.
The central processing unit supports a 32-/16-bit instruction set optimized for smart card
applications. The first and in some cases the second byte of an instruction are used for
operation encoding. On-chip memories are ROM, RAM and Flash. The Flash can be used
as data or program memory. It consists of highly reliable memory cells, which are designed
to provide data integrity. Flash is optimized for applications that require reliable non-volatile
data storage for data and program code. Dedicated security functionality protects the
contents of all memories.
The IC Dedicated Software comprises IC Dedicated Test Software for test purposes and
IC Dedicated Support Software. The IC Dedicated Support Software consists of the Boot
Software, which controls the boot process of the hardware platform. Furthermore, it
provides a Firmware Interface and optionally a Library Interface, simplifying access to the
hardware for the Security IC Embedded Software. A System Mode OS is available
(optional), offering ready-to-use resource and access management for customer
applications that do not want to be exposed to the more low-level features of the TOE. The
Flashloader OS (optional) supports download of code and data to Flash by the Composite
Product Manufacturer before Operational Usage (e.g. during development). The
Symmetric Crypto Library (optional) provides simplified access to frequently used
symmetric cryptography algorithms.

6.       Documentation
The evaluated documentation as outlined in table 2 is being provided with the product to
the customer. This documentation contains the required information for secure usage of
the TOE in accordance with the Security Target.
Additional obligations and notes for secure usage of the TOE as outlined in chapter 10 of
this report have to be followed.

7.       IT Product Testing
The developer’s testing effort can be summarised in the following aspects.
TOE test configuration and Developer’s testing approach:
     •   All TSF and related security mechanisms, subsystems and modules are tested in
         order to assure complete coverage of all SFR.
     •   Different classes of tests are performed to test the TOE in a sufficient manner
         •   Functional Module verification: For the functional verification, black-box testing
             and white-box testing is performed to ensure the correct functionality as
             specified in the functional specification and customer specifications (ordering
             options).
         •   Security Verification: This test category addresses the security mechanisms
             described in the Security Architecture description. Two main categories of
             security module verification are defined, i.e., integrity protection module




                                                                                           16 / 32
BSI-DSZ-CC-0977-V2-2019                                                       Certification Report




           verification (fault injection) and DPA module verification (side-channel analysis).
           This also includes black-box and white-box testing.
       •   Characterization: This mostly addresses production tests to measure varying
           parameters in post-silicon verification while all parameters are within the
           specified limits. The developer performs a Matrix Characterization Run to
           measure parameters using varying processes (corner material) and different
           temperatures.
       •   Qualification: This test category ensures that a developed IC is production ready
           and has the expected quality. This addresses
           •   electrostatic discharge due to electrostatic stress in the field (contactless
               communication),
           •   fast aging of the device due to high temperatures to guarantee the life time of
               the product
           •   Flash qualification to ensure that features like anti-tearing and wear levelling
               work as specified,
           •   Package qualification to ensure that the IC can be placed in the final delivery
               form (package) under industrial environments and the final product quality is
               achieved, and
           •   PUF qualification to ensure that the promised PUF properties hold in field
               conditions.
       •   Validation: Execution of all customer-visible use cases to ensure that the entire
           system works as defined for customer-visible operation. This includes
           •   on-chip test framework developed to use each officially released product
               variant and execute each public available API,
           •   a Java Card OS is used to execute reference transactions for banking and
               egov.
Independent Testing according to ATE_IND
Testing approach:
   •   The evaluator's objective regarding this aspect was to test the functionality of the
       TOE as described in the ST and to verify the developer's test results by repeating
       developer's tests and additionally add independent tests.
   •   In the course of the evaluation of the TOE the following classes of tests were
       carried out:
       •   Module tests,
       •   Simulation tests,
       •   Tests in User Mode of logical card A and B,
       •   Tests in System Mode of card A and B,
       •   Tests in test mode
       •   Hardware tests and
       •   Cryptographic library tests.

     •   With this kind of tests the entire security functionality of the TOE was tested.
Penetration Testing according to AVA_VAN
Overview:
     •   The penetration testing was partially performed using the developer’s testing
         environment, partially using the test environment of the evaluation body.
     •   All configurations of the TOE being intended to be covered by the current evaluation
         were tested.
     •   The overall test result is that no deviations were found between the expected and
         the actual test results; moreover, no attack scenario with the attack potential high
         was actually successful.
Penetration testing approach:
     •   Systematic search for potential vulnerabilities and known attacks in public domain
         sources, use of a list of vulnerabilities, and from a methodical analysis of the
         evaluation documents.
     •   Analysis why these vulnerabilities are unexploitable in the intended environment of
         the TOE.
     •   If the rationale is suspect in the opinion of the evaluator penetration tests are
         devised.
     •   Even if the rational is convincing in the opinion of the evaluator penetration tests are
         devised for some vulnerabilities, especially to support the argument of non-
         practicability of exploiting time in case of SPA, DPA and FI attacks.

8.       Evaluated Configuration
The N7021 VA can be delivered with various configuration options as described in chapter
1.4.2 of [6] and [9]. The configuration options are divided into two groups: major
configuration options and minor configuration options.
Three major configurations can be chosen by the customer during the ordering process:
     •   Configuration based on 320 kBytes of Flash memory as code space,
     •   Configuration based on 240 kBytes of Flash memory as code space,
     •   Configuration based on 144 kBytes of ROM memory as code space.
Each major configuration is provided with several minor configuration options. These minor
configuration options (and all others) for NXP Secure Smart Card Controller N7021 VA can
be selected by the customer via Order Entry Form (see [28]). The Order Entry Form
identifies all the minor configuration options, which are supported by the major
configuration.
The N7021 VA hardware platform was tested including all minor configuration options that
can be selected based on Table 1.2 in chapter 1.4.2.2 of [6] and [9]. All minor
configurations were available to the evaluator. The major configuration does not have
dependencies to security features. All minor configuration options that are part of the
evaluation were tested. The minor configuration options behave as specified and
described in [11] and [20]. Therefore the results described in this document are applicable
for all minor configurations described in [6] and [9].

The Evaluation Technical Report (ETR) [7] was provided by the ITSEF according to the
Common Criteria [1], the Methodology [2], the requirements of the Scheme [3] and all
interpretations and guidelines of the Scheme (AIS) [4] as relevant for the TOE.
The Evaluation Methodology CEM [2] was used for those components up to EAL 5
extended by advice of the Certification Body for components beyond EAL 5 and guidance
specific for the technology of the product [4] (AIS 34).
The following guidance specific for the technology was used:
(i)        The Application of CC to Integrated Circuits
(ii)       Application of Attack Potential to Smartcards
(iii)      Guidance, Smartcard Evaluation
(see [4], AIS 25, AIS 37).
For RNG assessment the scheme interpretations AIS 31 was used (see [4]).
To support composite evaluations according to AIS 36 the document ETR for composite
evaluation [10] was provided and approved. This document provides details of this
platform evaluation that have to be considered in the course of a composite evaluation on
top.
As a result of the evaluation the verdict PASS is confirmed for the followin g assurance
components:
●     All components of the EAL 6 package including the class ASE as defined in the CC (see
      also part C of this report).

A.      Certification

1.      Preliminary Remarks
Under the BSIG1 Act, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) has the task of
issuing certificates for information technology products.
Certification of a product is carried out on the instigation of the vendor or a distributor,
hereinafter called the sponsor.
A part of the procedure is the technical examination (evaluation) of the product according
to the security criteria published by the BSI or generally recognised security criteria.
The evaluation is normally carried out by an evaluation facility recognised by the BSI or by
BSI itself.
The result of the certification procedure is the present Certification Report. This report
contains among others the certificate (summarised assessment) and the detailed
Certification Results.
The Certification Results contain the technical description of the security functionality of
the certified product, the details of the evaluation (strength and weaknesses) and
instructions for the user.

2.      Specifications of the Certification Procedure
The certification body conducts the procedure according to the criteria laid down in the
following:
●   Act on the Federal Office for Information Security1
●   BSI Certification and Approval Ordinance2
●   BSI Schedule of Costs3
●   Special decrees issued by the Bundesministerium des Innern (Federal Ministry of the
    Interior)

3.      Recognition Agreements
In order to avoid multiple certification of the same product in different countries a mutual
recognition of IT security certificates - as far as such certificates are based on ITSEC or
CC - under certain conditions was agreed.

3.1.    European Recognition of CC – Certificates (SOGIS-MRA)
The SOGIS-Mutual Recognition Agreement (SOGIS-MRA) Version 3 became effective in
April 2010. It defines the recognition of certificates for IT-Products at a basic recognition
level and, in addition, at higher recognition levels for IT-Products related to certain SOGIS
Technical Domains only.
The basic recognition level includes Common Criteria (CC) Evaluation Assurance Levels
EAL 1 to EAL 4. For "Smartcards and similar devices" a SOGIS Technical Domain is in
place. For "HW Devices with Security Boxes" a SOGIS Technical Domains is in place, too.
In addition, certificates issued for Protection Profiles based on Common Criteria are part of
the recognition agreement.
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes, details on
recognition, and the history of the agreement can be seen on the website at
https://www.sogisportal.eu.
The SOGIS-MRA logo printed on the certificate indicates that it is recognised under the
terms of this agreement by the related bodies of the signatory nations. A disclaimer
beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of recognition.
This certificate is recognized under SOGIS-MRA for all assurance components selected.

3.2.    International Recognition of CC – Certificates (CCRA)
The international arrangement on the mutual recognition of certificates based on the CC
(Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement, CCRA-2014) has been ratified on 08
September 2014. It covers CC certificates based on collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP)
(exact use), CC certificates based on assurance components up to and including EAL 2 or
the assurance family Flaw Remediation (ALC_FLR) and CC certificates for Protection
Profiles and for collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP).
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes can be seen on
the website: https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org.
The Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement logo printed on the certificate indicates
that this certification is recognised under the terms of this agreement by the related bodies
of the signatory nations. A disclaimer beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of
recognition.
This certificate is recognized according to the rules of CCRA-2014, i. e. up to and including
CC part 3 EAL 2+ ALC_FLR components.

                      mechanisms for memory protection and security exceptions as well as sensors, which
                      allow operation under specified conditions only. Memory encryption is used for memory
                      protection and chip shielding is added to the chip.

                      Note: Large integer arithmetic operations are intended to be used for calculation of
                      asymmetric cryptographic algorithms. Any asymmetric cryptographic algorithm utilizing
                      the support for large integer arithmetic operations has to be implemented in the Security
                      IC Embedded Software. Thus, the support for large integer arithmetic operations itself
                      does not provide security functionality like cryptographic support. The Security IC
                      Embedded Software implementing an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm is not included
                      in this evaluation. Nevertheless the support for large integer arithmetic operations is
                      part of the Security IC and therefore a security relevant component of the P6022P VB/
                      P6022X VB, that must resist to the attacks mentioned in this Security Target and that
                      must operate correctly as specified in the data sheet. The same scope of evaluation is
                      applied to the CRC calculation.

Type                  Na     TSF_OS contains all security functionalities provided by the certified platform (IC, Javacard opera-
          tion system). The cryptographic operations needed for this TOE are provided by the platform:
              o   Electronic signature-generation with RSA and key sizes of 2000 up to 4096 bit in steps of 1
                  bit, or ECDSA with key sizes of key sizes of 160 bit to 521 bit in steps of one bit.
              o   Secure messaging with AES (128, 192 or 256 bit key length).
              o   PACE authentication with key lengths of 160 bit to 521 bit in steps of one bit (ECC).

1.4.7 TOE life cycle
This paragraph is based on the protection profile [PP0075].

1.4.7.1    General



4 In the context of this security target the three categories are defined as follows: initialization comprises
the preparation of the TOE based on proprietary operations of the platform with the Java Card operation
system; pre-personalization comprises the configuration of the card manager and security domains as well
as the generation of applet instances using Global Platform commands. Personalization is carried out after-
wards using commands of the applet layer of the TOE.

Figure 3: Example of TOE lifecycle following figure 1 of [PP0075]. Note that import of certificate info during
TOE preparation and deletion of certificate info when SCD is destroyed are optional. The delivery to the
SSCD provisioning service after the development phase is also the end of the scope of the certification ac-
cording to Common Criteria.

The operational usage of the TOE comprises the preparation stage and the operational use stage. The TOE
operational use stage begins when the signatory has obtained both the VAD and the TOE. Enabling the TOE
for signing requires at least one set of SCD stored in its memory.
Figure 3 shows an example of the lifecycle where an SCD or SCD/SVD pair is imported from SSCD-
provisioning service before delivery to the signatory. The lifecycle may allow import of SCD or SCD/SVD key
pairs after delivery to the signatory as well.
The TOE life cycle ends when all keys stored in it have been rendered permanently unusable. Rendering a
key in the SSCD unusable may include deletion of any stored corresponding certificate info. The lifecycle
may allow generation of SCD or SCD/SVD key pairs after delivery to the signatory as well.

1.4.7.2   Preparation stage
The preparation phase of the TOE lifecycle is processing the TOE from the customer's acceptance of the
delivered TOE to a state ready for operation by the signatory. The customer receiving the TOE from the

manufacturer is the SSCD-provisioning service that prepares and provides the SSCD to subscribers. The
preparation includes
         Create and configure the signature application according to AGD_PRE; this step involves applet
          instanciation as well as creation of the file system (card profile).5
         The personalisation of the TOE for use by the signatory, i.e. the installation of the RAD in the TOE
          and handover of VAD to the signatory.
         The initialisation of the TOE, i.e. the CSP generates the SCD/SVD pair by means of a SCD/SVD gen-
          eration device, loads the SCD to the TOE, and sends the SVD to the CGA. The TOE may import and
          store the SCD/SVD pair.
         The generation of the (qualified) certificate containing among others (cf. [1], Annex II)
              a) the SVD which correspond to SCD under the control of the signatory;
              b) the name of the signatory or a pseudonym, which is to be identified as such,
              c) an indication of the beginning and end of the period of validity of the certificate.

         The preparation may include optional loading of the certificate info into the SSCD for signatory con-
          venience.
The CSP generates a SCD/SVD pair and imports SCD, and optionally also SVD, into the SSCD. The CSP ensures
          a) the correspondence between SCD and SVD,
          b) that algorithm and key size for the SVD are appropriate.

Please take note that verifying whether the claimed identity of the signer originates from that given SSCD
has to be done by the CSP operating the CGA.
If the TOE is used for creation of advanced electronic signatures, the certificate links the signature verifica-
tion data to the person (i.e. the signatory) and confirms the identity of that person (cf. [Directive], article 2,
Clause 9).
This security target requires the TOE to provide mechanisms for import of SCD, implementation of the SCD
and personalisation. The environment is assumed to protect all other processes for TOE preparation like
SCD transfer between the SCD/SVD generation device and the TOE, and SVD transfer between the SCD/SVD
generation device and the CGA. The CSP may export the SVD to the TOE for internal use by the TOE (e.g.,
self-test).
Before generating a (qualified) certificate, the CSP is expected to first store the SCD in a SSCD. A secure
channel with the TOE may be used to support this, by ensuring integrity of the SCD during transmission to
the TOE.

1.4.7.3    Operational use stage
In this lifecycle stage the signatory can use the TOE to create advanced electronic signatures.
The operational phase of the TOE starts when at least one SCD/SVD pair is generated by the CSP and the
SCD is imported into the SSCD and when the signatory takes control over the TOE and makes the SCD oper-
ational. The signatory uses the TOE with a trustworthy SCA in a secured environment only. The SCA is as-
sumed to protect the DTBS/R during the transmission to the TOE.




5 This preparation step has been added to the life cycle definition of the underlying Protection Profile and
is necessary to provide the basic functionality (i.e. application and file system) for the following steps. It
may be performed by the SSCD-provisioning service provider directly or by a separate entity (card manu-
facturer).

                                                    13 of 82
NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 / SSCD with Key Import Security Target Lite


The signatory can also interact with the SSCD to perform management tasks, e.g. reset a RAD value or use
counter if the password/PIN in the reference data has been lost or blocked. Such management tasks require
a secure environment.
The signatory can render an SCD in the TOE permanently unusable. Rendering the last SCD in the TOE per-
manently unusable ends the life of the TOE as SSCD.
The TOE may support functions to generate additional signing keys. If the TOE supports these functions it
will support further functions to securely obtain certificates for the new keys. For an additional key the
signatory may be allowed to choose the kind of certificate (qualified, or not) to obtain for the SVD of the
new key. The signatory may also be allowed to choose some of the data in the certificate request for in-
stance to use a pseudonym instead of the legal name in the certificate5. If the conditions to obtain a quali-
fied certificate are met, the new key can also be used to create advanced electronic signatures. The optional
TOE functions for additional key generation and certification may require additional security functions in
the TOE and an interaction with the SSCD-provisioning service provider in an environment that is secure.
The TOE life cycle as SSCD ends when all SCD stored in the TOE are destructed. This may include deletion of
the corresponding certificates.

Functionalities of the Platform ST are relevant for this Composite ST and which are irrelevant. The first col-
umn addresses specific Security Functionality of the underlying platform, which is assigned to Security Func-
tionalities of the Composite ST in the second column. The last column provides additional information on
the correspondence if necessary.
