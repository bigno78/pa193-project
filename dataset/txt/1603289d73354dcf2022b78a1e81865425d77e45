                              1.3 TOE Overview


                           1.3.1 Introduction
                                    The Hardware Security Target [13] contains, in section 1.3 ‚ÄúTOE Overview‚Äù, an
                                    introduction about the N7021 hardware TOE that is considered in the evaluation. The
                                    Hardware Security Target includes IC Dedicated Software provided with the N7021
                                    hardware platform.
                                    The ‚ÄúCrypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA‚Äú is a cryptographic library that can be used by
                                    the Security IC Embedded Software. The cryptographic library consists of several binary
                                    packages that are intended to be linked to the Security IC Embedded Software. The
                                    Security IC Embedded Software developer links the binary packages that he needs to his
                                    Embedded Software and the whole is subsequently implemented in arbitrary memory of
                                    the hardware platform.
                                    The NXP N7021 provides the computing platform and cryptographic support by means of
                                    co-processors for the Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA.
                                    The Crypto Library Cobalt on N7021 VA provides the security functionality described
                                    below in addition to the functionality described in the Hardware Security Target [13] for

                               The availability of minor configuration options partly depends on the selected major
                               configuration option. However in general the minor configuration options can be chosen
                               independently.

                               Plus MF1PLUSx0 which are listed in Table 6.
                               MIFARE functionality does not implement any Security Functional Requirement and its
                               functionality is therefore not in the scope of the evaluation and does not interfere with the

                           number.
                           The package types do not influence the security functionality of the P6022P VB/P6022X
                           VB. They only define which pads are connected in the package and for what purpose
                           and in which environment the chip can be used. Note that the security of the P6022P VB/
                           P6022X VB is not dependent on which pad is connected or not - the connections just
                           define how the product can be used. If the P6022P VB/P6022X VB is delivered as wafer
                           the customer can choose the connections on his own.
                           Security during development and production is ensured for all package types listed
                           above, for details refer to Section 1.4.4.
                           The commercial type name identifies major configuration and package type of the
                           P6022P VB/P6022X VB as well as the Security IC Embedded Software. However, the
                           commercial type name does not itemize the minor configuration options of the P6022P
                           VB/P6022X VB, which are introduced in Section 1.4.2.2.1. Instead, minor configuration
                           options are identified in the Order Entry Form, which is assigned to the ROM code
                           number and the FabKey number of the commercial type name.

                           number.
                           The package types do not influence the security functionality of the P6022M VB/P6022D
                           VB/P6022J VB. They only define which pads are connected in the package and for what
                           purpose and in which environment the chip can be used. Note that the security of the
                           P6022M VB/P6022D VB/P6022J VB is not dependent on which pad is connected or not -
                           the connections just define how the product can be used. If the P6022M VB/P6022D VB/
                           P6022J VB is delivered as wafer the customer can choose the connections on his own.
                           Security during development and production is ensured for all package types listed
                           above, for details refer to Section 1.4.4.
                           The commercial type name identifies major configuration and package type of the
                           P6022M VB/P6022D VB/P6022J VB as well as the Security IC Embedded Software.
                           However, the commercial type name does not itemize the minor configuration options
                           of the P6022M VB/P6022D VB/P6022J VB, which are introduced in Section 1.4.2.2.
                           Instead, minor configuration options are identified in the Order Entry Form, which is
                           assigned to the ROM code number and the FabKey number of the commercial type
                           name.
                           Minor configuration options as well as configuration options changed by means of
                           Hardware Post Delivery Configuration are coded in the Security Rows and can be read
                           out for identification of the P6022M VB/P6022D VB/P6022J VB. Further details regarding
                           Security Rows content and identification of the P6022M VB/P6022D VB/P6022J VB after
                           applying Hardware Post Delivery Configuration, please refer to [9]. Minor configuration
                           options changed by means of MIFARE Post Delivery Configuration can be read out for
                           identification of the P6022M VB/P6022D VB/P6022J VB by the Security IC Embedded
                           Software . Further details regarding identification of the P6022M VB/P6022D VB/P6022J
                           VB after applying MIFARE Post Delivery Configuration, please refer to [9].
                           MIFARE functionality does not implement any Security Functional Requirement and its
                           functionality is therefore not in the scope of the evaluation and does not interfere with the
                           security functionality provided by the IC hardware platform.

              1.4.3.1 Hardware description
                           The CPU of the TOE NXP Secure Smart Card Controller P6022y VB supports
                           a 32-/24-/16-/8-bit instruction set and distinguishes five CPU modes, which are
                           summarized in Table 20.

Table 20. CPU modes of the TOE
Super System Mode                                                                                  System Mode     User Mode

                      Boot Mode, Test Mode and Firmware Mode are sub-modes of the so-called Super
                      System Mode. These three modes are not available to the Security IC Embedded
                      Software; they are reserved for the IC Dedicated Software. The IC Dedicated Software
                      is composed of IC Dedicated Test Software and IC Dedicated Support Software (Boot-
                      ROM Software and Firmware Operating System) as introduced in Section 1.4.1.1. The
                      three software components are mapped one-to-one to the three CPU modes: In Boot
                      Mode the TOE executes the Boot-ROM Software, in Test Mode the TOE executes the
                      IC Dedicated Test Software and in Firmware Mode the TOE executes the Firmware
                      Operating System. Please note that the Super System Mode is not a mode on its own:
                      When the TOE is in Super System Mode, it is always either in Boot Mode, Test Mode or
                      Firmware Mode.
                      The TOE is able to control two different logical phases. After production of the Security IC
                      every start-up or reset completes with Test Mode and execution of the IC Dedicated Test
                      Software. The Test Mode is disabled at the end of the production test. Afterwards, every
                      start-up or reset ends up in System Mode and execution of the Security IC Embedded
                      Software.
                      In case the minor configuration option 'Post Delivery Configuration' is enabled and
                      not finally locked by the customer, the resource configuration functionality allows the
                      customer to enable or disable specific functionality of the hardware platform. Please refer
                      to Table 9 for details.
                      In case the minor configuration option 'Chip Health/Ident Mode' is enabled, during the
                      boot process routines either starting built-in self tests checking the functional integrity of
                      the TOE or sending back identification items of the TOE can be activated by the user.
                      System Mode and User Mode are available to the developer of the Security IC
                      Embedded Software. System Mode has unlimited access to the hardware components
                      available to the Security IC Embedded Software. User Mode has restricted access
                      to the CPU, specific Special Function Registers and the memories depending on the
                      access rights granted by software running in System Mode. The hardware components
                      are controlled by the Security IC Embedded Software via Special Function Registers.
                      Special Function Registers are interrelated to the activities of the CPU, the Memory
                      Management Unit, interrupt control, I/O configuration, EEPROM, timers, UART, the
                      contactless interface and the coprocessors.
                      The TOE provides two types of interrupts: (i) exception interrupts, called 'exception' in
                      the following and (ii) event interrupts, called 'interrupts' in the following. Exceptions and
                      interrupts each force a jump to a specific fixed vector address in the ROM. Any exception
                      and interrupt can therefore be controlled and guided by a specific part of the Security
                      IC Embedded Software. In addition, the TOE provides eight firmware vectors (FVEC)
                      and 32 system call vectors (SVEC). These vectors have to be explicitly called by the
                      Security IC Embedded Software. A jump to a firmware vector forces Firmware Mode and
                      starts execution of the Firmware Operating System, a jump to a system call vector forces
                      System Mode.
                      The Watchdog timer is intended to abort irregular program executions by a time-out
                      mechanism and is enabled and configured by the Security IC Embedded Software.

                      The TOE incorporates memory types ROM, RAM and EEPROM (see Table 21 for
                      memory sizes). Access control to all three memory types is enforced by a Memory
                      Management Unit. The Memory Management Unit partitions each memory into two parts:
                      ‚Ä¢ ROM is partitioned in Application-ROM and Test-ROM (see Table 21). Application-
                        ROM is reserved for the Security IC Embedded Software and Test-ROM reserved
                        for the IC Dedicated Software. The Security IC Dedicated Support Software located
                        in ROM always includes the full MIFARE functionality. Depending on selected major
                        configuration option dedicated MIFARE functionality is deactivated. Note that the ROM
                        size is displayed as Application-ROM size in the block diagram in Fig. 1 because only
                        Application-ROM is available to the Security IC Embedded Software,
                      ‚Ä¢ RAM is partitioned in Application-RAM, and FOS-RAM (see Table 21). Application-
                        RAM is reserved for the Security IC Embedded Software, and FOS-RAM for the
                        Firmware Operating System part of the IC Dedicated Support Software,
                      ‚Ä¢ EEPROM is partitioned into the available EEPROM for the Security IC Embedded
                        Software and the remaining part:
                        ‚Äì 512 Bytes of the EEPROM are always reserved for the manufacturer area,
                        ‚Äì 1024 Bytes of the EEPROM are always reserved for IC Dedicated Support Software
                          for FOS control data,
                        ‚Äì 768 Bytes of the EEPROM are reserved for the PUF block,
                        ‚Äì remaining part of the EEPROM is reserved for MIFARE Software part of the
                          IC Dedicated Support Software depending on the major configuration option.
                          Furthermore the IC Dedicated Support Software contains functionality for
                          programming the user EEPROM which must be called by the Security IC Embedded
                          Software. Therefore the IC Dedicated Support Software has access also to the
                          EEPROM area which is allocated to the Security IC Embedded Software, the
                          separation between user data and NXP firmware data is guaranteed by means of a
                          firewall.
                      In Test Mode the CPU has unrestricted access to all memories. In Boot Mode and
                      Firmware Mode access is limited to the Test-ROM, the manufacturer area of the
                      EEPROM, FOS control data in EEPROM and the EEPROM space owned by MIFARE
                      Software as well as the configured part of FOS-RAM. All other parts of the memories are
                      accessible in System Mode and User Mode, namely the Application-ROM, Application-
                      RAM and the larger parts of EEPROM. User Mode is further restricted by the Memory
                      Management Unit, which can be configured in System Mode.
                      Application-RAM is further split in two parts. These are general purpose RAM (CXRAM)
                      and FXRAM (associated to the Fame2 coprocessor). Please refer to Table 21 for
                      further details about the size of CXRAM. Both parts are accessible to the CPU, but the
                      Fame2 coprocessor can only access the FXRAM. The Fame2 coprocessor can access

                      the FXRAM without control of access rights by the Memory Management Unit. Since
                      the Memory Management Unit does not control accesses of the Fame2 coprocessor,
                      software which has access to the Fame2 coprocessor implicitly has access to the
                      FXRAM.
                      The Triple-DES coprocessor supports single DES and Triple-DES operations. Only
                      Triple-DES is in the scope of this evaluation, in 2-key or 3-key operation with two/three
                      56-bit keys (112-/168-bit). The AES coprocessor supports AES operation with three
                      different key lengths of 128, 192 or 256 bit. The Fame2 coprocessor supplies basic
                      arithmetic functions to support implementation of asymmetric cryptographic algorithms
                      by the Security IC Embedded Software. The random number generator provides true
                      random numbers without pseudo random calculation. The CRC coprocessor provides
                      CRC generation polynomial CRC-16 and CRC-32. The copy machine supports a
                      mechanism to transfer data between specific Special Function Registers as well as
                      memories without interaction of the CPU.
                      The TOE operates with a single external power supply of 1.8 V, 3 V or 5 V nominal.
                      Alternatively the TOE can be supplied via the RF interface by inductive coupling.
                      The maximum external clock frequency used for synchronization of the ISO/IEC
                      7816 communication is 10 MHz nominal, the CPU and all coprocessors are supplied
                      exclusively with an internally generated clock signal which frequency can be selected
                      by the Security IC Embedded Software. The TOE provides power saving modes with
                      reduced activity. These are named IDLE Mode and SLEEP Mode, of which the latter one
                      includes CLOCK STOP Mode.
                      The TOE protects secret data, which are stored to and operated by the TOE, against
                      physical tampering. A memory encryption is added to the memories RAM, ROM and
                      EEPROM. EEPROM double read function is included in this memory to check data
                      consistency during EEPROM read. The PUF block supports the sealing/unsealing of user
                      data of the Composite TOE in the memory. Chip shielding is added in form of active and
                      passive shield over logic and memories. Sensors in form of light, voltage, temperature
                      and frequency sensors are distributed over the chip area. The security functionality of the
                      IC hardware platform is mainly provided by the TOE, and completed by the Security IC
                      Embedded Software. This causes dependencies between the security functionality of the
                      TOE and the security functionality provided by the Security IC Embedded Software.


              1.4.3.2 Software description
                      Operating system and applications of a Security IC are developed by the customers and
                      included under the heading Security IC Embedded Software. The Security IC Embedded
                      Software is stored in the Application-ROM and/or in the Application-EEPROM and is not
                      part of the TOE. The Security IC Embedded Software depends on the usage of the IC
                      hardware platform.
                      The IC Dedicated Test Software of the TOE P6022y VB are stored to the Test-ROM
                      and are used by the manufacturer of the Security IC during production test. The test
                      functionality is disabled before the TOE is delivered (operational use of the Security IC)
                      by disabling the Test Mode of the CPU in hardware. The IC Dedicated Test Software is
                      developed by NXP and embedded in the Test-ROM. The IC Dedicated Test Software
                      includes the test operating system, test routines for the various blocks of the circuitry,
                      control flags for the status of the EEPROM's manufacturer area and shutdown functions
                      to ensure that security relevant test routines cannot be executed illegally after phase 3.
                      The following figure shows the logical boundary of the hardware platform (see also Fig.
                      1) with the IC Dedicated Software of the TOE.

                      memories and Special Function Register as configured in hardware or by the Security IC
                      Embedded Software.
                      The P6022P VB/P6022X VB is always delivered with a FOS-Plain. The related
                      functionality is part of the hardware platform evaluation. The FOS-Plain of the P6022P
                      VB/P6022X VB is limited to the control of hardware related functionality and the resource
                      configuration functionality.
                      The FOS-Plain for the P6022X VB is the same as P6022P VB with optimized memory
                      to free-up additional ROM for application OS. Firmware ROM hex files for P6022X VB
                      and P6022P VB are generated from the same design sources for Firmware. Usage of
                      different compile switch settings results in excluding MIFARE Plus and MIFARE Desfire
                      related code for P6022X VB.

                      stored to the Test-ROM and consists of the Boot-ROM Software and FOS.
                      The Firmware Operating System provides an interface for the Security IC Embedded
                      Software. This interface is called FVEC. There are several FVECs defined, namely
                      FVEC0.x, FVEC2.x and FVEC7.x. The letter 'x' is a placeholder for the sub functions of
                      the FVECs. 'x' can be a number between 1 and 255. Please note not all sub numbers are
                      valid. Therefore please refer to [17] for a detailed description of the FVEC interface and
                      all sub functions.
                      ‚Ä¢ FVEC0.x: This interface establishes the contactless communication according to
                        ISO/IEC 14443 for the Security IC Embedded Software. Furthermore it provides sub
                        functions to enable MIFARE Software.
                      ‚Ä¢ FVEC2.x: This interface provides the service to seal/unseal user data in a defined
                        memory area using the Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) block. This interface is
                        also used to read/clear the attack detector status and to read the error counter value.
                      ‚Ä¢ FVEC7.x: This interface implements programming of the internal EEPROM memory,
                        which is mandatory for use by the Security IC Embedded Software when programming
                        the EEPROM memory.
                      The Emulation Firmware Operating System includes the MIFARE Software, which is
                      started by an FVEC call of the Security IC Embedded Software, as described above.
                      ‚Ä¢ In addition the IC Dedicated Support Software can be used via an FVEC0.x call to
                        establish the contactless communication according to ISO/IEC 14443 for the Security
                        IC Embedded Software. Please refer to [9] for more information.
                      ‚Ä¢ The execution of the Firmware Operating System is separated by security mechanisms
                        implemented in the hardware including the firewall separation of the Firmware Mode
                        controlling the access to memories and Special Function Registers as configured in
                        hardware or by the Security IC Embedded Software.
                      ‚Ä¢ The P6022M VB/P6022D VB/P6022J VB is always delivered with a Firmware
                        Operating System. The related functionality is part of the hardware platform evaluation.
                        The Firmware Operating System of the P6022M VB/P6022D VB/P6022J VB includes
                        the control of hardware related functionality, the resource configuration functionality,
                        and the MIFARE Software.
                      MIFARE functionality does not implement any Security Functional Requirement and its
                      functionality is therefore not in the scope of the evaluation and does not interfere with the
                      security functionality provided by the IC hardware platform.

               1.4.4 Security during development and production
                        The Security IC product life-cycle is scheduled in phases as introduced in the PP [6].
                        IC Development as well as IC Manufacturing and Testing, which are phases 2 and 3
                        of the life-cycle, are part of the evaluation. Phase 4 the IC Packaging is also part of the
                        evaluation. The Security IC is delivered at the end of phase 3 or phase 4 in the life-cycle.
                        The development and production environment of the TOE ranges from phase 2 to TOE
                        Delivery. With respect to Application Note 3 in [6] the TOE supports the authentic delivery
                        using the "Chip Health/Ident Mode" and the FabKey feature. For further details on these
                        features please refer to the data sheet [9] and the guidance and operation manual [11].
                        During the design and the layout process only people involved in the specific
                        development project for an IC have access to sensitive data. Different people are
                        responsible for the design data and for customer related data.
                        The production of the wafers includes two different steps regarding the production
                        flow. In the first step the wafers are produced with the fixed masks independent of the
                        customer. After that step the wafers are completed with the customer specific mask,
                        including the ROM Code, and the remaining mask set.
                        The test process of every die is performed by a test centre of NXP. Delivery processes
                        between the involved sites provide accountability and traceability of the TOE. NXP
                        embeds the dice into modules, inlays or packages based on customer demand.
                        Information about non-functional items is stored on magnetic/optical media enclosed with
                        the delivery or the non-functional items are physically marked. In summary, the TOE can
                        be delivered in four different forms, which are
                        ‚Ä¢   dice on wafers

                        ‚Ä¢   packaged devices in tubes or reels
                        The availability of major configuration options of the TOE in package types is detailed in
                        Section 1.4.2.4.


               1.4.5 TOE intended usage


              1.4.5.1   NXP Secure Smart Card Controller P6022y VB
                        The end-consumer environment of the P6022y VB is phase 7 of the Security IC product
                        life-cycle as defined in the PP [6]. In this phase the Security IC product is in usage by the
                        end-consumer. Its method of use now depends on the Security IC Embedded Software.
                        The Security ICs including the P6022y VB can be used to assure authorized conditional
                        access in a wide range of applications. Examples are identity cards, Banking Cards, Pay-
                        TV, Portable communication SIM cards, Health cards and Transportation cards. The
                        end-user environment covers a wide spectrum of very different functions, thus making it
                        difficult to monitor and avoid abuse of the P6022y VB. The P6022y VB is intended to be
                        used in an insecure environment, which does not protect against threats.
                        The device is developed for most high-end safeguarded applications, and is designed
                        for embedding into chip cards according to ISO/IEC 7816 [21] and for contactless
                        applications according to ISO/IEC 14443 [22]. Usually a Security IC (e.g. a smartcard) is
                        assigned to a single individual only, but it may also be used by multiple applications in a
                        multi-provider environment. Therefore the P6022y VB might store and process secrets

                        of several systems, which must be protected from each other. The P6022y VB then must
                        meet security requirements for each single security module. Secret data shall be used
                        as input for calculation of authentication data, calculation of signatures and encryption of
                        data and keys.
                        In development and production environment of the P6022y VB the Security IC Embedded
                        Software developer and system integrators such as the terminal software developer may
                        use samples of the P6022y VB for their testing purposes. It is not intended that they are
                        able to change the behaviour of the Security IC in another way than an end-consumer.
                        The user environment of the P6022y VB ranges from TOE delivery to phase 7 of the
                        Security IC product life-cycle, and must be a controlled environment up to phase 6.
                        Note: The phases from TOE Delivery to phase 7 of the Security IC Product life-cycle
                        are not part of the P6022y VB construction process in the sense of this Security Target.
                        Information about these phases is just included to describe how the P6022y VB is used
                        after its construction. Nevertheless such security functionality of the P6022y VB, that is
                        independent of the Security IC Embedded Software, is active at TOE Delivery and cannot
                        be disabled by the Security IC Embedded Software in the following phases.


               1.4.6 Interface of the TOE


              1.4.6.1   NXP Secure Smart Card Controller P6022P VB/P6022X VB
                        The electrical interface of the P6022P VB/P6022X VB are the pads to connect the lines
                        power supply, ground, reset input, clock input, serial communication pads I/O1 and
                        depending on a minor configuration option TP1 and TP2, as well as two pads (called LA
                        and LB) for the antenna of the RF interface. Communication with the P6022P VB/P6022X
                        VB can be established via the contact interface through the ISO/IEC 7816 UART or direct
                        usage of the I/O ports. Contactless communication is done via the contactless interface
                        unit (CIU) compatible to ISO/IEC 14443.
                        The logical interface of the P6022P VB/P6022X VB depends on the CPU mode and the
                        associated software.
                        ‚Ä¢ In Boot Mode the Boot-ROM Software is executed. Only in case the minor configuration
                          option 'Chip Health/Ident Mode' is enabled, starting of built-in self test routines and
                          read-out of TOE identification items is supported. If this minor configuration option
                          is disabled the Boot-ROM Software provides no interface. In this case there is no
                          possibility to interact with this software.
                        ‚Ä¢ In Test Mode (used before TOE delivery) the logical interface visible on the electrical
                          interface is defined by the IC Dedicated Test Software. This IC Dedicated Test
                          Software comprises the test Operating System and the package of test function calls.
                        ‚Ä¢ In Firmware Mode the Firmware Operating System is executed by the CPU. The
                          Firmware Mode is always requested by the Security IC Embedded Software via an
                          FVEC call. Please refer to [9] for more information.
                        ‚Ä¢ In System Mode and User Mode (after TOE Delivery) the software interface is the
                          set of instructions, the bits in the special function registers that are related to these
                          modes and the physical address map of the CPU including memories. The access to
                          the special function registers as well as to the memories depends on the CPU mode
                          configured by the Security IC Embedded Software.
                        Note: The logical interface of the P6022P VB/P6022X VB that is visible on the electrical
                        interface after TOE Delivery is based on the Security IC Embedded Software developed

                      by the software developer. The identification and authentication of the user in System
                      Mode or User Mode must be controlled by the Security IC Embedded Software.
                      The chip surface can be seen as an interface of the P6022P VB/P6022X VB, too. This
                      interface must be taken into account regarding environmental stress e.g. like temperature
                      and in the case of an attack, for which the attacker manipulates the chip surface.
                      Note: An external voltage and timing supply as well as a logical interface are necessary
                      for the operation of the P6022P VB/P6022X VB. Beyond the physical behaviour the
                      logical interface is defined by the Security IC Embedded Software.

                      Section 5.


                 2.2 Package claim
                      This Security Target claims conformance to the assurance package EAL6 augmented for
                      P6022P VB/P6022X VB / P6022M VB/P6022D VB/P6022J VB. The EAL6 is augmented
                      with ALC_FLR.1 and ASE_TSS.2, which is chosen to include architectural information
                      on the security functionality of the TOE. Table 22 summarizes the package claim of this

                      and certified by Bundesamt fuer Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) under the
                      reference BSI-PP-0084-2014" [6].
                      Since the Security Target claims strict conformance to this PP [6], the concepts are used
                      in the same sense. For the definition of terms refer to the PP [6]. These terms also apply
                      to this Security Target.
                      The Security Target includes the packages from the PP [6] and claims conformance as
                      follows:
                      ‚Ä¢ Package ‚ÄúTDES‚Äù (Section 7.4 of PP [6]) Conformant; and
                      ‚Ä¢ Package ‚ÄúAES‚Äù (Section 7.4 of PP [6]) Conformant.
                      The TOE provides additional functionality, which is not covered in the PP [6]. This
                      additional functionality is added using the policy "P.Add-Components-Plain" (see
                      Section 3.3.1 of this Security Target for details).


                 2.4 Conformance claim rationale
                      According to Section 2.3, this Security Target claims strict conformance to the PP
                      ‚ÄúSecurity IC Platform Protection Profile [6].
                      The TOE type defined in Section 1.3.4 of this Security Target is a smartcard controller.
                      This is consistent with the TOE definition for a Security IC in section 1.2.2 of [6].
                      All sections of this Security Target, in which security problem definition, objectives and
                      security requirements are defined, clearly state which of these items are taken from the
                      PP [6] and which are added in this Security Target. Therefore this is not repeated here.
                      Moreover, all additionally stated items in this Security Target do not contradict the items
                      included from the PP (see the respective sections in this document). The operations
                      done for the SFRs taken from the PP [6] are also clearly indicated.
                      The evaluation assurance level claimed for this target (EAL6+ for P6022P VB/P6022X
                      VB/ P6022M VB/ P6022D VB/P6022J VB) is shown in Section 6.2 to include respectively
                      exceed the requirements claimed by the PP [6] (EAL4+).
                      These considerations show that the Security Target correctly claims strict conformance to
                      the PP [6].

3       Security Problem Definition
                          This Security Target claims strict conformance to the PP ‚ÄúSecurity IC Protection Profile‚Äù
                          [6]. Assets, threats, assumptions and organisational security policies are taken from the
                          PP [6]. This chapter lists these assets, threats, assumptions and organisational security
                          policies, and describes extensions to these elements in detail.
                          The chapter is divided into the following sections: "Description of Assets", "Threats",
                          "Organisational Security Policies", and "Assumptions".


                   3.1 Description of Assets


                  3.1.1   NXP Secure Smart Card Controller P6022y VB
                          Since this Security Target claims strict conformance to the PP ‚ÄúSecurity IC Protection
                          Profile‚Äù [6] the assets defined in section 3.1 of [6] are applied here. These assets are
                          cited below.
                          The assets related to standard functionality are:
                          ‚Ä¢ integrity and confidentiality of user data of the Composite TOE being stored in the
                            protected memory areas of the P6022y VB,
                          ‚Ä¢ integrity and confidentiality of Security IC Embedded Software, stored and in operation,
                          ‚Ä¢ correct operation of the security services and restricted hardware resources provided
                            by the P6022y VB for the Security IC Embedded Software.
                          Note the Security IC Embedded Software is user data and shall be protected while being
                          executed/processed and while being stored in the protected memories of the P6022y VB.
                          To be able to protect these assets the P6022y VB shall self-protect its TSF. Critical
                          information about the P6022y VB shall be protected by the development environment
                          and the operational environment. Critical information include:
                          ‚Ä¢ logical design data, physical design data, Security IC Dedicated Software, configuration
                            data,
                          ‚Ä¢ Initialisation Data and Pre-personalisation Data, specific development aids, test and
                            characterisation related data, material for software development support, photomasks.
                          Note that the keys for the cryptographic calculations using cryptographic coprocessors
                          are seen as user data of the Composite TOE.


                   3.2 Threats


                  3.2.1   NXP Secure Smart Card Controller P6022y VB
                          Since this Security Target claims strict conformance to the PP "Security IC Platform
                          Protection Profile" [6] the threats defined in section 3.2 of [6] are valid for this Security
                          Target. The threats defined in the PP [6] are listed below in Table 23.

                      Considering Application Note 4 in [6] the P6022y VB provides additional functionality
                      to protect against threats that may occur if the hardware platform is used for multiple
                      applications. The P6022y VB provides access control to the memories and to hardware
                      resources providing security services for the software.
                      The Security IC Embedded Software controls all user data stored by the P6022y VB. If
                      multiple applications are running on the P6022y VB the user data may belong to different
                      applications. The access to user data from application A by the application B contradicts
                      the separation between the different applications and is considered as threat. The user
                      data is stored in the memory and processed by the hardware resources.
                      The P6022y VB shall avert the threat "Unauthorised Memory or Hardware Access
                      (T.Unauthorised-Access)" as specified below.
                      T.Unauthorised-Access                            Unauthorised Memory or Hardware Access
                      Adverse action:                                  An attacker may try to read, modify or execute code
                                                                       or data stored in restricted memory areas. And or
                                                                       an attacker may try to access or operate hardware
                                                                       resources that are restricted by executing code that
                                                                       accidentally or deliberately accesses these restricted

                      Access restrictions for the memories and hardware resources accessible by the Security
                      IC Embedded Software must be defined and implemented by the security policy of the

               3.3.1   NXP Secure Smart Card Controller P6022y VB
                       Since this Security Target claims strict conformance to the PP "Security IC Platform
                       Protection Profile" [6] the policy P.Process-TOE "Identification during TOE Development
                       and Production" in [6] is applied here as well.
                       The cryptographic security services implement the same organizational security policy
                       but in different extend.
                       P.Crypto-Service                                 Cryptographic services of the TOE
                                                                        The TOE provides secure hardware based cryptographic
                                                                        services for the IC Embedded Software.
                       Note that the P6022y VB provides the following cryptographic services for the IC
                       Embedded Software:
                       ‚Ä¢ Triple-DES encryption and decryption
                       ‚Ä¢ AES encryption and decryption
                       In accordance with Application Note 5 in [6] there are additional policies defined in this
                       Security Target as detailed below.
                       The P6022y VB provides further security functions or security services which can
                       be used by the Security IC Embedded Software. In the following, specific security
                       functionality is listed, which is not derived from threats identified for the environment of
                       the P6022y VB. It can only be decided in the context of the application against which
                       threats the Security IC Embedded Software will use this specific security functionality.
                       The IC Developer/Manufacturer therefore applies the policy "Additional Specific Security
                       Components (P.Add-Components-Plain)" as specified below.

                      Note that the assumption A.Resp-Appl defined in the Protection Profile are relevant for all
                      software running on the hardware platform. The assumptions are still applicable for the
                      Security IC Embedded Software and therefore they will remain in this Security Target as
                      defined in the Protection Profile [6].
                      The following assumptions are added in this Security Target according to Application
                      Notes 6 and 7 in [6].

                 4.2 Security Objectives for the Security IC Embedded Software
                       In this section, the Security Objectives for the Security IC Embedded Software of the
                       TOE P6022y VB are described.
                       In addition to the security objectives for the operational environment as required by CC
                       Part 1 [1] the PP ‚ÄúSecurity IC Protection Profile‚Äù [6] defines security objective for the
                       Security IC Embedded Software which is listed in the table below.

Table 26. Security objectives for the Security IC Embedded Software, taken from the PP [6]

                                      Composite TOE

                       Clarification of "Treatment of user data of the Composite TOE (OE.Resp-Appl)"
                       By definition cipher or plain text data and cryptographic keys are user data of
                       the Composite TOE. The Security IC Embedded Software shall treat these data
                       appropriately, use only proper secret keys (chosen from a large key space) as input for
                       the cryptographic function of the TOE and use keys and functions appropriately in order
                       to ensure the strength of cryptographic operation.
                       This means that keys are treated as confidential as soon as they are generated. The
                       keys must be unique with a very high probability, as well as cryptographically strong. For
                       example, if asymmetric algorithms are used, it must be ensured that it is not possible to
                       derive the private key from a related public key using the attacks defined in this Security

                       All the evaluated configurations of P6022y VB fulfil the Security Functional Requirements
                       of P6022y VB which are presented in Section 6.1.


                 6.2 Security Assurance Requirements

               6.2.1   NXP Secure Smart Card Controller P6022y VB (EAL6+)
                       Table 31 lists all security assurance components that are valid for the P6022y VB. With
                       two exceptions, Table 31 lists all security assurance components that are required by
                       EAL6 (see Section 2.2) or by the PP "Security IC Platform Protection Profile" [6].
                       The exceptions are the components ASE_TSS.2 and ALC_FLR.1. ASE_TSS.2 is chosen
                       as an augmentation to give architectural information on the security functionality of the
                       P6022y VB. ALC_FLR.1 is chosen as an augmentation in this Security Target to cover
                       policies and procedures of the developer applied to track and correct flaws and support
                       surveillance of the P6022y VB.
                       Considering Application Note 22 of [6] the column "Required by" shows the differences in
                       the requirements of security assurance components between the PP [6] and the Security
                       Target for the P6022y VB. The entry "EAL6 / PP" denotes, that an SAR is required by
                       both EAL6 and the requirement of the PP [6], "EAL6" means that this requirement is due
                       to EAL6 and beyond the requirement of the PP [6], and "PP" identifies this component
                       as a requirement of the PP which is beyond EAL6. The augmentations ASE_TSS.2,
                       ALC_FLR.1 are denoted by "EAL6+". The refinements of the PP [6], which must be
                       adapted for EAL6, are described in Section 6.2.1.1.

              6.2.1.1 Refinements of the Security Assurance Requirements for EAL6+
                      The Security Target for the P6022y VB claims strict conformance to the PP [6]
                      and therefore it has to conform to the refinements of the TOE security assurance
                      requirements (see Application Note 23 in [6]). The refinements in the PP [6] are defined
                      for the security assurance components of EAL4+. It needs to be checked if refinements
                      are necessary for assurance components of the higher level EAL6 claimed in the
                      Security Target.
                      Table 32 lists the refinements of the PP [6] for the P6022y VB. Most of the refined
                      security assurance components have the same level in both documents (PP [6] and
                      Security Target). The following five subsections apply the refinements to ALC_CMS.5,
                      ALC_CMC.5, ADV_FSP.5, ADV_IMP.2 and ATE_COV.3 which are different for the PP
                      [6] and the Security Target for the P6022y VB.

[1]   According to Application Note 29 in the PP [6] the Security Target should indicate the version of the document [5] used for the vulnerability analysis. The
      current version is given in the bibliography.

                                 representation‚Äù. Since in ALC_CMS.5, the content and presentation of evidence element
                                 ALC_CMS.5.1C only adds an additional configuration item to the list of items to be
                                 tracked by the CM system, the refinement can be applied without changes.
                                 The refinement of the configuration item ‚ÄúTOE implementation representation‚Äù of

For Polymorphic eMRTD, the PACE protocol is configured with PIN, PUK and CAN
passwords in compliance with [TR-03110-3] during personalisation. Only PACE-

Polymorphic eMRTDs, i.e. the logical data structure does not contain any unique
identifiable data.



1.4.3 TOE life cycle
The TOE life cycle is described in terms of its four life cycle phases. (With respect
to the [SIC-PP], the TOE life-cycle is additionally subdivided into 7 steps in the
ST. These steps are denoted too in the following although the sequence of the
steps differs for the TOE life cycle).

1.4.3.1 Phase 1 ‚ÄúDevelopment‚Äù
(Step1) The TOE is developed in phase 1. The IC developer develops the
integrated circuit, the IC Dedicated Software and the guidance documentation
associated with these TOE components.
The IC developer also acts as the developer of the embedded software (operating
system), which is the NXP JCOP 3 P60.

(Step2) The software developer uses the guidance documentation for the
integrated circuit and the guidance documentation for relevant parts of the NXP
JCOP 3 P60 and develops the ePassport application and the guidance
documentation associated with this TOE component.

The ePassport application (i.e. the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
(SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet run time code) may be
integrated either in ROM or in EEPROM of the chip. Depending on the intention:
      (a) the ePassport application is securely delivered directly from the
          software developer (IDEMIA development dept.) to the IC manufacturer
          (NXP). The applet code will be integrated into the ROM mask code or
          inEEPROM by the IC manufacturer, or
      (b) the ePassport application is securely delivered directly from the
          software developer (IDEMIA development dept.) to the travel document
          manufacturer (IDEMIA production dept.) .) for loading in EEPROM.

Notice that the guidance documentation of the ePassport application is always
securely delivered directly from the software developer (IDEMIA development
dept.) to the travel document manufacturer (IDEMIA production dept.).


1.4.3.2 Phase 2 ‚ÄúManufacturing‚Äù
(Step3) In a first step the TOE integrated circuit is produced containing the travel
document‚Äôs chip Dedicated Software, the parts of the travel document‚Äôs chip
Embedded Software and in case of alternative a) the ePassport application in
ROM or in EEPROM.

The IC manufacturer writes the IC Identification Data onto the chip to control the
IC as travel document material during the IC manufacturing and the delivery
process to the travel document manufacturer. The IC is securely delivered from
the IC manufacturer to the travel document manufacturer.

                           eMRTD Configuration)

If necessary the IC manufacturer adds the parts of the IC Embedded Software in
the non-volatile programmable memories (for instance EEPROM).

(Step4 optional) The travel document manufacturer combines the IC with
hardware for the contact based / contactless interface in the travel document
unless the travel document consist of the chip only.

(Step5) The travel document manufacturer
  i.  adds the IC Embedded Software or part of it in the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM) if necessary and in case
      of alternative (b), loads the ePassport application into the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM),
 ii.      creates the ePassport application and
iii.      equips travel document‚Äôs chips with pre-personalization Data.

EAC PP Application Note 1: Creation of the application for this TOE implies
Applet instantiation.

For this Security Target the following name mappings to the protection profile
[EAC-PP-V2] apply:
   ÔÇ∑ IC Dedicated SW = Low level IC libraries
   ÔÇ∑ travel document‚Äôs chip Embedded Software = NXP JCOP 3 P60 operating
       system.
   ÔÇ∑ ePassport application = IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
       (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet run time code or an
       instantiation of it.
   ÔÇ∑ Pre-personalization Data = Personalization Agent Key Set, Card Production
       Life Cycle (CPLC) data and buffer settings.

Both the underlying platform and IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
(SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet provide configuration and
life-cycle management functions required for TOE preparation. TOE preparation
steps are performed in manufacturing phase and consist of the following 2
activities:
    1. Platform initialisation
       2. Pre-personalisation

Platform initialisation
Platform initialisation consists of the configuration of the NXP JCOP 3 P60 in
accordance with requirements specified in the platform administrator guidance
[PLTF-PRE] by using the dedicated platform commands. Furthermore the Pre-
Personalisation Agent key set is installed and (a part of) the CPLC data is
updated. To prevent unattended tracing of the MRTD document, the NXP JCOP 3
P60 is configured such that unauthenticated access to any platform unique
idenfiable data is not possible.

                              eMRTD Configuration)

Pre-personalisation
The pre-personalisation consists of the following steps:
   a. IC (chip) Authentication and getting chip access with the pre-
      personalisation key set.
   b. [optional] In case the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
      (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet runtime code does
      not reside in ROM, it is loaded into EEPROM.
   c. Install the applet application instances depending on the desired TOE
      configuration specified in section 1.4.2, using IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with
      Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet.
   d. Set the ePassport (and if present) the Polymorphic eMRTD applet
      irreversibly in its PERSONALISATION life-cycle state by installation of the
      Personalisation Agent specific personalisation key set(s).

During step (c) the CPLC data with the IC Identifier as well as the other pre-
personalisation data is configured in the TOE. The last step (d) finalizes the TOE.
This is the moment the TOE starts to exist and is ready for delivery to the
Personalisation Agent. The guidance documentation for the Personalisation Agent
is [AGD_PRE].

The pre-personalised travel document together with the IC Identifier is securely
delivered from the travel document manufacturer to the Personalisation Agent.
The travel document manufacturer also provides the relevant parts of the
guidance documentation [AGD_PRE] and [AGD_OPE] and the Personalisation
Agent Key set to the Personalisation Agent. The following table describes the
physical delivery of the TOE components:

1.4.3.3 Phase 3 ‚ÄúPersonalisation of the travel document‚Äù
(Step 6) The personalisation of the travel document includes
  i.  the survey of the MRTD holder‚Äôs biographical data,
 ii.   the enrolment of the MRTD holder biometric reference data (i.e. the
       digitized portraits and the optional biometric reference data),
iii.   the printing of the visual readable data onto the physical MRTD,
iv.    the writing of the TOE User Data and TSF Data into the logical MRTD and
 v.    configuration of the TSF if necessary.

The step (iv) is performed by the Personalisation Agent and includes but is not
limited to the creation of:
  i.   the digital MRZ data (EF.DG1),
 ii.   the digitized portrait (EF.DG2), and
iii.   the Document security object.

The signing of the Document security object by the Document signer [ICAO-
9303] finalizes the personalisation of the genuine travel document for the travel
document holder. The personalised travel document (together with appropriate
guidance (AGD_OPE) for TOE usage if necessary) is handed over to the travel
document holder for operational use.

The personalisation of Polymorphic eMRTD application instance includes:

 i.    establishing the identity of the polymorphic eMRTD document holder,
 ii.   Requesting the required Polymorphic eMRTD ID attributes from the central
       Key Management authority,
iii.   writing Polymorphic ID attributes, Polymorphic LDS data as defined in
       [PCA-eMRTD],
iv.    writing the TSF data (PIN, PUK, CAv1 private key) as defined in [PCA-
       eMRTD],
 v.    signing the Document Security Object defined in
       [ICAO-9303] (in the role of DS).


The signing of the Document security object by the Document signer [ICAO-
9303] finalizes the personalisation of the genuine Polymorphic eMRTD document
for the travel document holder. The personalised Polymorphic eMRTD document
(together with appropriate guidance (AGD_OPE) for TOE usage if necessary) is
handed over to the Polymorphic eMRTD document holder for operational use.

Authentication trust anchor, the effective date and the Chip Authentication
Private Key.

EAC PP Application note 3: This ST distinguishes between the Personalisation
Agent as entity known to the TOE and the Document Signer as entity in the TOE
IT environment signing the Document security object as described in [ICAO-
9303]. This approach allows but does not enforce the separation of these roles.


1.4.3.4 Phase 4 ‚ÄúOperational Use‚Äù
(Step 7) The TOE is used as a travel document's chip by the traveller and the
inspection systems in the ‚ÄúOperational Use‚Äù phase. The user data can be read
according to the security policy of the issuing State or Organisation and can be
used according to the security policy of the issuing State but they can never be
modified.

EAC PP Application note 42: The intention of the ST is to consider at least the
phases 1 and parts of phase 2 (i.e. Step1 to Step3) as part of the evaluation and
therefore to define the TOE delivery according to CC after this phase. Since
specific production steps of phase 2 are of minor security relevance (e.g. booklet
manufacturing and antenna integration) these are not part of the CC evaluation
under ALC. Nevertheless the decision about this has to be taken by the
certification body resp. the national body of the issuing State or Organisation. In
this case the national body of the issuing State or Organisation is responsible for
these specific production steps.
Note that the personalisation process and its environment may depend on
specific security needs of an issuing State or Organisation. All production,
generation and installation procedures after TOE delivery up to the ‚ÄúOperational
Use‚Äù (phase 4) have to be considered in the product evaluation process under
AGD assurance class. Therefore, the Security Target outlines the split up of
P.Manufact, P.Personalisation and the related security objectives into aspects
relevant before vs. after TOE delivery.


1.4.3.5 Non-TOE hardware/software/firmware required by the TOE
There is no explicit non-TOE hardware, software or firmware required by the TOE
to perform its claimed security features. The TOE is defined to comprise the chip
and the complete operating system and application. Note, the inlay holding the
chip as well as the antenna and the booklet (holding the printed MRZ) are
needed to represent a complete travel document. Nevertheless, these parts are
not inevitable for the secure operation of the TOE.




2
 For this ST all steps of both phase 1 and phase 2 are part of the evaluation and therefore define the TOE
delivery according to the CC evaluation after this phase.

2.3 Package Claim
This ST is conforming to assurance package EAL5 augmented with ALC_DVS.2
and AVA_VAN.5 defined in CC part 3 [CC-3].


2.4 PP Conformance Rationale
This ST claims strict conformance to [EAC-PP-V2]. According to hints in [EAC-PP-
V2] parts of the [PACE-PP] have been included into this ST. A detailed
justification is given in the following.


2.4.1 Main aspects
-   The TOE description (chapter 1.3) is based on the TOE definition and TOE
    usage of [EAC-PP, 1.1]. It was enhanced by product specific details.

-   All definitions of the security problem definition in [EAC-PP, 3] have been
    taken exactly from the protection profile in the same wording.

-   All security objectives have been taken exactly from [EAC-PP, 4] in the same
    wording, except for OT.Chip_Auth_Proof which is enhanced to support
    Active Authentication.

-   The part of extended components definition has been taken originally from
    [EAC-PP, 5].

-   All SFRs for the TOE have been taken originally from the [EAC-PP, 6.1] added
    by according iterations, selections and assignments.

-   The security assurance requirements (SARs) have been taken originally from
    the EAC-PP. The requirements are shifted to those of EAL 5+.


2.4.2 Overview of differences between the PP and the ST

The Active Authentication has been added to the TOE. For that:
- One assumption has been added to cover Active Authentication during
   personalization: A.Pers_Agent_AA
- Two security objectives for the environment have been added:
   OE.Auth_Key_MRTD and OE.AA_MRTD. These additions to the original
   objectives of the PP do not contradict with any other objective nor mitigate a
   threat (or part of a threat) meant to be addressed by security objectives for
   the TOE in the PP.
- Three security functional requirements have been added:
             ÔÇ∑ FCS_COP.1/SIG_GEN
             ÔÇ∑   FIA_API.1/AA
             ÔÇ∑   FMT_MTD.1/AAPK

                        eMRTD Configuration)

The additional functionality of Password Authenticated Connection Establishment
with Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE-CAM) has been added to the TOE. It
possesses the same security requirements as the PACE functionality, which
means that the same security problem definition is applicable for PACE-CAM.


The following additional SFRs have been defined for PACE-CAM:
             ÔÇ∑ FIA_UID.1/PACE_CAM
             ÔÇ∑   FIA_UAU.1/PACE_CAM
             ÔÇ∑   FIA_UAU.4/PACE_CAM
             ÔÇ∑   FIA_UAU.5/PACE_CAM
             ÔÇ∑   FIA_UAU.6/PACE_CAM

             ÔÇ∑   FMT_MTD.1/PACE_CAM_KEY_WRITE




The additional functionality of the Polymorphic eMRTD extensions has been
added to the TOE with: (i) additional security problem definition; (ii) additional
security objectives; (iii) additional SFRs. Notice that many SFRs are included
from the [EACv2-PP].

3 Security Problem Definition

3.1 Assets
The assets to be protected by the TOE include the User Data on the travel

3.3.2 Additional Threats

T.Read_Sensitive_Data
  Read the sensitive biometric reference data
  Adverse action: An attacker tries to gain the sensitive biometric reference data
  through the communication interface of the travel document‚Äôs chip.
  The attack T.Read_Sensitive_Data is similar to the threat T.Skimming (cf.
  [PP_BAC]) in respect of the attack path (communication interface) and the
  motivation (to get data stored on the travel document‚Äôs chip) but differs from
  those in the asset under the attack (sensitive biometric reference data vs.
  digital MRZ, digitized portrait and other data), the opportunity (i.e. knowing
  the PACE Password) and therefore the possible attack methods. Note, that the
  sensitive biometric reference data are stored only on the travel document‚Äôs
  chip as private sensitive personal data whereas the MRZ data and the portrait
  are visually readable on the physical part of the travel document as well.
  Threat agent: having high attack potential, knowing the PACE Password, being
  in possession of a legitimate travel document.
  Asset: confidentiality of logical travel document sensitive user data (i.e.
  biometric reference)

P.Pre-Operational_Polymorphic
  Pre-operational handling of the polymorphic eMRTD document
     1) The polymorphic eMRTD document Issuer issues the polymorphic
        eMRTD document and approves it using the terminals and
        authentication services complying with all applicable laws and
        regulations.
     2) The polymorphic eMRTD document Issuer guarantees correctness of the
        PI/PP/CPI data stored in the TOE.
     3) The polymorphic eMRTD document Issuer uses only such TOE's
        technical components (IC) which enable traceability of the polymorphic
        eMRTD documents in their manufacturing and issuing life cycle phases,
        i.e. before they are in the operational phase.
     4) If the polymorphic eMRTD document Issuer authorises a Personalisation
        Agent to personalise the polymorphic eMRTD document for polymorphic
        eMRTD document holders, the polymorphic eMRTD document Issuer has
        to ensure that the Personalisation Agent acts in accordance with the
        polymorphic eMRTD document Issuer's policy.
     5) The Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer shall ensure that the
        PP/PI/CPI data are generated and stored securely in the Polymorphic
        eMRTD document.
     6) The Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer shall establish a public key
        infrastructure for the card verifiable certificates used for Terminal
        Authentication v1. For this aim, the Polymorphic eMRTD document
        issuer shall run a Country Verifying Certification Authority. The PKI shall
        fulfill the requirements and rules of the corresponding certificate policy.
        The Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer shall make the CVCA
        certificate available to the personalization agent or the manufacturer.
  Application Note:
  This OSP is an extension of the OSP 'P.Pre-Operational' defined in [PACE-PP].

3.5 Assumptions
The assumptions describe the security aspects of the environment in which the
TOE will be used or is intended to be used.

3.5.1 Assumptions listed in PP PACE

A.Passive_Auth
  PKI for Passive Authentication The issuing and receiving States or
  Organisations establish a public key infrastructure for passive authentication
  i.e. digital signature creation and verification for the logical travel document.
  The issuing State or Organisation runs a Certification Authority (CA) which
  securely generates, stores and uses the Country Signing CA Key pair. The CA
  keeps the Country Signing CA Private Key secret and is recommended to
  distribute the Country Signing CA Public Key to ICAO, all receiving States
  maintaining its integrity. The Document Signer (i) generates the Document
  Signer Key Pair,(ii) hands over the Document Signer Public Key to the CA for
  certification, (iii) keeps the Document Signer Private Key secret and (iv) uses
  securely the Document Signer Private Key for signing the Document Security
  Objects of the travel documents. The CA creates the Document Signer
  Certificates for the Document Signer Public Keys that are distributed to the
  receiving States and Organisations. It is assumed that the Personalisation
  Agent ensures that the Document Security Object contains only the hash
  values of genuine user data according to [ICAO-9303].



3.5.2 Assumptions listed in PP EAC

A.Insp_Sys
  Inspection Systems for global interoperability The Extended Inspection
  System (EIS) for global interoperability includes the Country Signing CA Public
  Key and implements the terminal part of PACE [ICAO-9303] part 11 and/or
  BAC [BAC-PP]. BAC may only be used if supported by the TOE. If both PACE
  and BAC are supported by the TOE and the IS, PACE must be used. The EIS
  reads the logical travel document under PACE or BAC and performs the Chip
  Authentication v.1 to verify the logical travel document and establishes secure
  messaging. EIS supports the Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 in order to
  ensure access control and is authorized by the issuing State or Organisation

  through the Document Verifier of the receiving State to read the sensitive
  biometric reference data.
  Justification: The assumption A.Insp_Sys does not confine the security
  objectives of the [PACE-PP] as it repeats the requirements of P.Terminal and
  adds only assumptions for the Inspection Systems for handling the EAC
  functionality of the TOE.

A.Auth_PKI
  PKI for Inspection Systems The issuing and receiving States or
  Organisations establish a public key infrastructure for card verifiable
  certificates of the Extended Access Control. The Country Verifying Certification
  Authorities, the Document Verifier and Extended Inspection Systems hold
  authentication key pairs and certificates for their public keys encoding the
  access control rights. The Country Verifying Certification Authorities of the
  issuing States or Organisations are signing the certificates of the Document
  Verifier and the Document Verifiers are signing the certificates of the Extended
  Inspection Systems of the receiving States or Organisations. The issuing
  States or Organisations distribute the public keys of their Country Verifying
  Certification Authority to their travel document‚Äôs chip.
  Justification: This assumption only concerns the EAC part of the TOE. The
  issuing and use of card verifiable certificates of the Extended Access Control is
  neither relevant for the PACE part of the TOE nor will the security objectives of
  the [PACE-PP] be restricted by this assumption. For the EAC functionality of
  the TOE the assumption is necessary because it covers the pre-requisite for
  performing the Terminal Authentication Protocol Version 1.



3.5.3 Assumptions related to Active Authentication

A.Pers_Agent_AA
     Personalization of the MRTD‚Äôs chip (Active Authentication) The
     Personalization Agent ensures the correctness of the Active Authentication
     Public Key (EF.DG15) if stored on the MRTD‚Äôs chip.

A.Polymorphic_Auth
  It assumed that:
      o All authentication infrastructure keys used by the central Key
          Management       Authority     for   the    polymorphic    authentication
          infrastructure (generation and transformation of PP, PI and CPI) are
          generated, handled and stored securely.
      o The PP/PI/CPI are generated securely by the central Key Management
          Authority of the polymorphic authentication infrastructure and stored
          securely in the eMRTD polymorphic chip during the personalization
          phase.
      o The TOE communicates only with Trustworthy Authentication
          Service/Terminal during the Polymorphic Authentication.
      o The randomised PP, PI and CPI are securely received by Polymorphic
          Authentication Service/Terminal. The randomised PP, PI and CPI are
          transformed (‚Äúre-keyed‚Äù) by the central Key Management Authority
          (i.e. ElGamal re-encryption of the randomized PP, PI and/or CPI using
          the public key of Service Provider, who has is authorized to read the
          plain value of identifying user attributes included in the PP, PI or CPI).
          Identification by the identifying user attributes contained inside the PP,
          PI and CPI takes place at the Service Provider.
  Application Note:
  This Assumption has been added to this ST for the polymorphic authentication
  infrastructure. This addition does not conflict with the strict conformance to
  PACE PP [PACE-PP] and EACv1 PP [EAC-PP-V2].

A.Auth_PKI_Polymorphic
  PKI for Polymorphic eMRTD It is assumed that:
     o The issuing States or Organisations establisguidance
documentation associated with this TOE component.

The ePassport application (i.e. the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
(SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet run time code) may be
integrated either in ROM or in EEPROM of the chip. Depending on the intention:
      (a) the ePassport application is securely delivered directly from the
          software developer (IDEMIA development dept.) to the IC manufacturer
          (NXP). The applet code will be integrated into the ROM mask code or
          inEEPROM by the IC manufacturer, or
      (b) the ePassport application is securely delivered directly from the
          software developer (IDEMIA development dept.) to the travel document
          manufacturer (IDEMIA production dept.) .) for loading in EEPROM.

Notice that the guidance documentation of the ePassport application is always
securely delivered directly from the software developer (IDEMIA development
dept.) to the travel document manufacturer (IDEMIA production dept.).


1.4.3.2 Phase 2 ‚ÄúManufacturing‚Äù
(Step3) In a first step the TOE integrated circuit is produced containing the travel
document‚Äôs chip Dedicated Software, the parts of the travel document‚Äôs chip
Embedded Software and in case of alternative a) the ePassport application in
ROM or in EEPROM.

The IC manufacturer writes the IC Identification Data onto the chip to control the
IC as travel document material during the IC manufacturing and the delivery
process to the travel document manufacturer. The IC is securely delivered from
the IC manufacturer to the travel document manufacturer.

                           eMRTD Configuration)

If necessary the IC manufacturer adds the parts of the IC Embedded Software in
the non-volatile programmable memories (for instance EEPROM).

(Step4 optional) The travel document manufacturer combines the IC with
hardware for the contact based / contactless interface in the travel document
unless the travel document consist of the chip only.

(Step5) The travel document manufacturer
  i.  adds the IC Embedded Software or part of it in the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM) if necessary and in case
      of alternative (b), loads the ePassport application into the non-volatile
      programmable memories (for instance EEPROM),
 ii.      creates the ePassport application and
iii.      equips travel document‚Äôs chips with pre-personalization Data.

EAC PP Application Note 1: Creation of the application for this TOE implies
Applet instantiation.

For this Security Target the following name mappings to the protection profile
[EAC-PP-V2] apply:
   ÔÇ∑ IC Dedicated SW = Low level IC libraries
   ÔÇ∑ travel document‚Äôs chip Embedded Software = NXP JCOP 3 P60 operating
       system.
   ÔÇ∑ ePassport application = IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
       (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet run time code or an
       instantiation of it.
   ÔÇ∑ Pre-personalization Data = Personalization Agent Key Set, Card Production
       Life Cycle (CPLC) data and buffer settings.

Both the underlying platform and IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
(SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) Applet provide configuration and
life-cycle management functions required for TOE preparation. TOE preparation
steps are performed in manufacturing phase and consist of the following 2
activities:
    1. Platform initialisation
       2. Pre-personalisation

Platform initialisation
Platform initialisation consists of the configuration of the NXP JCOP 3 P60 in
accordance with requirements specified in the platform administrator guidance
[PLTF-PRE] by using the dedicated platform commands. Furthermore the Pre-
Personalisation Agent key set is installed and (a part of) the CPLC data is
updated. To prevent unattended tracing of the MRTD document, the NXP JCOP 3
P6´ is configured such that unauthenticated access to any platform unique
idenfiable data is not possible.

                              eMRTD Configuration)

Pre-personalisation
The pre-personalisation consists of the following steps:
   a. IC (chip) Authentication and getting chip access with the pre-
      personalisation key set.
   b. [optional] In case the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
      (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet runtime code does
      not reside in ROM, it is loaded into EEPROM.
   c. Install the applet application instances depending on the desired TOE
      configuration specified in section 1.4.2, using IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with
      Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) applet.
   d. Set the ePassport (and if present) the Polymorphic eMRTD applet
      irreversibly in its PERSONALISATION life-cycle state by installation of the
      Personalisation Agent specific personalisation key set(s).

During step (c) the CPLC data with the IC Identifier as well as the other pre-
personalisation data is configured in the TOE. The last step (d) finalizes the TOE.
This is the moment the TOE starts to exist and is ready for delivery to the
Personalisation Agent. The guidance documentation for the Personalisation Agent
is [AGD_PRE].

The pre-personalised travel document together with the IC Identifier is securely
delivered from the travel document manufacturer to the Personalisation Agent.
The travel document manufacturer also provides the relevant parts of the
guidance documentation [AGD_PRE] and [AGD_OPE] and the Personalisation
Agent Key set to the Personalisation Agent. The following table describes the
physical delivery of the TOE components:

(Step 6) The personalisation of the travel document includes
  i.  the survey of the MRTD holder‚Äôs biographical data,
 ii.   the enrolment of the MRTD holder biometric reference data (i.e. the
       digitized portraits and the optional biometric reference data),
iii.   the printing of the visual readable data onto the physical MRTD,
iv.    the writing of the TOE User Data and TSF Data into the logical MRTD and
 v.    configuration of the TSF if necessary.

The step (iv) is performed by the Personalisation Agent and includes but is not
limited to the creation of:
  i.   the digital MRZ data (EF.DG1),
 ii.   the digitized portrait (EF.DG2), and
iii.   the Document security object.

The signing of the Document security object by the Document signer [ICAO-

       required to execute PACE with PIN, Passive Authentication (PA), CAv1,
       TAv1 authentication according to [TR-03110-2] and Polymorphic
       Authentication (PMA). They are assumed to securely store static IS
       private keys and generate secure temporary session keys and nonces.
    o The Document Verifier authorizes Polymorphic Inspection Systems by
       creation of Inspection System Certificates for access to polymorphic
       user data stored the polymorphic eMRTD document. An Polymorphic
       Inspection Systems authenticates itselve to the polymorphic eMRTD

4.2 Security Objectives for the Operational Environment


4.2.1 Issuing State or Organisation
The Issuing State or Organization will implement the following security objectives
of the TOE environment.


OE.Legislative_Compliance
  Issuing of the travel document
  The travel document Issuer must issue the travel document and approve it
  using the terminals complying with all applicable laws and regulations.

OE.Auth_Key_Travel_Document
  Travel document Authentication Key
  The issuing State or Organisation has to establish the necessary public key
  infrastructure in order to (i) generate the travel document‚Äôs Chip
  Authentication Key Pair, (ii) sign and store the Chip Authentication Public Key

  The issuing State or Organisation has to establish the necessary public key
  infrastructure in order to limit the access to sensitive biometric reference data
  of travel document holders to authorized receiving States or Organisations.
  The Country Verifying Certification Authority of the issuing State or
  Organisation generates card verifiable Document Verifier Certificates for the
  authorized Document Verifier only.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Read_Sensitive_Data, the Organisational Security Policy P.Sensitive_Data
  and the Assumption A.Auth_PKI as it specifies the pre-requisite for the
  Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 as it concerns the need of an PKI for this
  protocol and the responsibilities of its root instance. The Terminal
  Authentication Protocol v.1 is one of the additional features of the TOE
  described only in [EAC-PP-V2] and not in [PACE-PP].

4.2.2 Travel document Issuer and CSCA: travel document PKI
(issuing) branch
The travel document Issuer and the related CSCA will implement the following
security objectives for the TOE environment:


OE.Passive_Auth_Sign
  Authentication of travel document by Signature.
  The travel document Issuer has to establish the necessary public key
  infrastructure as follows: the CSCA acting on behalf and according to the
  policy of the travel document Issuer must

          secure operational environment only.
  The digital signature in the Document Security Object relates to all hash
  values for each data group in use according to [ICAO-9303].The
  Personalisation Agent has to ensure that the Document Security Object
  contains only the hash values of genuine user data according to [ICAO-9303].
  The CSCA must issue its certificates exclusively to the rightful organisations
  (DS) and DSs must sign exclusively correct Document Security Objects to be
  stored on travel document.

OE.Personalisation
  Personalisation of travel document
  The travel document Issuer must ensure that the Personalisation Agents
  acting on his behalf
      (i) establish the correct identity of the travel document holder and create
          the biographical data for the travel document,
      (ii) enroll the biometric reference data of the travel document holder,
      (iii) write a subset of these data on the physical Passport (optical
          personalisation) and store them in the travel document (electronic
          personalisation) for the travel document holder as defined in [ICAO-
          9303],
      (iv) write the document details data,
      (v) write the initial TSF data,

          of a DS).

4.2.3 Terminal operator: Terminal receiving branch

OE.Terminal
  Terminal operating
  The terminal operators must operate their terminals as follows:
     1.) The related terminals (basic inspection systems, cf. above) are used by
        terminal operators and by travel document holders as defined in [ICAO-
        9303].
     2.) The related terminals implement the terminal parts of the PACE
        protocol [ICAO-9303] part 11, of the Passive Authentication [ICAO-
        9303] part 11 (by verification of the signature of the Document Security

         and (almost) uniformly selected nonces, if required by the protocols (for
         generating ephemeral keys for Diffie-Hellmann).
      3.) The related terminals need not to use any own credentials.
      4.) The related terminals securely store the Country Signing Public Key
         and the Document Signer Public Key (in form of CCSCA and CDS) in
         order to enable and to perform Passive Authentication of the travel
         document (determination of the authenticity of data groups stored in
         the travel document, [ICAO-9303] part 12).
      5.) The related terminals and their environment must ensure
         confidentiality and integrity of respective data handled by them (e.g.
         confidentiality of the PACE passwords, integrity of PKI certificates, etc.),
         where it is necessary for a secure operation of the TOE according to the
         current PP.

4.2.4 Travel document holder Obligations

OE.Travel_Document_Holder
  Travel document holder Obligations
  The travel document holder may reveal, if necessary, his or her verification
  values of the PACE password to an authorized person or device who definitely
  act according to respective regulations and are trustworthy.

4.2.5 Receiving State or Organisation

OE.Exam_Travel_Document
  Examination of the physical part of the travel document
  The inspection system of the receiving State or Organisation must examine
  the travel document presented by the traveler to verify its authenticity by
  means of the physical security measures and to detect any manipulation of the
  physical part of the travel document. The Basic Inspection System for global
  interoperability (i) includes the Country Signing CA Public Key and the
  Document Signer Public Key of each issuing State or Organisation, and (ii)
  implements the terminal part of PACE [ICAO-9303] part 11 and/or the Basic
  Access Control [ICAO-9303]. Extended Inspection Systems perform
  additionally to these points the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1 to verify
  the Authenticity of the presented travel document‚Äôs chip.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Counterfeit and the Assumption A.Insp_Sys by demanding the Inspection
  System       to     perform     the     Chip     Authentication     protocolv.1.
  OE.Exam_Travel_Document also repeats partly the requirements from
  OE.Terminal in [PACE-PP] and therefore also counters T.Forgery and A.
  Passive_Auth from [PACE-PP]. This is done because a new type of Inspection
  System is introduced in this PP as the Extended Inspection System is needed

      to handle the additional features of a travel document with Extended Access
      Control.


OE.AA_MRTD
      Active Authentication - Inspection Systems5
      An Active Authentication (Basic, General or Extended) Inspection system
      performs all the functions of the Basic, General and Extended Inspection
      System, and verifies the IC authenticity with an RSA or ECDSA signature
      generated by the MRTD (if available).



OE.Prot_Logical_Travel_Document
  Protection of data from the logical travel document
  The inspection system of the receiving State or Organisation ensures the
  confidentiality and integrity of the data read from the logical travel document.
  The inspection system will prevent eavesdropping to their communication with
  the TOE before secure messaging is successfully established based on the Chip
  Authentication Protocol Version 1.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP]in order to handle the Assumption
  A.Insp_Sys by requiring the Inspection System to perform secure messaging
  based on the Chip Authentication Protocol v.1.

OE.Ext_Insp_Systems
  Authorization of Extended Inspection Systems
  The Document Verifier of receiving States or Organisations authorizes
  Extended Inspection Systems by creation of Inspection System Certificates for
  access to sensitive biometric reference data of the logical travel document.
  The Extended Inspection System authenticates themselves to the travel
  document‚Äôs chip for access to the sensitive biometric reference data with its
  private Terminal Authentication Key and its Inspection System Certificate.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Read_Sensitive_Data, the Organisational Security Policy P.Sensitive_Data
  and the Assumption A. Auth_PKI as it specifies the pre-requisite for the
  Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 as it concerns the responsibilities of the
  Document Verifier and the Inspection Systems.

4.3 Security Objectives Rationale

4.3.1 Threats

4.3.1.1 Threats listed in PP PACE

T.Skimming addresses accessing the User Data (stored on the TOE or
  transferred between the TOE and the terminal) using the TOE's
  contactless/contact interface. This threat is countered by the security
  objectives        OT.Data_Integrity,        OT.Data_Authenticity        and
  OT.Data_Confidentiality through the PACE authentication. The objective
  OE.Travel_Document_Holder ensures that a PACE session can only be
  established either by the travel document holder itself or by an authorised
  person or device, and, hence, cannot be captured by an attacker.

T.Eavesdropping addresses listening to the communication between the TOE
  and a rightful terminal in order to gain the User Data transferred there. This
  threat is countered by the security objective OT.Data_Confidentiality through a
  trusted channel based on the PACE authentication.

T.Tracing addresses gathering TOE tracing data identifying it remotely by
  establishing or listening to a communication via the contactless/contact
  interface of the TOE, whereby the attacker does not a priori know the correct
  values of the PACE password. This threat is directly countered by security
  objectives    OT.Tracing   (no    gathering   TOE     tracing    data)   and
  OE.Travel_Document_Holder (the attacker does not a priori know the correct
  values of the shared passwords).

T.Forgery 'Forgery of data' addresses the fraudulent, complete or partial
  alteration of the User Data or/and TSF-data stored on the TOE or/and
  exchanged between the TOE and the terminal. Additionally to the security
  objectives from PACE PP [PACE-PP] which counter this threat, the examination
  of     the     presented   MRTD       passport    book       according    to
  OE.Exam_Travel_Document 'Examination of the physical part of the travel
  document' shall ensure its authenticity by means of the physical security
  measures and detect any manipulation of the physical part of the travel
  document.
  The threat T.Forgery also addresses the fraudulent, complete or partial
  alteration of the User Data or/and TSF-data stored on the TOE or/and
                        Security Target Lite
                                                                    Ref.:

                       eMRTD Configuration)

  exchanged between the TOE and the terminal. The security objective
  OT.AC_Pers requires the TOE to limit the write access for the travel document
  to the trustworthy Personalisation Agent (cf. OE.Personalisation). The TOE will
  protect the integrity and authenticity of the stored and exchanged User Data
  or/and TSF-data as aimed by the security objectives OT.Data_Integrity and
  OT.Data_Authenticity, respectively. The objectives OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper and
  OT.Prot_Abuse-Func contribute to protecting integrity of the User Data or/and
  TSF-data stored on the TOE. A terminal operator operating his terminals
  according to OE.Terminal and performing the Passive Authentication using the
  Document Security Object as aimed by OE.Passive_Auth_Sign will be able to
  effectively verify integrity and authenticity of the data received from the TOE.

T.Abuse-Func addresses attacks of misusing TOE's functionality to manipulate
  or to disclosure the stored User- or TSF-data as well as to disable or to bypass
  the soft-coded security functionality. The security objective OT.Prot_Abuse-
  Func ensures that the usage of functions having not to be used in the
  operational phase is effectively prevented.

T.Information_Leakage is typical for integrated circuits like smart cards under
  direct attack with high attack potential. The protection of the TOE against this
  threat is obviously addressed by the directly related security objective
  OT.Prot_Inf_Leak.

T.Phys-Tamper is typical for integrated circuits like smart cards under direct
  attack with high attack potential. The protection of the TOE against this threat
  is obviously addressed by the directly related security objective OT.Prot_Phys-
  Tamper.

T.Malfunction is typical for integrated circuits like smart cards under direct
  attack with high attack potential. The protection of the TOE against this threat
  is obviously addressed by the directly related security objective
  OT.Prot_Malfunction.

4.3.1.2 Additional Threats

T.Read_Sensitive_Data The threat T.Read_Sensitive_Data 'Read the sensitive
  biometric    reference   data'    is  countered     by    the   TOE-objective
  OT.Sens_Data_Conf 'Confidentiality of sensitive biometric reference data'
  requiring that read access to EF.DG3 and EF.DG4 (containing the sensitive
  biometric reference data) is only granted to authorized inspection systems.
  Furthermore it is required that the transmission of these data ensures the
  data's confidentiality. The authorization bases on Document Verifier
  certificates issued by the issuing State or Organisation as required by
  OE.Authoriz_Sens_Data 'Authorization for use of sensitive biometric reference
  data'. The Document Verifier of the receiving State has to authorize Extended
  Inspection Systems by creating appropriate Inspection System certificates for

  access to the sensitive biometric reference data as demanded                by
  OE.Ext_Insp_Systems 'Authorization of Extended Inspection Systems'.

T.Counterfeit 'Counterfeit of travel document chip data' addresses the attack of
  unauthorized copy or reproduction of the genuine travel document's chip. This
  attack is thwarted by chip an identification and authenticity proof required by
  OT.Chip_Auth_Proof 'Proof of travel document's chip authentication' using an
  authentication key pair to be generated by the issuing State or Organisation.
  The Public Chip Authentication Key has to be written into EF.DG14 and signed
  by    means     of  Documents       Security    Objects    as   demanded     by
  OE.Auth_Key_Travel_Document 'Travel document Authentication Key'.
  According to OE.Exam_Travel_Document 'Examination of the physical part of
  the travel document' the General Inspection system has to perform the Chip
  Authentication Protocol Version 1 to verify the authenticity of the travel
  document's chip. Moreover, the Active Authentication Public Key has to be
  written into EF.DG15 as demanded by OE.Auth_Key_MRTD 'MRTD
  Authentication Key'. According to OE.AA_MRTD 'Active Authentication -
  Inspection Systems' the Inspection system has to perform the Active
  Authentication Protocol to verify the authenticity of the MRTD‚Äôs chip.

4.3.2.1 OSP listed in PP PACE

P.Manufact requires a unique identification of the IC by means of the
  Initialization Data and the writing of the Pre-personalisation Data as being
  fulfilled by OT.Identification.

P.Pre-Operational is enforced by the following security objectives:
  OT.Identification is affine to the OSP's property 'traceability before the
  operational phase; OT.AC_Pers and OE.Personalisation together enforce the
  OSP's properties 'correctness of the User and the TSF-data stored' and
  'authorisation of Personalisation Agents'; OE.Legislative_Compliance is affine
  to the OSP's property 'compliance with laws and regulations'.

P.Card_PKI is enforced by establishing the issuing PKI branch as aimed by the
  objectives OE.Passive_Auth_Sign (for the Document Security Object).

P.Trustworthy_PKI is enforced by OE.Passive_Auth_Sign (for CSCA, issuing
  PKI branch).

P.Terminal 'Abilities and trustworthiness of terminals' is countered by the

  to ensure the authenticity of the polymorphic eMRTD PI/PP/CPI data. This
  extension does not conflict with the strict conformance to PACE and EACv1
  PPs.

OT.Polymorphic_Data_Privacy
  Privacy of eMRTD polymorphic user data
  The TOE guarantees the privacy of the PI, PP and optional CPI user data by
  randomising the PI, PP and optional CPI user data during the polymorphic
  authentication (PMA), prior to returning it to the authorised Polymorphic
  Authentication Terminal/Service. This prevents the Authenication Service from
  being able to harvest any user or card unique identifiable data.
  Application Note:
  This OT has been added to this ST to ensure and maintain the privacy of the
  polymorphic     PI, PP and optional CPI user data during the Polymorphic
  Authentication (sequence of PACE with PIN, CAv1, TAv1 and PMA). This
  addition does not conflict with the strict conformance to PACE and EACv1 PPs.

OT.AC_Pers_Polymorphic

          secure operational environment only.
  The digital signature in the Document Security Object relates to all hash
  values for each data group in use according to [ICAO-9303].The
  Personalisation Agent has to ensure that the Document Security Object
  contains only the hash values of genuine user data according to [ICAO-9303].
  The CSCA must issue its certificates exclusively to the rightful organisations
  (DS) and DSs must sign exclusively correct Document Security Objects to be
  stored on travel document.

OE.Personalisation
  Personalisation of travel document
  The travel document Issuer must ensure that the Personalisation Agents
  acting on his behalf
      (i) establish the correct identity of the travel document holder and create
          the biographical data for the travel document,
      (ii) enroll the biometric reference data of the travel document holder,
      (iii) write a subset of these data on the physical Passport (optical
          personalisation) and store them in the travel document (electronic
          personalisation) for the travel document holder as defined in [ICAO-

         and (almost) uniformly selected nonces, if required by the protocols (for
         generating ephemeral keys for Diffie-Hellmann).
      3.) The related terminals need not to use any own credentials.
      4.) The related terminals securely store the Country Signing Public Key
         and the Document Signer Public Key (in form of CCSCA and CDS) in
         order to enable and to perform Passive Authentication of the travel
         document (determination of the authenticity of data groups stored in
         the travel document, [ICAO-9303] part 12).
      5.) The related terminals and their environment must ensure
         confidentiality and integrity of respective data handled by them (e.g.
         confidentiality of the PACE passwords, integrity of PKI certificates, etc.),
         where it is necessary for a secure operation of the TOE according to the
         current PP.

4.2.4 Travel document holder Obligations

OE.Travel_Document_Holder
  Travel document holder Obligations
  The travel document holder may reveal, if necessary, his or her verification
  values of the PACE password to an authorized person or device who definitely
  act according to respective regulations and are trustworthy.

4.2.5 Receiving State or Organisation

OE.Exam_Travel_Document
  Examination of the physical part of the travel document
  The inspection system of the receiving State or Organisation must examine
  the travel document presented by the traveler to verify its authenticity by
  means of the physical security measures and to detect any manipulation of the
  physical part of the travel document. The Basic Inspection System for global
  interoperability (i) includes the Country Signing CA Public Key and the
  Document Signer Public Key of each issuing State or Organisation, and (ii)
  implements the terminal part of PACE [ICAO-9303] part 11 and/or the Basic
  Access Control [ICAO-9303]. Extended Inspection Systems perform
  additionally to these points the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1 to verify
  the Authenticity of the presented travel document‚Äôs chip.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Counterfeit and the Assumption A.Insp_Sys by demanding the Inspection
  System       to     perform     the     Chip     Authentication     protocolv.1.
  OE.Exam_Travel_Document also repeats partly the requirements from
  OE.Terminal in [PACE-PP] and therefore also counters T.Forgery and A.
  Passive_Auth from [PACE-PP]. This is done because a new type of Inspection

      Active Authentication - Inspection Systems5
      An Active Authentication (Basic, General or Extended) Inspection system
      performs all the functions of the Basic, General and Extended Inspection
      System, and verifies the IC authenticity with an RSA or ECDSA signature
      generated by the MRTD (if available).



OE.Prot_Logical_Travel_Document
  Protection of data from the logical travel document
  The inspection system of the receiving State or Organisation ensures the
  confidentiality and integrity of the data read from the logical travel document.
  The inspection system will prevent eavesdropping to their communication with
  the TOE before secure messaging is successfully established based on the Chip
  Authentication Protocol Version 1.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP]in order to handle the Assumption
  A.Insp_Sys by requiring the Inspection System to perform secure messaging
  based on the Chip Authentication Protocol v.1.

OE.Ext_Insp_Systems
  Authorization of Extended Inspection Systems
  The Document Verifier of receiving States or Organisations authorizes
  Extended Inspection Systems by creation of Inspection System Certificates for
  access to sensitive biometric reference data of the logical travel document.
  The Extended Inspection System authenticates themselves to the travel
  document‚Äôs chip for access to the sensitive biometric reference data with its
  private Terminal Authentication Key and its Inspection System Certificate.
  Justification: This security objective for the operational environment is
  needed additionally to those from [PACE-PP] in order to handle the Threat
  T.Read_Sensitive_Data, the Organisational Security Policy P.Sensitive_Data
  and the Assumption A. Auth_PKI as it specifies the pre-requisite for the
  Terminal Authentication Protocol v.1 as it concerns the responsibilities of the
  Document Verifier and the Inspection Systems.

4.3 Security Objectives Rationale

4.3.1 Threats

4.3.1.1 Threats listed in PP PACE

T.Skimming addresses accessing the User Data (stored on the TOE or
  transferred between the TOE and the terminal) using the TOE's
  contactless/contact interface. This threat is countered by the security
  objectives        OT.Data_Integrity,        OT.Data_Authenticity        and
  OT.Data_Confidentiality through the PACE authentication. The objective
  OE.Travel_Document_Holder ensures that a PACE session can only be
  established either by the travel document holder itself or by an authorised
  person or device, and, hence, cannot be captured by an attacker.

T.Eavesdropping addresses listening to the communication between the TOE
  and a rightful terminal in order to gain the User Data transferred there. This
  threat is countered by the security objective OT.Data_Confidentiality through a
  trusted channel based on the PACE authentication.

T.Tracing addresses gathering TOE tracing data identifying it remotely by
  establishing or listening to a communication via the contactless/contact
  interface of the TOE, whereby the attacker does not a priori know the correct
  values of the PACE password. This threat is directly countered by security
  objectives    OT.Tracing   (no    gathering   TOE     tracing    data)   and
  OE.Travel_Document_Holder (the attacker does not a priori know the correct
  values of the shared passwords).

T.Forgery 'Forgery of data' addresses the fraudulent, complete or partial
  alteration of the User Data or/and TSF-data stored on the TOE or/and
  exchanged between the TOE and the terminal. Additionally to the security
  objectives from PACE PP [PACE-PP] which counter this threat, the examination
  of     the     presented   MRTD       passport    book       according    to
  OE.Exam_Travel_Document 'Examination of the physical part of the travel
  document' shall ensure its authenticity by means of the physical security
  measures and detect any manipulation of the physical part of the travel
  document.
  The threat T.Forgery also addresses the fraudulent, complete or partial
  alteration of the User Data or/and TSF-data stored on the TOE or/and
                        Security Target Lite
                                                                    Ref.:

                 Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic
                                                                Page: 64/150
                       eMRTD Configuration)

  exchanged between the TOE and the terminal. The security objective
  OT.AC_Pers requires the TOE to limit the write access for the travel document
  to the trustworthy Personalisation Agent (cf. OE.Personalisation). The TOE will
  protect the integrity and authenticity of the stored and exchanged User Data
  or/and TSF-data as aimed by the security objectives OT.Data_Integrity and
  OT.Data_Authenticity, respectively. The objectives OT.Prot_Phys-Tamper and
  OT.Prot_Abuse-Func contribute to protecting integrity of the User Data or/and
  TSF-data stored on the TOE. A terminal operator operating his terminals
  according to OE.Terminal and performing the Passive Authentication using the
  Document Security Object as aimed by OE.Passive_Auth_Sign will be able to
  effectively verify integrity and authenticity of the data received from the TOE.

T.Abuse-Func addresses attacks of misusing TOE's functionality to manipulate
  or to disclosure the stored User- or TSF-data as well as to disable or to bypass
  the soft-coded security functionality. The security objective OT.Prot_Abuse-
  Func ensures that the usage of functions having not to be used in the
  operational phase is effectively prevented.

T.Information_Leakage is typical for integrated circuits like smart cards under
  direct attack with high attack potential. The protection of the TOE against this
  threat is obviously addressed by the directly related security objective
  OT.Prot_Inf_Leak.

T.Phys-Tamper is typical for integrated circuits like smart cards under direct
  attack with high attack potential. The protection of the TOE against this threat
  is obviously addressed by the directly related security objective OT.Prot_Phys-
  Tamper.

T.Malfunction is typical for integrated circuits like smart cards under direct
  attack with high attack potential. The protection of the TOE against this threat
  is obviously addressed by the directly related security objective
  OT.Prot_Malfunction.

4.3.1.2 Additional Threats

T.Read_Sensitive_Data The threat T.Read_Sensitive_Data 'Read the sensitive
  biometric    reference   data'    is  countered     by    the   TOE-objective
  OT.Sens_Data_Conf 'Confidentiality of sensitive biometric reference data'
  requiring that read access to EF.DG3 and EF.DG4 (containing the sensitive
  biometric reference data) is only granted to authorized inspection systems.
  Furthermore it is required that the transmission of these data ensures the
  data's confidentiality. The authorization bases on Document Verifier
  certificates issued by the issuing State or Organisation as required by
  OE.Authoriz_Sens_Data 'Authorization for use of sensitive biometric reference
  data'. The Document Verifier of the receiving State has to authorize Extended
  Inspection Systems by creating appropriate Inspection System certificates for

  access to the sensitive biometric reference data as demanded                by
  OE.Ext_Insp_Systems 'Authorization of Extended Inspection Systems'.

T.Counterfeit 'Counterfeit of travel document chip data' addresses the attack of
  unauthorized copy or reproduction of the genuine travel document's chip. This
  attack is thwarted by chip an identification and authenticity proof required by
  OT.Chip_Auth_Proof 'Proof of travel document's chip authentication' using an
  authentication key pair to be generated by the issuing State or Organisation.
  The Public Chip Authentication Key has to be written into EF.DG14 and signed
  by    means     of  Documents       Security    Objects    as   demanded     by
  OE.Auth_Key_Travel_Document 'Travel document Authentication Key'.
  According to OE.Exam_Travel_Document 'Examination of the physical part of
  the travel document' the General Inspection system has to perform the Chip
  Authentication Protocol Version 1 to verify the authenticity of the travel
  document's chip. Moreover, the Active Authentication Public Key has to be
  written into EF.DG15 as demanded by OE.Auth_Key_MRTD 'MRTD
  Authentication Key'. According to OE.AA_MRTD 'Active Authentication -
  Inspection Systems' the Inspection system has to perform the Active
  Authentication Protocol to verify the authenticity of the MRTD‚Äôs chip.

  covered    by   the    security  objectives    for  the    TOE     environment
  OE.Exam_Travel_Document 'Examination of the physical part of the travel
  document' and OE.AA_MRTD 'Active Authentication - Inspection Systems'
  which requires the inspection system to examine physically the travel
  document, the Basic Inspection System to implement the Basic Access
  Control, the General Inspection Systems and the Extended Inspection Systems
  to implement and to perform the Chip Authentication Protocol Version 1 and
  the Active Authentication Protocol to verify the Authenticity of the presented
  travel document's chip. The security objectives for the TOE environment

  OE.Prot_Logical_Travel_Document 'Protection of data from the logical travel
  document' require the Inspection System to protect the logical travel
  document data during the transmission and the internal handling.

A.Auth_PKI 'PKI for Inspection Systems' is covered by the security objective for
  the TOE environment OE.Authoriz_Sens_Data 'Authorization for use of
  sensitive biometric reference data' requires the CVCA to limit the read access
  to sensitive biometrics by issuing Document Verifier certificates for authorized
  receiving States or Organisations only. The Document Verifier of the receiving
  State is required by OE.Ext_Insp_Systems 'Authorization of Extended
  Inspection Systems' to authorize Extended Inspection Systems by creating
  Inspection System Certificates. Therefore, the receiving issuing State or
  Organisation has to establish the necessary public key infrastructure.

4.3.3.3 Assumptions related to Active Authentication

A.Pers_Agent_AA The assumption A.Pers_Agent_AA is directly covered by
the security objective for the TOE environment OE.Personalization including
the enrolment, the protection with digital signature and the storage of the MRTD
holder personal data.

4.3.3.4 Assumptions related to Polymorphic eMRTD

A.Polymorphic_Auth The assumption A.Polymorphic_Auth is directly covered
  by the following objective:
      o OE.Polymorphic_Auth requiring the secure generation and storage of
         the authentication infrastructure keys and PP/PI/CPI data.

A.Auth_PKI_Polymorphic The assumption A.Auth_PKI_Polymorphic is directly
  covered by the following objective:
     o OE.Authoriz_Polymorphic_Data requiring the authorization for the
        use of Polymorphic eMRTD User Data bases on CVCA/DV/IS certificates
        issued by the issuing State, the Polymorphic eMRTD document issuer or
        Organisation.

A.Insp_Sys_Polymorphic The assumption A.Insp_Sys_Polymorphic is directly
  covered by the following objective:
     o OE.Insp_Sys_Polymorphic requiring the Polymorphic inspection
        systems (Terminals) or authentication services to perform the terminal
        part of PACE with PIN, PA, CAv1, TAv1 and PMA.

User Guidance Documentation Set
Chapter describes briefly the contents of the individual documents of the User Guidance Documentation,
while the individual documents are versioned and entitled in chapter 9 literature and references. The in this
chapter listed set of user guidance documents belongs to the TOE.

This TOE is represented by a number of various products which are all based on the equal design sources. The
TOE hardware remains entirely equal throughout all derivatives, but the usage for example in form of available
memory sizes, availability of the various interfaces, or other functions varies by means of blocking and chip
configuration. The firmware identifier on board depends on the order.
All TOE derivatives are derived from the equal hardware design results.

The TOE can be identified with the Generic Chip Identification Mode (GCIM). The IFX_CCI_000003h with options
hardware platform is identified by defined bytes of the GCIM as detailed in the HRM [1].
The unique hexadecimal values as stated in the title are:
                        ÔÇ∑ IFX_CCI_000003h
                         ÔÇ∑    IFX_CCI_000005h
                         ÔÇ∑    IFX_CCI_000008h
                         ÔÇ∑    IFX_CCI_00000Ch
                         ÔÇ∑    IFX_CCI_000013h
                         ÔÇ∑    IFX_CCI_000014h
                         ÔÇ∑    IFX_CCI_000015h
                         ÔÇ∑    IFX_CCI_00001Ch
                         ÔÇ∑    IFX_CCI_00001Dh
                         ÔÇ∑    IFX_CCI_000021h
                         ÔÇ∑ IFX_CCI_000022h
The user can easily identify from which production line a certain IC is coming. The corresponding identifier is
given in chapter 2.2.6

These bytes clearly identify the hardware platform, or, in other words, the therein possible values for
IFX_CCI_000003h with options (without prefix IFX_CCI_) represent the equal hardware platform of this TOE. This
means that the hardware entirely equals throughout all derivatives and that the differences are achieved by
configuration and blocking means only. These values are unique for this hardware platform. This means that
these values will not be used in any other platform or product.
The interpretation of the output GCIM data is clearly explained in the user guidance, Hardware Reference Manual
HRM [1].
Although the TOE is represented by a number of various products, all based on the equal design sources, the
hardware is constituted out of few slightly different mask sets enabling to adapt to various external contactless
and contact based devices not being part of this TOE. Except this external adapt capability the TOE hardware

and firmware ‚Äì depending on the order option ‚Äì remains entirely equal throughout all derivatives, but the usage
for example in form of available memory sizes, availability of the various interfaces, or other functions varies by
means of blocking and chip configuration. This blocking is applied by Infineon settings during the production
only. Again, all TOE derivatives are derived from the equal hardware design results, the IFX_CCI_000003h with
options.
The differences between the derivatives are achieved by blocking only and have no impact on the TOEs security
policies and related functions. Details are explained in the user guidance hardware reference manual HRM [1].
All product derivatives are identically from module design, layout and footprint, but are made different in their
possibilities to connect to different types of external antennas or to a contact based interface only. Therefore,
the TOE is represented and made out of different mask sets with following TOE internal and security irrelevant
differences:
The differences between the mask sets implement different input capacitances in the analogue part of the radio
frequency interface (RFI). This differentiation in the input capacitances enable for the connection of a wider
range of various antenna types. Note that external antennas or interfaces are not part of the TOE.
To each of the mask sets, an individual value is assigned, which is part of the data output of the Generic Chip
Identification Mode (GCIM). This number is located in the GCIM part individual length byte to clearly
differentiate between the mask sets related to the different input capacitances. Details are explained in the user
guidance hardware reference manual (HRM) and in the errata sheet.
There are no other differences between the mask sets the TOE is produced with.
The IFX_CCI_000003h with options products enable for a maximum of configuration possibilities defined by the
customer order following the market needs. For example, a TOE product can come in one project with the fully
available SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM1 or in another project with any other SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM ‚Äìsize below the
physical implementation size, or with a different RAM size. And more, the user has the free choice, whether he
needs the symmetric co-processor SCP, or the asymmetric co-processor Crypto2304T, or both, or none of them.
In addition, the user decides, whether the TOE comes with a free combination of software libraries or without
any. And, to be even more flexible, various interface options can be chosen as well.

To sum up the major selections, the user defines by his order:
     ÔÇ∑ the firmware identifier in several alternatives
     ÔÇ∑ the available memory sizes of the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM and RAM
     ÔÇ∑ the availability of the cryptographic coprocessors SCP and Crypto@2304T
     ÔÇ∑ the availability and free combinations of the cryptographic libraries
         ACL-1, ACL-2, ACL-3, SCL-1 and SCL-2
     ÔÇ∑ the availability of the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ Cryptographic Library
     ÔÇ∑ the availability of the Flash Loader
     ÔÇ∑ the availability of the alternative libraries HSL-1 or HSL-2 or HSL-3 or HSL-4
     ÔÇ∑ the availability of the library NRG
     ÔÇ∑ the availability of various interface options
     ÔÇ∑ the possibility to tailor the product by blocking on his own premises (BPU)
     ÔÇ∑ the possibility to apply the PIN letter in combination with the Flash Loader
The degree of freedom of the chip configuration is predefined by Infineon Technologies AG and made available
via the order tool.

Beside fix TOE configurations, which can be ordered as usual, this TOE implements optionally the so called
Billing-Per-Use (BPU) ability. This solution enables our customer to tailor the product on his own to the required

configuration ‚Äì project by project. By that BPU allows for significant reduction of logistic cost at all participating
parties and serves for acceleration of delivery of tailored product to the end-user.
BPU enables our customers to block the chip on demand into the final configuration at his own premises, without
further delivery or involving support by Infineon Technology.
The realization of it requires the presence of the Flash Loader software, enhanced with the BPU blocking
software part. The presence of the BPU ability defines the customer with his order.
The user then receives this TOE in a predefined starting configuration, for example entirely unblocked. Again,
the delivered starting configuration depends on the user order. After delivery, the user can put the TOE in
volume on his stock and can block it down to the required sizes and features, whenever a certain configuration is
required by a certain project.
Depending on the number of TOE products delivered, and their individual final blocked configuration, the
customer receives a balancing payment. By that our customers are charged only for the true configurations
required in their projects.
As written above, the software realizing the user allowed blocking, is implemented and delivered in the TOE ‚Äì
depending on the order - and is part of the evaluation and certificate. This software is an additional part of the
Flash Loader software but also the other firmware ‚Äì in all alternative versions - has seen a small enhancement to
enable for BPU.
If BPU is available, the blocking is done by the user at user premises, usually by taking an enhancement of the
user own personalization flow and applying the according APDUs. These APDUs are predefined by Infineon
Technologies and can also depend on the customer order. Only these APDUs can block the chip according to the
user demands.
Infineon Technologies AG provides special software, running in parallel when doing the blocking. This software
summarizes all devices and final configurations allowing for the later commercial balancing. The balancing
depends on the number of chips and their individual final blockings the user has made over a defined time span.
This special software can be used only for the commercial balancing, is not present on the TOE, not security
relevant and therefore not part of this certificate.
All blockings are done by setting the according value in the chip configuration page, where certain parts are left
available to the blocking software. Strong means of authentication are in place. The blocking software
respectively BPU software is an additional part of the Flash Loader software and the only piece of software, able
to manage the blocking APDUs. Therefore, the presence of the Flash Loader software is essential for the BPU
ability.
The user can only apply a predefined and checksum protected set of allowed APDU configuration commands
provided by Infineon Technologies AG. For this, the Flash Loader BPU software part, together with the firmware
‚Äì regardless of the version used -, executes one of those APDUs. After the final blocking is done and the user
additionally may have downloaded his software, the entire Flash Loader including the BPU software part is
permanently deactivated. This is called locking of the Flash Loader.
Of course, exclusively all security relevant settings are contained in the IFX-only part. The Flash Loader BPU
software does not access and has no access to the IFX-only part.
Once the user blocking by applying the APDU has been finalized, the configuration page is no more accessible
for changes. After the locking of the Flash Loader, the product is permanently fixed regarding its configurations
and software. A reactivation of the Flash Loader is not possible. At the next start-up, the Boot-Up-Software
(BOS) applies the made settings, and, if called, a Resource Management System (RMS)-function can output the
finally made chip configuration for verification and information purposes.
The entire configuration storage area is protected against manipulation, perturbation and false access. Note that
the IFX-only part of the configuration page is already access protected prior delivery to the user and the TOE
leaves the Infineon Technology premises only locked into User Mode.
The BPU software part is only active on the products which have been ordered with the BPU option. In all other
cases this software is disabled on the product. If a product is ordered without Flash Loader, also the Flash Loader
software is disabled and the BPU configuration changes are blocked in the IFX-configuration, which renders BPU
functionality unusable. Therefore, the BPU feature is only possible if the Flash Loader is active.

If the user decides to use the Flash Loader, regardless whether it is ordered with or without BPU, an additional
process option can be ordered which results in an additional status of the Flash Loader. This process is called PIN-
Letter and enables for simplified logistics and thereby for faster delivery of the ordered TOE products to the user.
The PIN-Letter feature enabling for the PIN-Letter process is an implemented part of the Flash Loader. The
resulting logistical acceleration is possible since the PIN-Letter enables for delivery of not user-specific
configured, not flashed and not personalized TOE products to the user warehouse.
Extra authentication means applied in the PIN-Letter status of the Flash Loader preserve that only the intended
user with the intended PIN-Letter can configure with user specific information and enable the normal Flash
Loader functions in a second step. By that the user orders the products and receives - in a protected way - the
belonging PIN-Letter. PIN-Letter and delivered chips must match.
By delivery the user warehouse gets filled and depending on market demands the user can immediate apply the
authentication means of the PIN-letter. If passing, the TOE products become user specific configured and the
Flash Loader can be used for this specific user in a second step.
The following table outlines the different ways how the user can input his software on this TOE ‚Äì a TOE without
user available ROM. User software comprises usually the operating system and applications, which are for
Infineon Technologies simply a user data package which is handled as a fixed data package during production.
This provides high process flexibility for the user of which an overview is given in the following table:

For the cases with active Flash Loader on board and whenever the user has finalized his SW-download,
respectively the TOE is in the final state and about to be delivered to the end-user, the user is obligated to lock
the Flash Loader. This locking is the final step and results in a permanent deactivation of the Flash Loader. This
means that once being in the locked status, the Flash Loader cannot be reactivated anymore.
Note that whenever a TOE comes without active Flash Loader, BPU and PIN-Letter process are not possible.
All in all various delivery combinations are given and for example, a product can come with a fix configuration
and with Flash Loader, to enable the user to download software, but without BPU option and with PIN-Letter.
The following cases can occur:

Note that this TOE has no user available ROM. The user software and data are entirely located in a dedicated and
protected part of the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM. The long life storage endurance together with the means for error
detection and correction serves for excellent reliability and endurance.
In addition to the above listed flexible ranges, the user guidance contains a number of predefined configurations
for those customers not making use of the BPU option. All of these configurations belong to the TOE as well and
are of course made of the equal hardware and are inside the above declared ranges.
Today‚Äôs predefined configurations of the TOE are listed in the hardware reference manual HRM [1] and is
completed with the list of identification data of the derivatives. These predefined products come with the most
requested configurations and enables to produce volumes on stock in order to simplify logistic processes.
According to the BPU option, a non-limited number of configurations of the TOE may occur in the field. The
number of various configurations depends on the user and order contract only.
This TOE provides dedicated identification means and outputs the platform identifier, the design step and
further configuration information. The hardware reference manual HRM [1] is part of the user guidance and
enables for the clear interpretation of the read out identification data. More information is given in the
confidential Security Target [8].
These output data enable the user for clear identification of the TOE and also of one of the different mask sets
and therewith for examination of the validity of the certificate.
In addition, a dedicated RMS function allows reading out the present configuration in detail. The output RMS
data together with the hardware reference manual HRM [1] enables for clear identification of a product and its
configuration. All these steps for gathering identification and detailed configuration information can be done by
the user without involving the vendor, Infineon Technologies AG.

The TOE consists of the hardware part, the firmware parts in the alternative versions and the optional software
parts. The Smartcard Embedded Software, i.e. the operating system and applications are not part of the TOE.

The firmware comes with several alternative versions and consists of:
   ÔÇ∑ the Boot Software (BOS) firmware conducting configuration and testing task (see chapter 2.2.2) at start-
        up of the TOE
   ÔÇ∑ the Resource Management System (RMS) library providing essential basis functions for the management
        of the RAM, the branch table, the Memory Management Unit (MMU) and other resources
   ÔÇ∑ the optional Flash Loader enabling for the download of user software to the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM and
        required for the optional Bill per Use (BPU) feature and the PIN-letter feature
   ÔÇ∑ the Radio Frequency Application Interface (RFAPI) supporting functions located in the ROM.
        The RFAPI functions are not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF)
   ÔÇ∑ the NRG ROM part implementing some basic routines and used by the NRG if ordered.
        The NRG ROM part is not part of the TSF functionality.

The firmware parts BOS, RFAPI and NRG are implemented in a separated Test-ROM also being part of the TOE
but not available for the user. Completing firmware components are located in the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM.

The optional software parts are differentiated into following libraries:
   ÔÇ∑ The asymmetric cryptographic libraries (ACL) in following alternative versions:
       v2.08.007, v2.07.003 and v2.06.003.
           o All ACL libraries provide RSA1 2048/4096 cryptography.
                The library supports also smaller key lengths, but the certification follows the national regulation
                by the BSI1.

    ÔÇ∑    the NRG Software. The NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

The RSA, EC and Toolbox libraries provide certain functionality via an API to the Smartcard Embedded Software.
The private parts of the cryptographic libraries are only used internally and have no user interface. If neither the
RSA- nor the EC library is delivered, also the belonging private parts are not on board. The Toolbox library does
not have private library parts.
Each of the libraries ACL, SCL, HSL and NRG is independent from the other libraries and also independent of the
alternative library version of the equal type. This means for example that the HSL-1 runs alone and does not need
parts of HSL-2.
A combination respectively mix up of the two alternative libraries of equal type has not been considered in the
design and is not allowed: The user can select either one or the other of the same library type or none of it.
If the user considers the optional software libraries, the TOE can be delivered including ‚Äì in free combinations ‚Äì
or not including any of the optional libraries.

If the user decides not.
This TOE is intended to be used in any application and device requiring the highest level of security, for example
as secure element in various devices with various form factors.
This member of the high security controller family features a security philosophy focusing on data integrity
instead of numerous sensors. By that two main principles combined in close synergy are utilized in the security
concept called the Integrity Guard. These main principles are the comprehensive error detection, including the
double CPU, and the full encrypted data path, leaving no plain data on the chip. These principles proved that
they provide excellent protection against invasive and non-invasive attacks known today.
The intelligent shielding algorithm finishes the upper layers, finally providing the so called intelligent implicit
active shielding I2-shield. This provides physical protection against probing and forcing.
This TOE provides multiple contact based and contactless interface options for various applications and markets.
Due to the interface flexibility the product can be used in almost any application, within any device and almost
any form factor. Due to these multiple communication possibilities, the TOE can be seen as a stand-alone
security device being capable to maintain the various communication interfaces simultaneously. Therefore this
TOE is able to run multiple applications, using multiple interfaces independently at the same time.
Again these multiple communication and application independency capabilities enable the usage to almost
everywhere, where highly secure applications are in use and of course in any other application as well. This TOE
is deemed for governmental, corporate, transport and payment markets, or wherever a secure root of trust is
required. Various types of applications can use this TOE, for example in closed loop logical access controls,
physical access controls, secure internet access control and internet authentication, or as multi-application token
or simply as encrypted storage.
This dual interface controller is able to communicate using either the contact based or the contactless interface.
The implemented dual interface provides a maximum flexibility in using following communication protocols
respectively methods:

The TOE provides a real 16-bit CPU-architecture and is compatible to the MCS¬Æ251 instruction set with an
execution time faster than a standard MCS¬Æ251 microcontroller at the same clock frequency. The major
components of the core system are the two CPUs (Central Processing Units), acting as one, the MMU (Memory
Management Unit) and the MED (Memory Encryption/Decryption Unit). The Core implements also the Post
Failure Detection (PFD) covering CPU, Cache and MED. The two CPUs control each other in order to detect faults
and serve by this for data integrity. The TOE implements a full 16 MByte linear addressable memory space for
each privilege level, a simple scalable Memory Management concept and a scalable stack size. The flexible
memory concept consists of a ROM, RAM and the non-volatile memory (NVM), which we call SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢
NVM. The ROM is not available for the user.
The ROM is not available for the user and contains the main parts of firmware components only.

The firmware comes in several alternative versions and is composed out of the:
   ÔÇ∑ Boot-up software (BOS), the Resource Management System (RMS), the Flash Loader (FL), the NRG code
        part located in the ROM and the RFI supporting functions. The BOS applies the essential configuration,
        internal testing and the start-up.
        The NRG ROM part and the RFI supporting functions are not part of the TOE Security Functionality
        (TSF).
   ÔÇ∑ The RMS implements a low level application interface (API) to the Smartcard Embedded Software and
        provides handling and managing routines for RAM, MMU, Branch table, configuration and further
        functions.
   ÔÇ∑ The Flash Loader allows downloading user software to the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM during the
        manufacturing process and also at user premises ‚Äì if ordered.
   ÔÇ∑ The Radio Frequency Interface Application Interface (RFAPI) functions consist of executable code in the
        ROM which is part of the TOE and a SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM code part which is delivered separately to the
        user and which is not part of the TOE. The RFAPI is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
   ÔÇ∑ The NRG software part located in the ROM. These routines are only called if the NRG library is executed;
        else these routines are not used. The NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

With regard to the RFAPI part, this means that the TOE products are delivered without the code part located in
the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM. This RFAPI part is a piece of software delivered separated from the chip in order to be
implemented by the user together with his software. Only the RFAPI SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM code part can call the
RFAPI ROM functions and optimize the contactless communication. Therefore, the RFAPI ROM functions do not
implement a user interface. In general the RFAPI implements a fast TOE startup and simplifies the user settings

for optimized contactless communication. The ROM and SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM areas storing the RFAPI functions
are access protected and only the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM part, which is not part of the TOE, implements the user
interface. The RFAPI is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

This TOE implements a Hybrid Random Number Generator (HRNG). This HRNG equals to the expression Hybrid
Physical True Random Number Generator (hybrid PTRNG) as defined by the BSI. In the following, the BSI
expression hybrid PTRNG is used. The hybrid PTRNG implements a true physical random source and has
evidenced its conformance to the classes of AIS31 [13] as declared in chapter 7.1.1.1.
The produced genuine random numbers are available as a security service for the user and are also used for
internal purposes. Together with the guidelines in [6] the hybrid PTRNG operates in the following modes of
operation and is conformant to the named classes:
    ÔÇ∑ True Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.2
    ÔÇ∑ Hybrid Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.3
    ÔÇ∑ Deterministic Random Number Generation (DRNG) AIS31 DRG.3
    ÔÇ∑ Key Stream Generation (KSG), stream cipher generation AIS31 DRG.2
The hybrid PTRNG is deemed for any application requiring excellent physical random data entropy.

The two cryptographic coprocessors serve the need of modern cryptography:
   ÔÇ∑ The symmetric co-processor (SCP) combines both AES and DES with one, two or triple-key hardware
       acceleration. Please note that the single DES algorithm is not in the scope of evaluation due to national
       regulation by BSI.
   ÔÇ∑ And, the Asymmetric Crypto Co-processor, called Crypto@2304T, provides optimized high performance
       calculations for the user software executing cryptographic operations and is also used by the optional
       cryptographic libraries for Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and Elliptic Curve (EC) cryptography.

The optional software parts are differentiated into following libraries:
   ÔÇ∑ The asymmetric cryptographic libraries (ACL) in following alternative versions:
       v2.08.007, v2.07.003 and v2.06.003.

    ÔÇ∑   the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ Cryptographic Library (CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL and CCL) in the version v02.00.0004 provides the
        user OSPT alliance CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ V2 conformant communication functionality between a PICC and a PCD
    ÔÇ∑   the NRG Software. The NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

The RSA cryptographic library, regardless of the version chosen:
    ÔÇ∑ provides a high level interface to the hardware component Crypto2304T and includes countermeasures
        against fault injection and side channel attacks.
    ÔÇ∑ implements the generation of RSA Key Pairs (RsaKeyGen), the RSA signature verification (RsaVerify),
        the RSA signature generation (RsaSign) and the RSA modulus recalculation (RsaModulus). This RSA
        library can perform RSA operations from 512 to 4096 bits.
    ÔÇ∑ implements the high level interface to hardware cryptographic coprocessor Crypto2304T which runs the
        basic long number calculations (add, subtract, multiply, square) with high performance.
The RSA library is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software.
Following the national BSI recommendations, RSA key lengths below 1976 bits are not included in the certificate.
Please note that the BSI expects this key length as appropriate until 2022 and recommends for longer usage
times key lengths of 3000 bits or higher.

The EC library, regardless of the version chosen:
    ÔÇ∑ provides a high level interface to Elliptic Curve Cryptography computed on the hardware component
        Crypto2304T and includes countermeasures against fault injection and side channel attacks.
    ÔÇ∑ implements routines for ECDSA signature generation, for ECDSA signature verification, ECDSA key

        operations like ECC Add and ECC Double.
    ÔÇ∑ EC curves over prime field Fp, as well as over GF(2n) finite field are supported too.
The EC library is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software.
The security functional requirement covers the standard Brainpool [19] and NIST [26] Elliptic Curves with key
lengths of 160, 163, 192, 224, 233, 256, 283, 320, 384, 409, 512 or 521 bits.
The definition of the key lengths follows the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100 bit security level by the
BSI.
Numerous other curve types, being also secure in terms of side channel attacks on this TOE, exist, which the user
optionally can add in the composition certification process.

If the user decides not to use any of the offered cryptographic library(s), regardless of the version, none of the
cryptographic libraries is consequently delivered and the accompanying Additional Specific Security
Functionality (O.Add-Functions) Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and/ or EC is/are not provided by the TOE. Else it
depends of the chosen library whether the Additional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions) Rivest-
Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and/ or EC is/are supported.

The Toolbox library, regardless of the version chosen, does not provide cryptographic support or additional
security functionality as it provides only the following basic long integer arithmetic and modular functions in
software, supported by the cryptographic coprocessor: Addition, subtraction, division, multiplication,
comparison, reduction, modular addition, modular subtraction, modular multiplication, modular inversion and
modular exponentiation. No security relevant policy, mechanism or function is supported. The Toolbox library is
deemed for software developers as support for simplified implementation of long integer and modular
arithmetic operations. The Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

The symmetric cryptographic library SCL offers a high level interface to perform the cryptographic operations
DES, TDES and AES with different key lengths on the symmetric cryptographic coprocessor (SCP) for this TOE.

In addition, the SCL implements MAC computation of a CMAC, using AES and 3DES algorithms, respectively a
RetailMAC using the DES algorithm.
The SCL implements already several block cipher modes as declared in this document and covers a wide range of
applications, but the SCL offers in addition the flexibility to implement additional user defined block cipher
modes.
Both library versions provide a simplified interface to the hardware Symmetric Cryptographic Coprocessor (SCP)
and preserve the security and performance requirements as required by the user.
Even in the basic configuration the SCL meets the tarlse it depends of the chosen library whether the Additional Specific Security Functionality

The Toolbox library, regardless of the version chosen, provides the user optionally basic arithmetic and modular
arithmetic operations, in order to support user software development using long integer operations. These basic
arithmetic operations do not provide security functionality, implement no security mechanism, and do not

Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)


The SCL implements already several bgeted security level, which can be further increased by
simple means of configuration options.
The key lengths used for the AES and DES functionality follow the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100
bit security level issued by the BSI1. This regulation excludes the single DES operation from the certification as it
is considered to be not sufficiently secure from algorithm perspective.
For both versions, the certification covers the SCL cryptographic functionality of the AES algorithm with key
lengths of 128, 192, 256 bits and the TDEA or TripleDES (TDES) algorithm with an effective key size of 112 and
168 bits. For the version v2.04.002 the certification covers the CMAC functionality too.

Note that this TOE can come with both cryptographic co-processors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a
blocked Crypto2304T, or with both cryptographic co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the user‚Äôs
choice. No accessibility of the deselected cryptographic co-processors is without impact on any other security
policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the situation where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic
co-processors.

Beside the inclusion and support of cryptographic libraries this TOE comes with the optional Hardware Support
Library (HSL) in different alternative versions, significantly simplifying the management of the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢
NVM functionality. The HSL constitutes an application interface (API) accessing the HSL state machine and
abstracting low level properties like special function registers and settings of specific hardware features. In short
the HSL provides a user friendly also use case oriented interface considering endurance, reliability and
performance. In certain configurations the HSL provides also functions implementing tearing safe behaviour of
the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM. If used the user has no need to care about cases where the TOE is suddenly cut off the
power supply even during managing the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM.
Anyhow, the HSL remains as an optional library as even sudden power off situations does never lead to
exploitable conditions of the TOE. In the worse the TOE ends operation in case of a faulty programmed SOLID
FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM location due to the Integrity Guard.
In addition to the above, the HSL in version 03.12.8812 and 03.11.8339 provide an advanced additional method
called Incremental Write (IWR). This method provides enhanced endurance of the SOLID FLASH NVM even
beyond the erase endurance limits for often written objects. Thus this method serves applications with a demand
for high endurance and fast writing times. On the other hand, the read times using this method are slower than
the other methods provided.

The order option CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ Cryptographic Library (CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL) provides cryptographic functionality to
implement a CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ V2 conformant protocol.
This protocol provides a secure mutual authentication of two entities, namely the terminal (denoted as PCD =
Proximity Coupling Device (CIPURSE‚Ñ¢-compliant terminal)) and a smart card or a token in other form factors
which is called PICC. PICC stands for Proximity Integrated Circuit Card (CIPURSE‚Ñ¢-compliant card).
Beside the mutual authentication, the protocol implements measures to maintain the integrity of the transferred
data and preserves in parallel the confidentiality of the transferred data.
By that the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL supports the user to implement systems conformant to the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ open standard
implementing a secured, interoperable and flexible transit fare collection solution, including ISO 7816, ISO/IEC
14443-4 communication and AES-128 bit cryptography for multiple payment types.

By that the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL supports the user to implement systems conformant to the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ open standard
implementing a secured, interoperable and flexible transit fare collection solution, including ISO 7816, ISO/IEC
14443-4 communication and AES-128 bit cryptography for multiple payment types.
The order option of the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL is conformant to the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ open standard [18] for both, the PICC and
then PCD software parts. It implements the by the OSPT alliance standardized application interface for the card
and the terminal side.
The scope of this certification of this TOE covers all parts of the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL which are later implemented by
the user on the user card respectively token based on this TOE and the functionality of the PCD software part
which is implemented in the terminal side. The PCD software operates also on the hardware of this TOE which is
implemented in the terminal.
The CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL implements the by the OSPT alliance standardized application interface for the card and the
terminal side.

The NRG Software is a further order option and implements the routines for a NRG interface. The NRG
implements an operating system handling the emulation of an NRG card together with the RF interface. One
part of the NRG is permanently stored in the ROM and the second part consisting of patch and API is located in
the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM. The second part is only present if the NRG is part of the delivery. If the NRG is not part
of the delivery the ROM part is present but not used. The NRG implements tearing safe behaviour in context with
the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM management and is therefore independent from the HSL. The NRG is not part of the
TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

To fulfill the highest security requirements for smartcards today and also in the future, this TOE implements a
progressive digital security concept, which already has been certified in various forerunner processes. This TOE
utilizes digital security features to include customer friendly security, combined with a robust design overcoming
the disadvantages on analogue protection technologies. The TOE provides full on-chip encryption covering the
complete core, busses, memories and cryptographic co-processors leaving no plain                                   shares of the user software during production. These user software

Note that this TOE has no user available ROM. The user software and data are entirely located in a dedicated and
protected part of the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM. The long life storage endurance together with the means for error
detection and correction serves for excellent reliability and endurance.
In addition to the above listed flexible ranges, the user guidance contains a number of predefined configurations
for those customers not making use of the BPU option. All of these configurations belong to the TOE as well and
are of course made of the equal hardware and are inside the above declared ranges.
Today‚Äôs predefined configurations of the TOE are listed in the hardware reference manual HRM [1] and is
completed with the list of identification data of the derivatives. These predefined products come with the most
requested configurations and enables to produce volumes on stock in order to simplify logistic processes.
According to the BPU option, a non-limited number of configurations of the TOE may occur in the field. The
number of various configurations depends on the user and order contract only.
This TOE provides dedicated identification means and outputs the platform identifier, the design step and
further configuration information. The hardware reference manual HRM [1] is part of the user guidance and
enables for the clear interpretation of the read out identification data. More information is given in the
confidential Security Target [8].
These output data enable the user for clear identification of the TOE and also of one of the different mask sets
and therewith for examination of the validity of the certificate.
In addition, a dedicated RMS function allows reading out the present configuration in detail. The output RMS
data together with the hardware reference manual HRM [1] enables for clear identification of a product and its
configuration. All these steps for gathering identification and detailed configuration information can be done by
the user without involving the vendor, Infineon Technologies AG.

The TOE consists of the hardware part, the firmware parts in the alternative versions and the optional software
parts. The Smartcard Embedded Software, i.e. the operating system and applications are not part of the TOE.

The firmware comes with several alternative versions and consists of:
   ÔÇ∑ the Boot Software (BOS) firmware conducting configuration and testing task (see chapter 2.2.2) at start-
        up of the TOE
   ÔÇ∑ the Resource Management System (RMS) library providing essential basis functions for the management
        of the RAM, the branch table, the Memory Management Unit (MMU) and other resources
   ÔÇ∑ the optional Flash Loader enabling for the download of user software to the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM and
        required for the optional Bill per Use (BPU) feature and the PIN-letter feature
   ÔÇ∑ the Radio Frequency Application Interface (RFAPI) supporting functions located in the ROM.
        The RFAPI functions are not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF)
   ÔÇ∑ the NRG ROM part implementing some basic routines and used by the NRG if ordered.
        The NRG ROM part is not part of the TSF functionality.

The firmware parts BOS, RFAPI and NRG are implemented in a separated Test-ROM also being part of the TOE
but not available for the user. Completing firmware components are located in the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM.

The optional software parts are differentiated into following libraries:
   ÔÇ∑ The asymmetric cryptographic libraries (ACL) in following alternative versions:
       v2.08.007, v2.07.003 and v2.06.003.
           o All ACL libraries provide RSA1 2048/4096 cryptography.
                The library supports also smaller key lengths, but the certification follows the national regulation

The RSA, EC and Toolbox libraries provide certain functionality via an API to the Smartcard Embedded Software.
The private parts of the cryptographic libraries are only used internally and have no user interface. If neither the

not have private library parts.
Each of the libraries ACL, SCL, HSL and NRG is independent from the other libraries and also independent of the

A combination respectively mix up of the two alternative libraries of equal type has not been considered in the
design and is not allowed: The user can select either one or the other of the same library type or none of it.
If the user considers the optional software libraries, the TOE can be delivered including ‚Äì in free combinations ‚Äì
or not including any of the optional libraries.

If the user decides not.
This TOE is intended to be used in any application and device requiring the highest level of security, for example
as secure element in various devices with various form factors.
This member of the high security controller family features a security philosophy focusing on data integrity
instead of numerous sensors. By that two main principles combined in close synergy are utilized in the security
concept called the Integrity Guard. These main principles are the comprehensive error detection, including the
double CPU, and the full encrypted data path, leaving no plain data on the chip. These principles proved that
they provide excellent protection against invasive and non-invasive attacks known today.
The intelligent shielding algorithm finishes the upper layers, finally providing the so called intelligent implicit
active shielding I2-shield. This provides physical protection against probing and forcing.
This TOE provides multiple contact based and contactless interface options for various applications and markets.
Due to the interface flexibility the product can be used in almost any application, within any device and almost
any form factor. Due to these multiple communication possibilities, the TOE can be seen as a stand-alone
security device being capable to maintain the various communication interfaces simultaneously. Therefore this
TOE is able to run multiple applications, using multiple interfaces independently at the same time.
Again these multiple communication and application independency capabilities enable the usage to almost
everywhere, where highly secure applications are in use and of course in any other application as well. This TOE
is deemed for governmental, corporate, transport and payment markets, or wherever a secure root of trust is
required. Various types of applications can use this TOE, for example in closed loop logical access controls,
physical access controls, secure internet access control and internet authentication, or as multi-application token
or simply as encrypted storage.
This dual interface controller is able to communicate using either the contact based or the contactless interface.
The implemented dual interface provides a maximum flexibility in using following communication protocols
respectively methods:

The TOE provides a real 16-bit CPU-architecture and is compatible to the MCS¬Æ251 instruction set with an
execution time faster than a standard MCS¬Æ251 microcontroller at the same clock frequency. The major
components of the core system are the two CPUs (Central Processing Units), acting as one, the MMU (Memory
Management Unit) and the MED (Memory Encryption/Decryption Unit). The Core implements also the Post
Failure Detection (PFD) covering CPU, Cache and MED. The two CPUs control each other in order to detect faults
and serve by this for data integrity. The TOE implements a full 16 MByte linear addressable memory space for
each privilege level, a simple scalable Memory Management concept and a scalable stack size. The flexible
memory concept consists of a ROM, RAM and the non-volatile memory (NVM), which we call SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢
NVM. The ROM is not available for the user.
The ROM is not available for the user and contains the main parts of firmware components only.

The firmware comes in several alternative versions and is composed out of the:
   ÔÇ∑ Boot-up software (BOS), the Resource Management System (RMS), the Flash Loader (FL), the NRG code
        part located in the ROM and the RFI supporting functions. The BOS applies the essential configuration,
        internal testing and the start-up.
        The NRG ROM part and the RFI supporting functions are not part of the TOE Security Functionality
        (TSF).
   ÔÇ∑ The RMS implements a low level application interface (API) to the Smartcard Embedded Software and
        provides handling and managing routines for RAM, MMU, Branch table, configuration and further
        functions.
   ÔÇ∑ The Flash Loader allows downloading user software to the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM during the
        manufacturing process and also at user premises ‚Äì if ordered.
   ÔÇ∑ The Radio Frequency Interface Application Interface (RFAPI) functions consist of executable code in the
        ROM which is part of the TOE and a SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM code part which is delivered separately to the
        user and which is not part of the TOE. The RFAPI is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
   ÔÇ∑ The NRG software part located in the ROM. These routines are only called if the NRG library is executed;
        else these routines are not used. The NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

With regard to the RFAPI part, this means that the TOE products are delivered without the code part located in
the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM. This RFAPI part is a piece of software delivered separated from the chip in order to be
implemented by the user together with his software. Only the RFAPI SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM code part can call the
RFAPI ROM functions and optimize the contactless communication. Therefore, the RFAPI ROM functions do not
implement a user interface. In general the RFAPI implements a fast TOE startup and simplifies the user settings

are access protected and only the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM part, which is not part of the TOE, implements the user
interface. The RFAPI is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

This TOE implements a Hybrid Random Number Generator (HRNG). This HRNG equals to the expression Hybrid
Physical True Random Number Generator (hybrid PTRNG) as defined by the BSI. In the following, the BSI
expression hybrid PTRNG is used. The hybrid PTRNG implements a true physical random source and has
evidenced its conformance to the classes of AIS31 [13] as declared in chapter 7.1.1.1.
The produced genuine random numbers are available as a security service for the user and are also used for
internal purposes. Together with the guidelines in [6] the hybrid PTRNG operates in the following modes of
operation and is conformant to the named classes:
    ÔÇ∑ True Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.2
    ÔÇ∑ Hybrid Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.3
    ÔÇ∑ Deterministic Random Number Generation (DRNG) AIS31 DRG.3
    ÔÇ∑ Key Stream Generation (KSG), stream cipher generation AIS31 DRG.2
The hybrid PTRNG is deemed for any application requiring excellent physical random data entropy.

The two cryptographic coprocessors serve the need of modern cryptography:
   ÔÇ∑ The symmetric co-processor (SCP) combines both AES and DES with one, two or triple-key hardware
       acceleration. Please note that the single DES algorithm is not in the scope of evaluation due to national
       regulation by BSI.
   ÔÇ∑ And, the Asymmetric Crypto Co-processor, called Crypto@2304T, provides optimized high performance
       calculations for the user software executing cryptographic operations and is also used by the optional
       cryptographic libraries for Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and Elliptic Curve (EC) cryptography.

The optional software parts are differentiated into following libraries:
   ÔÇ∑ The asymmetric cryptographic libraries (ACL) in following alternative versions:

    ÔÇ∑ implements the high level interface to hardware cryptographic coprocessor Crypto2304T which runs the
        basic long number calculations (add, subtract, multiply, square) with high performance.
The RSA library is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software.
Following the national BSI recommendations, RSA key lengths below 1976 bits are not included in the certificate.
Please note that the BSI expects this key length as appropriate until 2022 and recommends for longer usage

    ÔÇ∑ EC curves over prime field Fp, as well as over GF(2n) finite field are supported too.
The EC library is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software.

lengths of 160, 163, 192, 224, 233, 256, 283, 320, 384, 409, 512 or 521 bits.
The definition of the key lengths follows the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100 bit security level by the
BSI.
Numerous other curve types, being also secure in terms of side channel attacks on this TOE, exist, which the user
optionally can add in the composition certification process.

If the user decides not to use any of the offered cryptographic library(s), regardless of the version, none of the
cryptographic libraries is consequently delivered and the accompanying Additional Specific Security

depends of the chosen library whether the Additional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions) Rivest-

The Toolbox library, regardless of the version chosen, does not provide cryptographic support or additional
security functionality as it provides only the following basic long integer arithmetic and modular functions in
software, supported by the cryptographic coprocessor: Addition, subtraction, division, multiplication,
comparison, reduction, modular addition, modular subtraction, modular multiplication, modular inversion and

Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)


The SCL implements already several bgeted security level, which can be further increased by
simple means of configuration options.
The key lengths used for the AES and DES functionality follow the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100
bit security level issued by the BSI1. This regulation excludes the single DES operation from the certification as it
is considered to be not sufficiently secure from algorithm perspective.
For both versions, the certification covers the SCL cryptographic functionality of the AES algorithm with key
lengths of 128, 192, 256 bits and the TDEA or TripleDES (TDES) algorithm with an effective key size of 112 and
168 bits. For the version v2.04.002 the certification covers the CMAC functionality too.

Note that this TOE can come with both cryptographic co-processors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a
blocked Crypto2304T, or with both cryptographic co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the user‚Äôs
choice. No accessibility of the deselected cryptographic co-processors is without impact on any other security
policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the situation where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic
co-processors.

Beside the inclusion and support of cryptographic libraries this TOE comes with the optional Hardware Support
Library (HSL) in different alternative versions, significantly simplifying the management of the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢
NVM functionality. The HSL constitutes an application interface (API) accessing the HSL state machine and
abstracting low level properties like special function registers and settings of specific hardware features. In short
the HSL provides a user friendly also use case oriented interface considering endurance, reliability and
performance. In certain configurations the HSL provides also functions implementing tearing safe behaviour of
the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM. If used the user has no need to care about cases where the TOE is suddenly cut off the
power supply even during managing the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM.
Anyhow, the HSL remains as an optional library as even sudden power off situations does never lead to
exploitable conditions of the TOE. In the worse the TOE ends operation in case of a faulty programmed SOLID
FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM location due to the Integrity Guard.
In addition to the above, the HSL in version 03.12.8812 and 03.11.8339 provide an advanced additional method
called Incremental Write (IWR). This method provides enhanced endurance of the SOLID FLASH NVM even
beyond the erase endurance limits for often written objects. Thus this method serves applications with a demand
for high endurance and fast writing times. On the other hand, the read times using this method are slower than
the other methods provided.

The order option CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ Cryptographic Library (CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL) provides cryptographic functionality to
implement a CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ V2 conformant protocol.
This protocol provides a secure mutual authentication of two entities, namely the terminal (denoted as PCD =
Proximity Coupling Device (CIPURSE‚Ñ¢-compliant terminal)) and a smart card or a token in other form factors
which is called PICC. PICC stands for Proximity Integrated Circuit Card (CIPURSE‚Ñ¢-compliant card).
Beside the mutual authentication, the protocol implements measures to maintain the integrity of the transferred
data and preserves in parallel the confidentiality of the transferred data.
By that the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL supports the user to implement systems conformant to the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ open standard
implementing a secured, interoperable and flexible transit fare collection solution, including ISO 7816, ISO/IEC
14443-4 communication and AES-128 bit cryptography for multiple payment types.

Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)


By that the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL supports the user to implement systems conformant to the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ open standard
implementing a secured, interoperable and flexible transit fare collection solution, including ISO 7816, ISO/IEC
14443-4 communication and AES-128 bit cryptography for multiple payment types.
The order option of the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL is conformant to the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ open standard [18] for both, the PICC and
then PCD software parts. It implements the by the OSPT alliance standardized application interface for the card
and the terminal side.
The scope of this certification of this TOE covers all parts of the CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL which are later implemented by
the user on the user card respectively token based on this TOE and the functionality of the PCD software part
which is implemented in the terminal side. The PCD software operates also on the hardware of this TOE which is
implemented in the terminal.
The CIPURSE‚Ñ¢ CL implements the by the OSPT alliance standardized application interface for the card and the
terminal side.

The NRG Software is a further order option and implements the routines for a NRG interface. The NRG
implements an operating system handling the emulation of an NRG card together with the RF interface. One
part of the NRG is permanently stored in the ROM and the second part consisting of patch and API is located in
the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM. The second part is only present if the NRG is part of the delivery. If the NRG is not part
of the delivery the ROM part is present but not used. The NRG implements tearing safe behaviour in context with
the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM management and is therefore independent from the HSL. The NRG is not part of the
TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

To fulfill the highest security requirements for smartcards today and also in the future, this TOE implements a
progressive digital security concept, which already has been certified in various forerunner processes. This TOE
utilizes digital security features to include customer friendly security, combined with a robust design overcoming
the disadvantages on analogue protection technologies. The TOE provides full on-chip encryption covering the
complete core, busses, memories and cryptographic co-processors leaving no plain data on the chip. A further
security feature has been implemented for this TOE protecting also the involved addresses transferred over the
memory bus. Therefore the attractiveness for attackers is a step further extremely reduced as encrypted signals
are of no use for the attacker ‚Äì neither for manipulation nor for eavesdropping.
In addition, the TOE is equipped with a comprehensive error detection capability for the complete data path. The
dual CPU approach allows error detection even while processing. A comparator detects whether a calculation
was performed without errors. This approach does not leave any parts of the core circuitry unprotected. The
concept allows that the relevant attack scenarios are detected, whereas other conditions that would not lead to
an error would mainly be ignored. That renders the TOE robust against environmental influences.
Furthermore, the TOE implements what we call intelligent implicit shielding (I2). These measures constitute a
shield on sensitive and security critical signals which is not recognizable or obvious as a shield. This provides
excellent protection against invasive physical attacks, such as probing, forcing or similar.
In this Security Target the TOE is briefly described and a summary specification is given. The security
environment of the TOE durlock cipher modes as declared in this document and covering a wide range
of applications, the SCL offers in addition the flexibility to implement additional block cipher modes defined by
the user.
This library provides a simplified interface to the hardware Symmetric Cryptographic Coprocessor (SCP) and
preserves the security and performance requirements as required by the user.
Note that the definition of the key lengths follows the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100 bit security
level by the BSI. This excludes the single DES operation from the certification.

Beside the inclusion and support of cryptographic libraries this TOE comes with the optional Hardware Support
Library (HSL) in different versions significantly simplifying the management of the SOLID FLASH‚Ñ¢ NVM
functionality. The HSL constitutes an application interface (API) accessing the HSL state machine and
abstracting low level properties like special function registers and settings of specific hardware features. In short
the HSL provides a user friendly also useing its different phases of the lifecycle is defined. The assets are identified which
have to be protected through the security policy. The threats against these assets are described. The security
objectives and the security policy are defined, as well as the security requirements. These security requirements
are built out of the security functional requirements as part of the security policy and the security assurance
requirements. These are the formal steps applied during the evaluation and certification showing that the TOE
meets the targeted requirements. In additi case oriented interface considering endurance, reliability and
performance requirements.
In certain configurations each of the HSL versions provide also functions implementing tearing safe behavon, simplified functionality of the TOE matching the requirements is
described.
