A customer can identify the TOE hardware and its configuration (for details see chapter 1.4.7) using the Non-ISO
ATR. The Non-ISO ATR outputs a Common Criteria Certification Identifier and firmware identifier, which links
the TOE to this ST. Specific firmware functions can be used to determine the exact configuration of a device
from the certified range defined in Table 3.
The TOE can be ordered with a preloaded image. This image contains NVM loader functionality and is called
PFL (Performance Flash Loader) with version v09.10.90.9. The PFL is intended to be used in a secured
environment only and is not part of the TOE.

The TOE hardware consists of a core, a memory system and peripherals.
The major components of the core system are a 32-bit CPU (Central Processing Unit), an MPU (Memory
Protection Unit), a Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC) and an Instruction Stream Signature Checking
(ISS).
The MPU of the core stores code and data in a linear 4-GByte memory space (32-bit range), allowing direct
access without the need to swap memory segments in and out of memory using a memory protection unit.
There are two separate bus entities: a memory bus and a peripheral bus for high-speed communication with
the peripherals.
The SPAU can be configured by the user to block or allow peripheral access. It can also be used to block RAM
areas (For keeping Figure 1 simple, the connection between SPAU and RAM is not shown). The CPAU enables
the user to block or allow unprivileged level access to NVM and specific registers of ICS and NVM.

Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)

The CPU accesses memory via the Internal Ciphering System (ICS), which encrypts/decrypts memory content.
All data of the memory block is encrypted. The NVM is equipped with an error correction code (ECC). Security
modules manage the alarms. Alarms may be triggered when the environmental conditions are outside the
specified operational range.
A set of sensors (temperature sensor, backside light detector, glitch sensor, low frequency sensor) is used to
detect excessive deviations from the specified operational range and serve for robustness of the TOE. The
UMSLC function can be used to test the alarm lines.
A Random Number Generator (RNG) consist of a physical Random Number Generator with a cryptographically
strong post processing unit. It can be operated in the modes as follows:
 True Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.2
 Hybrid Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.3
 Deterministic Random Number Generation (DRNG) AIS31 DRG.3 and DRG.4

The Symmetric Cryptographic Processor (SCP) implements calculation of dual-key or triple-key triple-DES and
AES.
The µSM4 supports the Chinese standard encryption algorithm SM4.
The Crypto2304T co-processor provides basic means optimized for the implementation of fast and secure
software of many asymmetric or public key cryptographic schemes like RSA or elliptic curve based ones. The
user accessibility of the Crypto2304T is a customer ordering option
The implemented sleep mode logic (clock stop mode per ISO/IEC 7816-3) is used to reduce overall power
consumption.
The TOE is able to communicate using either its contact based or contactless interface (RF interface). The
contact based interface allows to use the ISO 7816 protocol via the UART. Further it offers a GPIO and an I2C
slave interface. The contactless interface can be configured to RFI or ACLB mode. Both interface types support
the signaling modes as follows:
 Signalling mode ISO/IEC 14443, Type A and Type B
 Signalling mode ISO/IEC 18092 passive mode, Type F
 NRGҹ interface

The UMSLC enables the user software to check the activity and proper function of the system’s security
features.
The Clock Unit (CLKU) supplies the clocks for all components of the TOE. The Clock Unit can work in internal
and external clock mode. When operating the internal clock mode the system frequency is derived from an
oscillator, whereas in external clock mode, the system clock is derived from an externally supplied interface
clock.
The watchdog timer triggers an event in case of a counter overflow. The timers are general purpose up-
counting timers.
A CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) module computes a checksum value from a message or any other block of
data.
The ROM is used by IFX only. The user software has to be implemented in SOLID FLASHҹ memory. The user can
choose, whether the software is loaded into the SOLID FLASHҹ memory by Infineon Technologies AG or by the
user.
The TOE uses Special Function Registers (SFRs). These SFRs are used for general purposes and chip
configuration; they are located in SOLID FLASHҹ memory in a configuration area page. The Online

Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)

Configuration Check (OCC) function is used for register protection, i.e. controls the modification of relevant
SFR settings.
In case a security violation is detected, secure state is entered by the hardware.

1.4.1.2            Firmware and software components
The TOE provides low-level firmware components: the Boot Software (BOS), the Performance Optimized Write
Scheme (POWS) and the Flash Loader (FL).
The BOS firmware is used for test purposes during start-up and the FL allows downloading of user software to
the NVM during the manufacturing process. All mandatory functions for start-up and internal testing are
protected by a dedicated hardware firewall with two levels “BOS” and “user”.
The POWS library is an internal firmware library, i.e. not accessible by the user. It is used by the BOS and FL to
store data in NVM in a tearing safe manner.
The Flash Loader allows downloading of User Software into the NVM during the manufacturing process.
The software of the TOE consists of optional packages:
   NRGҹ SW: The optional NRGҹ SW supports Card and Reader Mode, e.g. card creation, personalization and
    deletion. The NRGҹ SW does not implement any security functionality
   HSL: The optional HSL provides functionality via APIs to the Smartcard Embedded Software . which
    contains SOLID FLASHҹ NVM service routines and functionality for tearing safe programming of SOLID
    FLASHҹ NVM.
   UMSLC lib: this library provides a wrapper around the UMSLC hardware functionality with measures to
    counter fault attacks.
   Symmetric Crypto Library (SCL): The optional SCL is used to provide a high level interface to the TDES and
    AES cryptography, which is partly implemented on the hardware component SCP and includes
    countermeasures against SPA, DPA and DFA attacks. The SCL is delivered as object code and in this way
    integrated into the user software.
   Asymmetric Crypto Library (ACL): The optional ACL implements RSA and elliptic curve based cryptographic
    schemes

1.4.1.3            User Guidance components
The user guidance consists of the components as follows:
   32-bit Security Controller – V11, Hardware Reference Manual: description of hardware features and user
    interfaces

1.4.2              Physical scope of the TOE
The physical scope of the TOE is defined by the TOE components described in chapter 1.4.1

1.4.3              Logical scope of the TOE
The logical scope of the TOE consists of the logical security features provided by the TOE. These features are
listed in chapter 1.3.2. More details are provided in this chapter:
   Cryptographic support: TDES, AES (block cipher modes ECB, CBC, CFB, CTR and CMAC), RNG (Hybrid
    Random Number Generator PTG.3, True Random Number Generator PTG.2, Deterministic Random Number
    generator DRG.3 and DRG.4 according to [BSI_RNGs]), RSA, ECC, ECDSA, ECDH.
   Memory protection unit supporting up to eight memory regions with different access rights and two
    privilege levels “privileged” and “user”. “User” level is more restricted in using TOE resources compared to
    “privileged”
   Memory encryption: all data of memories ROM, RAM and NVM are encrypted. Addresses are scrambled to
    disguise the location of data
   Robust set of sensors and detectors for the purpose of monitoring proper chip operating conditions
    consisting of a temperature sensor, backside light detector, glitch sensor and low frequency sensor.
   Redundant alarm propagation and system deactivation principle, which decreases the risk of manipulation
    and tampering.
   Register protection: protection of security relevant registers against fault attacks using OCC.
   Security life control: a life test on specific security features can be used by the IC embedded software to
    detect manipulation of these security features
   Program flow integrity protection: The Instruction Stream Signature Checking (ISS) can be employed by the
    IC embedded software to detect illegal program flows and trigger an alarm. The TOE also contains a
    watchdog, which may be used to detect program flow manipulations.
   Peripheral access control: The TOE allows the IC embedded software to lock certain peripherals
    dynamically.
   Bus encryption for security peripherals: All data transfers to and from dedicated peripherals are encrypted
    dynamically.
   Tearing safe NVM programming: the HSL provides specific routines provided for tearing safe programming.
    These routines prevent an unspecified interim state by either propagating the pre- or post-programming
    condition.
   Security optimized wiring: shield lines in combination with layout measures reduce the risk of successful
    manipulative attacks.
   Leakage control of data dependant code execution: dedicated measures allow the user to reduce such
    leakage.
   Device phase management supporting isolation of test features and Flash Loader accessibility: dedicated
    test features employed during production are switched off before customer delivery. The Flash Loader
    usage to download flash data requires either a mutual authentication or a one way user authentication
    depending on the order option EA. The Flash Loader supports permanent deactivation.

  Detection of NVM single and multi bit errors: Single bit errors are detected and corrected and multi bit errors
   detected.
Features, which are not mentioned here do not directly contribute to the SFRs.

1.4.4              Interfaces of the TOE
   The physical interface of the TOE to the external environment is the entire surface of the IC.
   The electrical interface of the TOE to the external environment is constituted by the pads of the chip:
             o The five ISO 7816 pads consist particularly of the contacted RES, I/O, CLK lines and supply lines
                 VCC and GND. The contact based communication is according to ISO 7816/ETSI/EMV.
             o The I2C communication can be driven via the ISO 7816 pads. In this case no other
                 communication using the ISO 7816 pads is possible.
   The RF interface (radio frequency power and signal interface) enables contactless communication between
    a PICC (proximity integration chip card) and a PCD reader/writer (proximity coupling device). Power supply
    is received and data are received or transmitted by an antenna which consists of a coil with a few turns
    directly connected to the IC.
   The data-oriented I/O interface of the TOE is represented by the I/O pad.
   The interface between firmware and hardware consists of special registers used for hardware configuration
    and control (Special Function Registers, SFR).
   Optional: The interface of the TOE to the operating system is covered by the optional HSL routines and by
    the instruction set of the TOE.
   Optional: The interface of the NRGҹ SW defined by the NRGҹ SW
   The interface of the UMSLC lib defined by the UMSLC lib
   Optional: The interface to the SCL calculations is defined by the SCL
   Optional: The interface to the ACL calculations is defined by the ACL

1.4.5              Forms of Delivery
The TOE can be delivered in the form of complete modules, as plain wafers in an IC case (e.g. DSO20) or in bare
dies. The delivery can therefore be at the end of phase 3 or at the end of phase 4 which may also include pre-
personalization steps according to [PP0084]. This means phase 4 is also part of the evaluation process. In any
case the testing of the TOE is finished and the extended test features are removed. From a security policy point
of view the different forms of delivery do not have any impact.
The delivery to the software developer (phase 2  phase 1) contains the documents as described above.
Part of the software delivery is the Flash Loader program, provided by Infineon Technologies AG, running on
the TOE and controlling the download of user software onto the TOE via the UART or RF interface. The
download is only possible after successful authentication. The user software and data must be encrypted
before download. In addition, the user can permanently block further use of the Flash Loader.
The table as follows provides an overview about form and method of TOE deliveries:

2                        Conformance Claims (ASE_CCL)
2.1                      Conformance Claims (ASE CCL)
This ST and TOE claim conformance to CC v3.1 revision 5. The ST claims conformance to [CCBook3]. It is
[CCBook2] extended.

2.1.1                    PP Claim
This ST is strictly conformant to [PP0084]. The assurance level is EAL6+. The augmentation is achieved - with
regard to [CCBook3]: Security assurance components by including:

Table 5          Augmentations of the assurance level of the TOE
    Assurance Class                              Assurance Family                             Description
    Life-cycle support                           ALC_FLR.1                                    Basic flaw remediation

The Security IC Platform Protection Profile with Augmentation Packages is registered and certified by the
Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik1 (BSI) under the reference [PP0084].
The security assurance requirements of the TOE are according to [PP0084 and [CCBook3].

2.1.2                    Package Claim
This ST claims conformance to the following additional packages taken from [PP0084]:
 Package Authentication of the Security IC, section 7.2, conformant.
      This package is only claimed in case TOE is ordered with configuration option EA unavailable.
     Package Loader, Package 1: Loader dedicated for usage in secured environment only, section 7.3.1,
      conformant
      This package is optional and fulfilled only by TOE products with Flash Loader.
     Package Loader, Package 2: Loader dedicated for usage by authorized users only,
      section 7.3.2, augmented
      This package is optional and fulfilled only by TOE products with Flash Loader and configuration option EA

Conformance Claims (ASE_CCL)

 the IC Dedicated Test Software,
 the IC Dedicated Support Software.

The TOE is designed, produced and/or generated by the TOE Manufacturer.
The security problem definition of [PP0084] is enhanced by adding additional threats and an environmental
objective. Including these add-ons, the security problem definition of this ST is consistent with the statement of
the security problem definition in [PP0084], as the ST claims strict conformance to [PP0084].
The threat memory access violation T.Mem-Access has been added, due to specific TOE memory access control
functionality. This add-on has no impact on the conformance statements regarding [CCbook1] and [PP0084]
with following rational:
   The security target remains conformant to [CCbook1], claim 576 as the possibility to introduce additional
    restrictions is given.
 The security target fulfils the strict conformance claim of [PP0084] due to the application notes 5, 6 and 7
    which apply here. By those notes the addition of further security functions and security services are
    covered, even without deriving particular security functionality from a threat but from a policy.
The threat T.Open_Samples_Diffusion is added in case physical protection during TOE delivery to customers is
omitted. This threat increases the scope of threats and does not contradict to any of the defined threats of
[PP0084].
The environmental objective OE.Prevent_Masquerade is added to require the environment to add additional
measures in case EA is available in order to prevent masquerading attacks. The strict conformance to [PP0084]
is still met, because the ability of the TOE to prevent masquerading attacks is met by an optional package , i.e.
“Package Authentication of the Security IC”. In case this package is not claimed, the TOE does not provide
sufficient measures to prevent masquerading. Requesting the environment to fill this gap is an important
requirement, if masquerading attacks are considered relevant. [PP0084] does not add any considerations in
case the TOE does not claim this package.

Security Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)


3                  Security Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)
The content of [PP0084] applies to this chapter completely.

3.1                Threats
The threats are directed against the assets and/or the security functions of the TOE. For example, certain
attacks are only one step towards a disclosure of assets while others may directly lead to a compromise of the
application security. The more detailed description of specific attacks is given later on in the process of
evaluation and certification. An overview on attacks is given in [PP0084] section 3.2.
The threats to security are defined and described in [PP0084] sections 3.2 and 7.2.1.

Table 6       Threats according to [PP0084]
 T.Phys-Manipulation         Physical Manipulation
 T.Phys-Probing              Physical Probing
 T.Malfunction               Malfunction due to Environmental Stress
 T.Leak-Inherent             Inherent Information Leakage
 T.Leak-Forced               Forced Information Leakage
 T.Abuse-Func                Abuse of Functionality
 T.RND                       Deficiency of Random Numbers
 T.Masquerade_TOE            Masquerade the TOE

3.1.1              Additional Threat due to TOE specific Functionality
The additional functionality of introducing sophisticated privilege levels and access control allows the secure
separation between the operation system(s) and applications, the secure downloading of applications after
personalization and enables multitasking by separating memory areas and performing access controls
between different applications. Due to this additional functionality “area based memory access control” a new
threat is introduced.
The TOE shall avert the threat “Memory Access Violation (T.Mem-Access)” as specified below:
T.Mem-Access           Memory Access Violation
                       Parts of the Smartcard Embedded Software may cause security violations by
                       accidentally or deliberately accessing restricted data (which may include code) or
                       privilege levels. Any restrictions are defined by the security policy of the specific
                       application context and must be implemented by the Smartcard Embedded Software.
“Diffusion of open samples” threat:
T.Open_Samples_Diffusion Diffusion of Open Samples
                       An attacker may get access to open samples of the TOE and use them to gain
                       information about the TSF (loader, memory management unit, ROM code …). He may
                       also use the open samples to characterize the behavior of the IC and its security
                       functionalities (for example: characterization of side channel profiles, perturbation
                       cartography …). The execution of a dedicated security features (for example: execution
                       of a DES computation without countermeasures or by de-activating countermeasures)

4.3                Security Objectives Rationale
The security objectives rationale of the TOE is defined and described in [PP0084] section 4.4, 7.3.1, 7.3.2, 7.4.1
and section 7.4.2.
Compared to [PP0084] an enhancement regarding memory area protection has been established. The clear
definition of privilege levels for operated software establishes the clear separation of different restricted
memory areas for running the firmware, downloading and/or running the operating system and to establish a
clear separation between different applications. Nevertheless, it is also possible to define a shared memory
section where separated applications may exchange defined data. The privilege levels clearly define by using a
hierarchical model the access right from one level to the other. These measures ensure that the threat T.Mem-
Access is clearly covered by the security objective O.Mem-Access.
The objectives O.Authentication, O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader and the organizational policiy P.Ctrl_Loader and the
environmental objective OE.TOE_Auth as described in [PP0084] chapter 7.2 and 7.3.2 apply only to TOE
products with Flash Loader enabled for software or data download by the user. In other cases the Flash Loader
is not available anymore and the user software or data download is completed. If TOE is ordered with
configuration option EA available the objectives O.Authentication and the environmental objective
OE.TOE_Auth are not applicable for the TOE. In this case, the TOE implements a one-way authentication of
users instead of a mutual authentication.
The objective OE.Prevent_Masquerade requires measures by customers to ensure the authenticity of the TOE.
Due to the combination of these measures with the one-way authentication enforced by the Flash Loader with
EA, both communication end points are considered to be authentic. Therefore, O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader is still
applicable while the objective OE.Loader_Usage is replaced by the objective OE.Prevent_Masquerade.
The objectives O.RSA, O.ECC, O.AES-TDES-MAC cover the policy P.Crypto_Services. This policy intends to allow
adding various cryptographic services to the TSF.

The objective O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality counters the threat T.Open_Samples_Diffusion. In addition
T.Open_Samples_Diffusion is countered by O.Leak-Inherent and O.Leak-Forced.
The environmental objective OE. Prevent_Masquerade is introduced because the availability of package
“Authentication of the Security IC” depends on specific order options. In case the chosen order options exclude
this package, the user has to provide measures to neutralize the threat T.Masquerade_TOE.

Extended Component Definition (ASE_ECD)


5                  Extended Component Definition (ASE_ECD)
There are several extended components defined and described for the TOE:
   the family FCS_RNG at the class FCS Cryptographic Support
   the family FMT_LIM at the class FMT Security Management
   the family FAU_SAS at the class FAU Security Audit
   the family FDP_SDC at the class FDP User Data Protection
   the family FIA_API at the class FIA Identification and Authentication
   the component FPT_TST.2 at the class FPT Protection of the TSF
The extended families FCS_RNG, FMT_LIM, FAU_SAS, FDP_SDC and FIA_API are defined and described in
[PP0084] section 5. The component FPT_TST.2 is defined in the following sections.

5.1                Component “Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)”
The security is strongly dependent on the correct operation of the security functions. Therefore, the TOE shall
support that particular security functions or mechanisms are tested in the operational phase (Phase 7). The
tests can be initiated by the Smartcard Embedded Software and/or by the TOE or is done automatically and
continuously.
Part 2 of the Common Criteria provides the security functional component “TSF testing (FPT_TST.1)”. The
component FPT_TST.1 provides the ability to test the TSF’s correct operation.
For the user it is important to know which security functions or mechanisms can be tested. The functional
component FPT_TST.1 does not mandate to explicitly specify the security functions being tested. In addition,
FPT_TST.1 requires verification of the integrity of TSF data and of the stored TSF executable code which might
violate the security policy. Therefore, the functional component ”Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)”
of the family TSF self test has been newly created. This component allows that particular parts of the security
mechanisms and functions provided by the TOE are tested.

5.2                Definition of FPT_TST.2
The functional component “Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)” has been newly created (Common
Criteria Part 2 extended). This component allows that particular parts of the security mechanisms and
functions provided by the TOE can be tested after TOE Delivery or are tested automatically and continuously
during normal operation transparent for the user.
This security functional component is used instead of the functional component FPT_TST.1 from Common
Criteria Part 2. For the user it is important to know which security functions or mechanisms can be tested. The
functional component FPT_TST.1 does not mandate to explicitly specify the security functions being tested. In
addition, FPT_TST.1 requires verifying the integrity of TSF data and stored TSF executable code which might
violate the security policy.
The functional component “Subset TOE testing (FPT_TST.2)” is specified as follows (Common Criteria Part 2
extended).

According to [PP0084] Application Note 14 the term “secure state” used by FPT_FLS.1 shall be described and a
definition should be provided.
Definition of secure state:
Secure state describes three different conditions of the TOE:
1. the controller ceases operation. This condition can only be resolved by a cold or warm start of the
   controller. It is triggered by a security reset.
2. the controller enters a security trap. The trap handler can be defined by the user. In case no trap handler is
   provided the first condition is entered.
3. in case of a sudden power loss of the TOE during NVM programming (tearing): the TOE is in a condition to
   either restore the old NVM content or to start with the new programmed value. This condition of security
   state is only provided in case the HSL is part of the TOE and one of the tearing-safe functions of the HSL is
   used.

Note:         a security reset invalidates the RAM content.

Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)

According to [PP0084] Application Note 15, “The Common Criteria suggest that the TOE generates audit data
for the security functional requirements Limited fault tolerance (FRU_FLT.2) and Failure with preservation of
secure state (FPT_FLS.1).” In case of the first two conditions no Audit data are collected, because the effect
entering the secure state is immediately visible. For the third condition indirect audit data is available, i.e. the
user can check, whether new or old NVM data is available.

6.1.2                  Extended Components
An additional family (FCS_RNG) of the Class FCS (cryptographic support) is defined in [PP0084]. This family
describes the functional requirements for random number generation used for cryptographic purposes.
The functional requirements FCS_RNG.1/TRNG, FCS_RNG.1/HPRG, FCS_RNG.1/DRNG, FCS_RNG.1/DRNG4 are
iterations of the FCS_RNG.1 defined in [PP0084] refined in [BSI_RNGs].

FCS_RNG.1.1/TRNG                   The TSF shall provide a physical1 random number generator that implements:
PTG.2.1                            A total failure test detects a total failure of entropy source immediately when the
                                   RNG has started. When a total failure is detected, no random numbers will be
                                   output.
PTG.2.2                            If a total failure of the entropy source occurs while the RNG is being operated, the
                                   RNG prevents the output of any internal random number that depends on some
                                   raw random numbers that have been generated after the total failure of the
                                   entropy source.
PTG.2.3                            The online test shall detect non-tolerable statistical defects of the raw random
                                   number sequence (i) immediately when the RNG has started, and (ii) while the
                                   RNG is being operated. The TSF must not output any random numbers before the
                                   power-up online test has finished successfully or when a defect has been detected.
PTG.2.4                            The online test procedure shall be effective to detect non-tolerable weaknesses of
                                   the random numbers soon.2
PTG.2.5                            The online test procedure checks the quality of the raw random number sequence.
                                   It is triggered continuously. The online test is suitable for detecting non-tolerable
                                   statistical defects of the statistical properties of the raw random numbers within
                                   an acceptable period of time.
FCS_RNG.1.2/TRNG                   The TSF shall provide numbers in the format 8- or 16-bit3 that meet
PTG.2.6                            Test procedure A, as defined in [BSI_AIS31] does not distinguish the internal
                                   random numbers from output sequences of an ideal RNG.
PTG.2.7                            The average Shannon entropy per internal random bit exceeds 0.997.4

PTG.3.1                            A total failure test detects a total failure of entropy source immediately when the

Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)

Note:          The internal random numbers produced by the employed PTG.2-conform PTRNG are adaptively
               compressed raw bits, where the compression rate is controlled by a so-called entropy estimator. The
               concept ensures that the random numbers provided by the PTRNG have high entropy, i.e., each
               delivered random byte will have more the 7.976 bit of entropy. In addition, the PTRNG produced
               random numbers have been tested against test procedures A and B under varying environment
               conditions.

6.1.5                  Memory access control
Usage of multiple applications in one Smartcard often requires code and data separation in order to prevent
that one application can access code and/or data of another application. For this reason the TOE provides Area
based Memory Access Control. The underlying Memory Protection Unit (MPU) is documented in Appendix B3.5
of the ARMv7 M architecture reference manual [ARMv7M].
In particular, the MPU provides full support for:
 Protection regions.
 Overlapping protection regions, with ascending region priority:
  − Region 7 = highest priority.
  − Region 0 = lowest priority.
 Access permissions.
   MPU mismatches and permission violations invoke the programmable-priority MemManage fault handler.

The MPU can be used to:
   Enforce privilege rules, preventing user applications from corrupting operating system data.
   Separate processes, blocking the active task from accessing other tasks’ data.
   Enforce access rules, allowing memory regions to be defined as read-only or detecting unexpected memory
    accesses.

The SFRs are provided by the Memory Access Control Policy (FDP_ACC.1 and dependencies).


6.1.5.1                Subjects, objects and operations of the Memory Access Control Policy

 MPU

Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)

 MPU enable/disable bit.
 8 regions with the following attributes
    − a unique priority
    − the enable bit
    − the xn (execute never) bit
    − the start address and size
    − an access matrix which defines if an Operation of the MPU (Subject) to a memory/code address (Object)
     lying in the region is allowed or denied
 A bit defining the acces behavior of the default region, i.e. memory/code addresses not covered by one of the
  8 MPU regions.


Security Attributes for objects:
There are no security attributes for objects.


6.1.5.3            Access control rules of the Memory Access Control Policy
The following generic rules shall apply in case the MPU is enabled. In case the MPU is disabled, a privileged and
unprivileged code has full read/write/execute rights to all addresses.
 If an address is contained in multiple enabled regions, then the region with the highest priority defines the
    access rights.
   If an address is contained in no region then the default region defines the access rights.
   The region defining the access rights checks if the Subject has access to the Object with respect to the desired
    Operation. In case the access is denied the MPU throws an access violation exception. The checks are done
    according to the access matrix inTable 21.
   overlapping regions, have access to other regions with ascending region priority:
    region 7 = highest priority, region 0 = lowest priority
   execution of code is bound to the read access of Table 21 and the xn bit. If the xn bit is cleared and read
    access is enabled then execution of code is defined by Table 21. If the xn bit is set then execution is never
    allowed.

Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)

6.2.1.1              Implementation representation (ADV_IMP)
The refinement of [PP0084] requires the evaluator to check for completeness. In case of ADV_IMP.2 the entire
implementation representation has to be provided anyhow. A check for completeness is also applicable in case
the entire implementation representation is provided.

6.2.1.2              Life cycle support (ALC_CMS)
The refinement from [PP0084] can also be applied to the assurance level EAL 6 augmented with ALC_CMS.5.
The assurance package ALC_CMS.4 is extended to ALC_CMS.5 with aspects regarding the configuration control
system for the TOE. The refinement is still valid.

6.2.1.3              Configuration management capabilities (ALC_CMC)
The refinement from [PP0084] details, how configuration management has to be also applied to production.
This is also applicable for ALC_CMC.5. ALC_CMC.5 is not specifically focused on production.

6.2.1.4              Test Coverage (ATE_COV)
The refinement in [PP0084] clarifies, how to deal with testing of security mechanisms for physical protection. It
further requests the TOE to be tested under different operating conditions. These refinements are also
applicable for ATE_COV.3, which requires complete TSFI coverage.

6.2.1.5              Functional Specification (ADV_FSP)
The refinement from [PP0084] can also be applied to the assurance level EAL 6 augmented with ADV_FSP.5. The
assurance package ADV_FSP.4 is extended to ADV_FSP.5 with aspects regarding the level of description.
ADV_FSP.5 requires a semi-formal description in addition. The refinement is still valid.
For refinement details see [PP0084].

6.2.2                Security policy model details
EAL6 requires the development of a formal security policy model of the TSF, and establishing a correspondence
between the functional specification and this security policy model. Preserving internal consistency the
security policy model is expected to formally establish the security principles from its characteristics by means
of a mathematical proof.

The table above gives an overview how the security functional requirements are combined to meet the security
objectives. This table has to be read in addition to [PP0084] table 2 “Security Requirements versus Security
Objectives”. The detailed justification is given in the following:
The security functional component Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2) has been newly created (Common
Criteria Part 2 extended). This component allows that particular parts of the security mechanisms and
functions provided by the TOE can be tested after TOE Delivery. This security functional component is used
instead of the functional component FPT_TST.1 from Common Criteria Part 2. For the user it is important to
know which security functions or mechanisms can be tested. The functional component FPT_TST.1 does not
mandate to explicitly specify the security functions being tested. In addition, FPT_TST.1 requires verification of
the integrity of TSF data and stored TSF executable code which might violate the security policy.
The security functional requirement FPT_TST.2 detects attempts to conduce a physical manipulation on the
monitoring functions of the TOE. The objective of FPT_TST.2 is O.Phys-Manipulation.
The security functional requirement “Subset access control (FDP_ACC.1)” with the related Security Function
Policy (SFP) “Memory Access Control Policy” exactly require the implementation of an area based memory
access control as required by O.Mem-Access. The related TOE security functional requirements FDP_ACC.1,
FDP_ACF.1, FMT_MSA.3, FMT_MSA.1, FMT_SMF.1 and FMT_SMR.1 cover this security objective. The
implementation of these functional requirements is represented by the dedicated privilege level concept.
The additional SCL related SFRs support standard TDES and AES encryption and decryption. It also offers MAC
services based on these cryptographic primitives.
The additional cryptographic SFRs related to RSA and ECC are mapped to the respective RSA and ECC
objectives.
The additional loader SFRs describe the Flash Loader roles and the access rules. Therefore these additional
SFRs are mapped to O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader contributing to the aspect “access control for usage of the loader
functionality” as described in [PP0084]. In case EA is chosen, FTP_ITC.1 is not part of the TOE and therefore not

Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)

mapped to O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader. However due to the confidentiality and integrity protection of downloaded
user data andone-way authentication from user towards Flash Loader, the loader can still be controlled in an
effective way and prevent misuse of unauthorized usage.
The loader SFR FTP_ITC.1, FDP_ACC.1/Loader and FDP_ACF.1/Loader describe the requirement of a trusted
channel with role based access control in order to use the loader functionality. This prevents loading of
unauthorized software by unauthorized subjects and maps to O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality. In case EA is chosen,
the Flash Loader requests a one-way authentication instead of a mutual authentication. FTP_ITC.1 is not part
of the TOE. However the objective is still met, because the one-way authentication and role based access
control together with the environmental objective OE.Prevent_Masquerade prevent unauthorized and
manipulative usage.
The justification of the security objective and the additional requirements show that they do not contradict the
rationale already given in [PP0084] for the assumptions, policy and threats defined there.
Nevertheless, the developer of the Smartcard Embedded Software must ensure that the additional functions
are used as specified and that the User Data processed by these functions are protected as defined for the
application context. The TOE only provides the tool to implement the policy defined in the context of the
application.

End of comment.
Comment 2:
The security functional requirement “Cryptographic operation (FCS_COP.1)” met by the TOE has the following
dependencies:
    [FDP_ITC.1 Import of user data without security attributes, or
    FDP_ITC.2 Import of user data with security attributes or
    FCS_CKM.1 Cryptographic key generation]
    FCS_CKM.4 Cryptographic key destruction.
These requirements all address the appropriate management of cryptographic keys used by the specified
cryptographic function. Most requirements concerning key management shall be fulfilled by the environment
since the Smartcard Embedded Software is designed for a specific application context and uses the
cryptographic functions provided by the TOE.
For the security functional requirement FCS_COP.1/SCP/<iteration> and FCS_COP.1/SCL/<iteration> the
respective dependency [FCS_CKM.1 or FDP_ITC.1 or FDP_ITC.2] has to be fulfilled by the environment.
For the security functional requirement FCS_COP.1/RSA/<iteration>, FCS_COP.1/ECC/<iteration> key
generation is also supported by the ACL, therefore the dependency [FCS_CKM.1 or FDP_ITC.1 or FDP_ITC.2] is
met.




The security functional requirement “Cryptographic key destruction (FCS_CKM.4)” met by the TOE has the
following dependencies:
    [FDP_ITC.1 Import of user data without security attributes, or
    FDP_ITC.2 Import of user data with security attributes or
    FCS_CKM.1 Cryptographic key generation]

6.3.2              Rationale of the Assurance Requirements
The chosen assurance level EAL6 is augmented by ALC_FLR.1 in order to meet the assurance expectations
explained in the following paragraphs. In Table 23 the different assurance levels are shown as well as the
augmentations. The augmentations are in compliance with the Protection Profile.
An assurance level EAL6 with the augmentations ALC_FLR.1is required for this type of TOE since it is intended
to defend against highly sophisticated attacks without protective environment. This evaluation assurance
package was selected to permit a developer to gain maximum assurance from positive security engineering
based on good commercial practices. In order to provide a meaningful level of assurance that the TOE provides
an adequate level of defence against such attacks, the evaluators should have access to all information
regarding the TOE including the TSF internals, the low level design and source code including the testing of the
modular design. Additionally the mandatory technical document [JIL_ATT] shall be taken as a basis for the
vulnerability analysis of the TOE.

TOE Summary Specification (ASE_TSS)


7                  TOE Summary Specification (ASE_TSS)
The product overview is given in Section 1.3.1. The Security Features are described below and the relation to
the security functional requirements is shown.
The TOE is equipped with the following security features to meet the security functional requirements:

Table 26      TOE Security Features
 SF_DPM                               Device Phase Management
 SF_PS                                Protection against Snooping
 SF_PMA                               Protection against Modification Attacks
 SF_PLA                               Protection against Logical Attacks
 SF_CS                                Cryptographic Support

The following description of the security features is a complete representation of the TSF.

7.1                SF_DPM: Device Phase Management
The life cycle of the TOE is split up into several phases. . Different operation modes help to protect the TOE
during each phase of its lifecycle.



7.2                SF_PS: Protection against Snooping
The TOE uses various means to protect from snooping of memories and busses and prevents single stepping.

7.3                SF_PMA: Protection against Modifying Attacks
This TOE implements protection against modifying attacks of memories, alarm lines, sensors and instruction
execution order.

7.4                SF_PLA: Protection against Logical Attacks
Memory access of the TOE is controlled by a Memory Protection Unit (MPU), which implements different
priviledge levels. The MPU decides, whether access to a physical memory location is allowed based on access
rights.

7.5                SF_CS: Cryptographic Support
The TOE is equipped with an asymmetric and a symmetric hardware accelerator and also software modules to
support several symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic operations. It further provides random numbers to
meet FCS_RNG.1.



7.6                Assignment of Security Functional Requirements to TOE’s Security
                   Functionality
The justification and overview of the mapping between security functional requirements (SFR) and the TOE’s
security functionality (SF) is given in the sections above. The results are shown in Table 27. The security
functional requirements are addressed by at least one related security feature.

7.7               Security Requirements are internally consistent
For this chapter [PP0084] section 6.3.4 can be applied completely.
The functional requirement FPT_TST.2 requires further protection to prevent manipulation of test results,
while checking the security functions of the TOE. An attacker could aim to switch off or disturb certain sensors
or filters and prevent the detection of distortion by blocking the correct operation of FPT_TST.2. The security
functional requirements required to meet the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing,
O.Malfunction, O.Phys-Manipulation and O.Leak-Forced also protect the security functional requirement
FPT_TST.2. Therefore, the related security functional requirements support the secure implementation and
operation of FPT_TST.2.
The requirement FPT_TST.2 allows testing of some security mechanisms by the Smartcard Embedded Software
after delivery.
The implemented privilege level concept represents the area based memory access protection enforced by the
MPU. As an attacker could attempt to manipulate the level concept as defined and present in the TOE, the
functional requirement FDP_ACC.1 and the related other requirements have to be protected. The security
functional requirements necessary to meet the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing,
O.Malfunction, O.Phys-Manipulation and O.Leak-Forced also protect the area based memory access control
function implemented according to the security functional requirement described in the security functional
requirement FDP_ACC.1 with reference to the Memory Access Control Policy and details given in FDP_ACF.1.
Therefore, those security functional requirements support the secure implementation and operation of
FDP_ACF.1 with its dependent security functional requirements.
