These configurations are based on one or more predefined applets; different configurations might use the
same underlying applet.
The whole applet code resides in the Flash memory; the applets providing these different configurations
are instantiated into Flash memory. Multiple configurations (and hence support for different applications)
can be present at the same time by instantiating multiple applets with their distinct configurations with
some restrictions detailed below. A common combination could be an ICAO MRTD applet and an SSCD ap-
plet providing a travel application with LDS data and EAC authentication together with a signature applica-
tion.
Via configuration the instanciated applets can be tied to the contactless and/or the contact interface, re-
spectively.

1.4.2 TOE definition
The TOE is a combination of hardware and software configured to securely create, use and manage signa-
ture-creation data (SCD). The TOE consists of
       the circuitry of the chip (the integrated circuit, IC) including the contact-based interface with hard-
        ware for the contactless interface including contacts for the antenna, providing basic cryptographic
        functionalities,

Figure 1: Schematic view on the Target of Evaluation (TOE) and its boundaries. The TOE is based on the
certified hardware and Javacard OS. Besides the NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 - cryptovision ePasslet Suite
code in non-volatile memory and the applet instantiated from it which forms the TOE of this security target,
it may also contain additional applets which are not part of the TOE.


The TOE’s functionality claimed by this security target is realized by the NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71
- cryptovision ePasslet Suite in SSCD with key import configuration. The SSCD configuration with key import
provides a PKCS#15 compliant file structure and a separate DF for the SSCD functionality (D.Sig). While D.Sig
provides the TOE’s functionality claimed by this security target, the PKCS#15 part is out of scope of the
certification.

        data (SVD),
       to, optionally, receive and store certificate info,
       to switch the TOE from a non-operational state to an operational state, and
       if in an operational state, to create electronic signatures for data with the following steps:
        a) select an SCD if multiple are present in the SSCD,
        b) authenticate the signatory and determine its intent to sign,
        c) receive data to be signed or a unique representation thereof (DTBS/R)
        d) apply an appropriate cryptographic signature-creation function using the selected SCD to the
           DTBS/R.
The TOE may implement its function for digital signature creation to conform to the specifications in ETSI
TS 101 733 (CAdES) [CADES], ETSI TS 101 903 (XAdES) [XADES] and ETSI TS 101 903 (PADES) [PADES].
The TOE is prepared for the signatory's use by
       import at least one set of SCD, and
       personalising for the signatory by storing in the TOE:
        a) the signatory’s reference authentication data (RAD)
        b) optionally, certificate info for at least one SCD in the TOE.
After preparation the SCD shall be in a non-operational state. Upon receiving a TOE the signatory shall verify
its non-operational state and change the SCD state to operational.

After import the SCD is in a non-operational state. Upon receiving a TOE the signatory shall verify its non-
operational state and change the SCD state to operational.

After preparation the intended legitimate user should be informed of the signatory’s verification authenti-
cation data (VAD) required for use of the TOE in signing. If the VAD is a password or PIN, the means of
providing this information is expected to protect the confidentiality and the integrity of the corresponding
RAD.

If the use of an SCD is no longer required, then it should be destroyed (e.g. by erasing it from memory) as
well as the associated certificate info, if any exists.

1.4.5 Operation of the TOE
This paragraph presents a functional overview of the TOE in its distinct operational environments:


                                                     8 of 82
NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 / SSCD with Key Import Security Target Lite


       The preparation environment, where the TOE interacts with a certification service provider (CSP)
        through a SCD/SVD generation application to import the signature creation data (SCD) and a certif-
        icate generation application (CGA) to obtain a certificate for the signature validation data (SVD)
        corresponding to the SCD the certification service provider has generated. The SCD/SVD generation
        application transmits the SVD to the CGA. The initialisation environment interacts further with the
        TOE to personalise it with the initial value of the reference authentication data (RAD).
       The signing environment where the TOE interacts with a signer through a signature creation appli-
        cation (SCA) to sign data after authenticating the signer as its signatory. The signature creation ap-
        plication provides the data to be signed (DTBS), or a unique representation thereof (DTBS/R) as
        input to the TOE signature creation function and obtains the resulting digital signature2.
       The management environments where the TOE interacts with the user or an SSCD-provisioning ser-
        vice provider to perform management operations, e.g. for the signatory to reset a blocked RAD. A
        single device, e.g. a smart card terminal, may provide the required secure environment for man-
        agement and signing.
The preparation environment, the signing environment and the management environment are secure and
protect data exchanged with the TOE. Figure 3 in prEN 14169-1:2011 illustrates the operational environ-
ment.
The TOE stores signature creation data (SCD) and reference authentication data (RAD). The TOE may store
multiple instances of SCD. In this case the TOE provides a function to identify each SCD and the SCA can
provide an interface to the signer to select an SCD for use in the signature creation function of the SSCD.
The TOE protects the confidentiality and integrity of the SCD and restricts its use in signature creation to its
signatory. The digital signature created by the TOE may be used to create an advanced electronic signature
as defined in Article 5.1 of the [Directive]3. Determining the state of the certificate as qualified is beyond
the scope of this standard.
The signature creation application is assumed to protect the integrity of the input it provides to the TOE
signature creation function as being consistent with the user data authorised for signing by the signatory.
Unless implicitly known to the TOE, the SCA indicates the kind of the signing input (as DTBS/R) it provides
and computes any hash value required. The TOE may augment the DTBS/R with signature parameters it
stores and then computes a hash value over the input as needed by the kind of input and the used crypto-
graphic algorithm.
The TOE stores signatory reference authentication data (RAD) to authenticate a user as its signatory. The
RAD is a password (e.g. PIN), a biometric template or a combination of these. The TOE protects the confi-
dentiality and integrity of the RAD. The TOE may provide a user interface to directly receive verification
authentication data (VAD) from the user, alternatively, the TOE receive the VAD from the signature creation
application (SCA). If the signature creation application handles, is requesting or obtaining a VAD from the
user, it is assumed to protect the confidentiality and integrity of this data.
A certification service provider and a SSCD-provisioning service provider interact with the TOE in the secure
preparation environment to perform any preparation function of the TOE required before control of the
TOE is given to the legitimate user. These functions may include:
       initialising the RAD,
       generating a key pair,

2 At a pure functional level the SSCD creates a digital signature; for an implementation of the SSCD, in that
meeting the requirements of this PP and with the key certificate created as specified in the Directive, Annex
I, the result of the signing process can be used as to create a qualified electronic signature.
3Please note that while this security target - following the according protection profile BSI-CC-PP-0075-
2012-MA-01 - references the [Directive], it also incorporates the requirements of the eIDAS regulation [Re-
gulation] and the according commission implementing regulation [Implementing].

         storing personal information of the legitimate user.
In the case at hand the TOE is a smart card or electronic ID document. In this case a smart-card terminal
may be deployed that provides the required secure environment to handle a request for signatory authori-
zation. A signature can be obtained on a document prepared by a signature-creation application component
running on personal computer connected to the card terminal. The signature creation application, after
presenting the document to the user and after obtaining the authorization PIN initiates the electronic sig-
nature creation function of the smart card through the terminal.
The RAD verification is typically performed by direct PIN verification (VERIFY PIN command); to further pro-
tect the RAD (password or PIN) – especially in a contactless application scenario – the Password Authenti-
cated Connection Establishmanet (PACE) protocol according to [TR03110] can be used.

1.4.6 Major security features of the TOE
The TOE provides the following TOE security functionalities:
         TSF_Access manages the access to objects (files, directories, data and secrets) stored in the applet’s
          file system. It also controls write access of initialization, pre-personalization and personalization
          data4.
         TSF_Admin manages the storage of manufacturing data, pre-personalization data and personaliza-
          tion data.
         TSF_Secret ensures secure management of secrets such as cryptographic keys. This covers secure
          key storage, access to keys as well as secure key deletion. These mechanisms are mainly provided
          by TSF_OS.
         TSF_Crypto performs high level cryptographic operations. The implementation is mainly based on
          the Security Functionalities provided by TSF_OS.
         TSF_SecureMessaging realizes a secure communication channel.
         TSF_Auth realizes two authentication mechanisms: PIN verification and alternatively authentication
          with the PACE protocol.
         TSF_Integrity protects the integrity of internal applet data like the Access control lists.
         TSF_OS contains all security functionalities provided by the certified platform (IC, Javacard opera-
          tion system). The cryptographic operations needed for this TOE are provided by the platform:
              o   Electronic signature-generation with RSA and key sizes of 2000 up to 4096 bit in steps of 1
                  bit, or ECDSA with key sizes of key sizes of 160 bit to 521 bit in steps of one bit.
              o   Secure messaging with AES (128, 192 or 256 bit key length).
              o   PACE authentication with key lengths of 160 bit to 521 bit in steps of one bit (ECC).

1.4.7 TOE life cycle
This paragraph is based on the protection profile [PP0075].

1.4.7.1    General



4 In the context of this security target the three categories are defined as follows: initialization comprises
the preparation of the TOE based on proprietary operations of the platform with the Java Card operation
system; pre-personalization comprises the configuration of the card manager and security domains as well
as the generation of applet instances using Global Platform commands. Personalization is carried out after-
wards using commands of the applet layer of the TOE.

Figure 2: Overview of the development phase of the TOE, which contains development and production
of the TOE. After the secure production following the process certified for the Javacard OS, the chips are
delivered to the SSCD provisioning service using the delivery process already established for the OS. Gray
boxes indicate the steps which are subject to evaluation according to the assurance life cycle (ALC) class.



The development phase is subject of CC evaluation according to the assurance life cycle (ALC) class.


The development phase ends with the delivery of the TOE to an SSCD-provisioning service provider or a

Figure 3: Example of TOE lifecycle following figure 1 of [PP0075]. Note that import of certificate info during
TOE preparation and deletion of certificate info when SCD is destroyed are optional. The delivery to the
SSCD provisioning service after the development phase is also the end of the scope of the certification ac-
cording to Common Criteria.

The operational usage of the TOE comprises the preparation stage and the operational use stage. The TOE
operational use stage begins when the signatory has obtained both the VAD and the TOE. Enabling the TOE
for signing requires at least one set of SCD stored in its memory.
Figure 3 shows an example of the lifecycle where an SCD or SCD/SVD pair is imported from SSCD-
provisioning service before delivery to the signatory. The lifecycle may allow import of SCD or SCD/SVD key
pairs after delivery to the signatory as well.
The TOE life cycle ends when all keys stored in it have been rendered permanently unusable. Rendering a
key in the SSCD unusable may include deletion of any stored corresponding certificate info. The lifecycle
may allow generation of SCD or SCD/SVD key pairs after delivery to the signatory as well.

1.4.7.2   Preparation stage
The preparation phase of the TOE lifecycle is processing the TOE from the customer's acceptance of the
delivered TOE to a state ready for operation by the signatory. The customer receiving the TOE from the


                                                    12 of 82
NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 / SSCD with Key Import Security Target Lite


manufacturer is the SSCD-provisioning service that prepares and provides the SSCD to subscribers. The
preparation includes
         Create and configure the signature application according to AGD_PRE; this step involves applet
          instanciation as well as creation of the file system (card profile).5
         The personalisation of the TOE for use by the signatory, i.e. the installation of the RAD in the TOE
          and handover of VAD to the signatory.
         The initialisation of the TOE, i.e. the CSP generates the SCD/SVD pair by means of a SCD/SVD gen-
          eration device, loads the SCD to the TOE, and sends the SVD to the CGA. The TOE may import and
          store the SCD/SVD pair.
         The generation of the (qualified) certificate containing among others (cf. [1], Annex II)
              a) the SVD which correspond to SCD under the control of the signatory;
              b) the name of the signatory or a pseudonym, which is to be identified as such,
              c) an indication of the beginning and end of the period of validity of the certificate.

         The preparation may include optional loading of the certificate info into the SSCD for signatory con-
          venience.
The CSP generates a SCD/SVD pair and imports SCD, and optionally also SVD, into the SSCD. The CSP ensures
          a) the correspondence between SCD and SVD,
          b) that algorithm and key size for the SVD are appropriate.

Please take note that verifying whether the claimed identity of the signer originates from that given SSCD
has to be done by the CSP operating the CGA.
If the TOE is used for creation of advanced electronic signatures, the certificate links the signature verifica-
tion data to the person (i.e. the signatory) and confirms the identity of that person (cf. [Directive], article 2,
Clause 9).
This security target requires the TOE to provide mechanisms for import of SCD, implementation of the SCD
and personalisation. The environment is assumed to protect all other processes for TOE preparation like
SCD transfer between the SCD/SVD generation device and the TOE, and SVD transfer between the SCD/SVD
generation device and the CGA. The CSP may export the SVD to the TOE for internal use by the TOE (e.g.,
self-test).
Before generating a (qualified) certificate, the CSP is expected to first store the SCD in a SSCD. A secure
channel with the TOE may be used to support this, by ensuring integrity of the SCD during transmission to
the TOE.

1.4.7.3    Operational use stage
In this lifecycle stage the signatory can use the TOE to create advanced electronic signatures.
The operational phase of the TOE starts when at least one SCD/SVD pair is generated by the CSP and the
SCD is imported into the SSCD and when the signatory takes control over the TOE and makes the SCD oper-
ational. The signatory uses the TOE with a trustworthy SCA in a secured environment only. The SCA is as-
sumed to protect the DTBS/R during the transmission to the TOE.




5 This preparation step has been added to the life cycle definition of the underlying Protection Profile and
is necessary to provide the basic functionality (i.e. application and file system) for the following steps. It
may be performed by the SSCD-provisioning service provider directly or by a separate entity (card manu-
facturer).

                                                    13 of 82
NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 / SSCD with Key Import Security Target Lite


The signatory can also interact with the SSCD to perform management tasks, e.g. reset a RAD value or use
counter if the password/PIN in the reference data has been lost or blocked. Such management tasks require
a secure environment.
The signatory can render an SCD in the TOE permanently unusable. Rendering the last SCD in the TOE per-
manently unusable ends the life of the TOE as SSCD.
The TOE may support functions to generate additional signing keys. If the TOE supports these functions it
will support further functions to securely obtain certificates for the new keys. For an additional key the
signatory may be allowed to choose the kind of certificate (qualified, or not) to obtain for the SVD of the
new key. The signatory may also be allowed to choose some of the data in the certificate request for in-
stance to use a pseudonym instead of the legal name in the certificate5. If the conditions to obtain a quali-
fied certificate are met, the new key can also be used to create advanced electronic signatures. The optional
TOE functions for additional key generation and certification may require additional security functions in
the TOE and an interaction with the SSCD-provisioning service provider in an environment that is secure.
The TOE life cycle as SSCD ends when all SCD stored in the TOE are destructed. This may include deletion of
the corresponding certificates.

2.2.5 Assessment of Platform Organisational Security Policies
The Organisational Security Policy “OSP.VERIFICATION” focuses on the integrity of loaded applets, which is
fulfilled by the TOE of this ST since the applet is loaded secured by platform security measures into the flash
memory. This policy does not contradict to the policies of this ST.
The platform ST contains the Organisational Security Policy “OSP.PROCESS-TOE” referring to accurate iden-
tification of each TOE instance. This policy will be fulfilled by a distinct product code for the platform and
for the composite TOE each. This policy does not contradict to the policies of this ST.
The Organisational Security Policy “OSP.KEY-CHANGE” states that initial security domain keys (APSD) shall
be changed before any operation on its Security Domain. This policy does not contradict to the policies of
this ST.
The Organisational Security Policy “OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS” states that security domains can be dynami-
cally created, deleted and blocked during usage phase in post-issuance mode. This policy does not contra-
dict to the policies of this ST.
The Organisational Security Policy “OSP.SECURE-BOX” focuses on the secure box mechanism, which is not
used by the TOE. This policy does not contradict to the policies of this ST.

In the first column, the following table lists all assumptions of the Platform ST. The last column provides an
explanation of relevance for the Composite TOE.


 Platform Assumption                  Relevance for Composite ST
 A.APPLET                             A.APPLET states that applets loaded post-issuance do not contain na-
                                      tive methods. This assumption leads to appropriate directives in the
                                      user guidance [Guidance].
 A.VERIFICATION                       This assumption targets the applet code verification. Regarding post-
                                      issuance loading of third party applets, this assumption leads to ap-
                                      propriate directives in the user guidance [Guidance].
 A.USE_DIAG                           A.USE_DIAG is required in the platform ST to cover secure communi-
                                      cation during packaging, finishing and personalisation. This is re-
                                      flected by appropriate measures in the production and delivery of the
                                      TOE of this ST.
 A.USE_KEYS                           A.USE_KEYS assumes that that the keys which are stored outside the
                                      TOE and which are used for secure communication and authentica-
                                      tion between smart card and terminals are protected for confidenti-
                                      ality and integrity in their own storage environment.
                                      This assumption leads to appropriate directives in the user guidance
                                      [Guidance].
 A.PROCESS-SEC-IC                     A.PPROCESS-SEC-IC of the platform ST states that it is assumed that
                                      security procedures are used after delivery of the TOE by the TOE
                                      Manufacturer up to delivery to the end consumer to maintain confi-
                                      dentiality and integrity of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test
                                      data (to prevent any possible copy, modification, retention, theft or
                                      unauthorised use). This means that the phases after TOE delivery are
                                      assumed to be protected appropriately.
                                      This is reflected by appropriate measures in the production and deliv-
                                      ery of the TOE of this ST.
 A.APPS-PROVIDER                      A.APPS-PROVIDER assumes that the application provider is a trusted
                                      actor that provides basic or secure applications, and that the ap-
                                      plicatrion provider is resposible for his security domain keys.
                                      This leads to appropriate directives in the user guidance [Guidance].
 A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY             A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY assumes that the verification authority is
                                      a trusted actor and able to guarantee and check the digital signature
                                      attached to a basic or secure application. This is reflected by appro-
                                      priate directives in the user guidance [Guidance].

2.2.6.2   Assessment of Platform Objectives for the Operational Environment
There are the following Platform Objectives for the Operational Environment that have to be considered.


 Platform Objective for the Environment                    Relevance for Composite ST
 OE.APPLET                                                 The platform objective for the environment states
                                                           that applets loaded post-issuance do not contain

                                                           ment leads to appropriate directives in the user
                                                           guidance [Guidance].
OE.VERIFICATION                                            The platform objective for the environment tar-
                                                           gets the applet code verification. This is fulfilled by
                                                           the TOE of this ST; regarding third-party-code, this
                                                           objective for the environment leads to appropri-

                                                           There it is stated that all applets loaded to the TOE
                                                           have to be verified.

3 Security problem definition
This chapter has been taken from [PP0075] with minor modifications.


3.1 Assets, users and threat agents
The Common Criteria define assets as entities that the owner of the TOE presumably places value upon. The
term “asset” is used to describe the threats in the operational environment of the TOE.
Assets and objects:
    1. SCD: private key used to perform an electronic signature operation. The confidentiality, integrity
       and signatory’s sole control over the use of the SCD must be maintained.
    2. SVD: public key linked to the SCD and used to perform electronic signature verification. The integrity
       of the SVD when it is exported must be maintained.
    3. DTBS and DTBS/R: set of data, or its representation, which the signatory intends to sign. Their in-
       tegrity and the unforgeability of the link to the signatory provided by the electronic signature must
       be maintained.
User and subjects acting for users:
    1. User: End user of the TOE who can be identified as Administrator or Signatory. The subject S.User
       may act as S.Admin in the role R.Admin or as S.Sigy in the role R.Sigy.
    2. Administrator: User who is in charge to perform the TOE initialisation, TOE personalisation or other
       TOE administrative functions. The subject S.Admin is acting in the role R.Admin for this user after
       successful authentication as Administrator.
    3. Signatory: User who hold the TOE and use it on their own behalf or on behalf of the natural or legal
       person or entity they represent. The subject S.Sigy is acting in the role R.Sigy for this user after
       successful authentication as Signatory.
Threat agents:
    1. Attacker: Human or process acting on their behalf located outside the TOE. The main goal of the
       attacker is to access the SCD or to falsify the electronic signature. The attacker has got a high attack
       potential and knows no secret.


3.2 Threats

3.2.1 T.SCD_Divulg: Storing, copying, and releasing of the signature-creation data
An attacker stores or copies the SCD outside the TOE. An attacker can obtain the SCD during generation,
storage and use for signature-creation in the TOE.

3.2.2 T.SCD_Derive: Derive the signature-creation data
An attacker derives the SCD from publicly known data, such as SVD corresponding to the SCD or signatures
created by means of the SCD or any other data exported outside the TOE, which is a threat against the
secrecy of the SCD.

3.2.3 T.Hack_Phys: Physical attacks through the TOE interfaces
An attacker interacts physically with the TOE to exploit vulnerabilities, resulting in arbitrary security com-
promises. This threat is directed against SCD, SVD and DTBS.

NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 / SSCD with Key Import Security Target Lite


3.2.4 T.SVD_Forgery: Forgery of the signature-verification data
An attacker forges the SVD presented by the CSP to the CGA. This results in loss of SVD integrity in the
certificate of the signatory.

3.2.5 T.SigF_Misuse: Misuse of the signature-creation function of the TOE
An attacker misuses the signature-creation function of the TOE to create a SDO for data the signatory has
not decided to sign. The TOE is subject to deliberate attacks by experts possessing a high attack potential
with advanced knowledge of security principles and concepts employed by the TOE.

3.2.6 T.DTBS_Forgery: Forgery of the DTBS/R
An attacker modifies the DTBS/R sent by the SCA. Thus the DTBS/R used by the TOE for signing does not
match the DTBS the signatory intended to sign.

3.2.7 T.Sig_Forgery: Forgery of the electronic signature
An attacker forges a signed data object, maybe using an electronic signature which has been created by the
TOE, and the violation of the integrity of the signed data object is not detectable by the signatory or by third
parties. The signature created by the TOE is subject to deliberate attacks by experts possessing a high attack
potential with advanced knowledge of security principles and concepts employed by the TOE.


3.3 Organisational Security Policies

3.3.1 P.CSP_QCert: Qualified certificate
The CSP uses a trustworthy CGA to generate a qualified certificate or non-qualified certificate ([Directive]:
2:9, Annex I) for the SVD. The certificates contain at least the name of the signatory and the SVD matching
the SCD implemented in the TOE under sole control of the signatory. The CSP ensures that the use of the
TOE as SSCD is evident with signatures through the certificate or other publicly available information.

3.3.2 P.QSign: Qualified electronic signatures
The signatory uses a signature-creation system to sign data with an advanced electronic signature ([Di-
rective]: 1, 2), which is a qualified electronic signature if it is based on a valid qualified certificate ([Directive],
Annex I). The DTBS are presented to the signatory and sent by the SCA as DTBS/R to the SSCD. The SSCD
creates the electronic signature created with a SCD implemented in the SSCD that the signatory maintain
under their sole control and is linked to the DTBS/R in such a manner that any subsequent change of the
data is detectable.

3.3.3 P.Sigy_SSCD: TOE as secure signature-creation device
The TOE meets the requirements for an SSCD laid down in [Directive], Annex III This implies the SCD is used
for electronic signature creation under sole control of the signatory and the SCD can practically occur only
once.

3.3.4 P.Sig_Non-Repud: Non-repudiation of signatures
The life cycle of the SSCD, the SCD and the SVD shall be implemented in a way that the signatory is not able
to deny having signed data if the signature is successfully verified with the SVD contained in their unrevoked
certificate.

3.4 Assumptions

3.4.1 A.CGA: Trustworthy certificate-generation application
The CGA protects the authenticity of the signatory’s name or pseudonym and the SVD in the (qualified)
certificate by an advanced electronic signature of the CSP.

3.4.2 A.SCA: Trustworthy signature-creation application
The signatory uses only a trustworthy SCA. The SCA generates and sends the DTBS/R of the data the signa-
tory wishes to sign in a form appropriate for signing by the TOE.

3.4.3 A.CSP: Secure SCD/SVD management by CSP
The CSP uses only a trustworthy SCD/SVD generation device and ensures that this device can be used by
authorised user only. The CSP ensures that the SCD generated practically occurs only once, that generated
SCD and SVD actually correspond to each other and that SCD cannot be derived from the SVD. The CSP
ensures the confidentiality of the SCD during generation and export to the TOE, does not use the SCD for
creation of any signature and irreversibly deletes the SCD in the operational environment after export to
the TOE.

4 Security Objectives

4.1 Security Objectives for the TOE

4.1.1 OT.Lifecycle_Security: Lifecycle security
The TOE shall detect flaws during the initialisation, personalisation and operational usage. The TOE shall
securely destroy the SCD on demand of the signatory.
PP application note 1: The TOE may contain more than one set of SCD. There is no need to destroy the SCD
in case of repeated SCD generation. The signatory shall be able to destroy the SCD stored in the SSCD e.g.
after the (qualified) certificate for the corresponding SVD has been expired.

4.1.2 OT.SCD_Auth_Imp: Authorised SCD import
The TOE shall provide security features to ensure that authorised users only may invoke the import of the
SCD.

4.1.3 OT.SCD_Secrecy: Secrecy of the signature creation data
The secrecy of the SCD (used for signature creation) shall be reasonably assured against attacks with a high
attack potential.
PP application note 2: The TOE shall keep the confidentiality of the SCD at all times, in particular during SCD
import, signature creation operation, storage and secure destruction.

4.1.4 OT.Sig_Secure: Cryptographic security of the electronic signature
The TOE shall create digital signatures that cannot be forged without knowledge of the SCD through robust
encryption techniques. The SCD shall not be reconstructable using the digital signatures or any other data
exportable from the TOE. The digital signatures shall be resistant against these attacks, even when executed
with a high attack potential.

4.1.5 OT.Sigy_SigF: Signature creation function for the legitimate signatory only
The TOE shall provide the digital signature creation function for the legitimate signatory only and protects
the SCD against the use of others. The TOE shall resist attacks with high attack potential.

4.1.6 OT.DTBS_Integrity_TOE: DTBS/R integrity inside the TOE
The TOE shall not alter the DTBS/R. As by definition of the DTBS/R this may consist of the DTBS themselves,
this objective does not conflict with a signature creation process where the TOE hashes the provided DTBS
(in part or entirely) for signature creation.

4.1.7 OT.EMSEC_Design: Provide physical emanations security
The TOE shall be designed and built in such a way as to control the production of intelligible emanations
within specified limits.

4.1.8 OT.Tamper_ID: Tamper detection
The TOE shall provide system features that detect physical tampering of its components, and uses those
features to limit security breaches.

NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 / SSCD with Key Import Security Target Lite


4.1.9 OT.Tamper_Resistance: Tamper resistance
The TOE shall prevent or resist physical tampering with specified system devices and components.


4.2 Security Objectives for the Operational Environment

4.2.1 OE.SCD/SVD_Auth_Gen: Authorised SCD/SVD generation
The CSP shall provide security features to ensure that authorised users only may invoke the generation of
the SCD and the SVD.

4.2.2 OE.SCD_Secrecy: SCD Secrecy
The CSP shall protect the confidentiality of the SCD during generation and export to the TOE. The CSP shall
not use the SCD for creation of any signature and shall irreversibly delete the SCD in the operational envi-
ronment after export to the TOE.

4.2.3 OE.SCD_Unique: Uniqueness of the signature creation data
The CSP shall ensure the cryptographic quality of the SCD/SVD pair, which is generated in the environment,
for the qualified or advanced electronic signature. The SCD used for signature creation shall practically occur
only once, i.e. the probability of equal SCDs shall be negligible, and the SCD shall not be reconstructable
from the SVD.

4.2.4 OE.SCD_SVD_Corresp: Correspondence between SVD and SCD
The CSP shall ensure the correspondence between the SVD and the SCD generated by the CSP. This includes
the correspondence between the SVD send to the CGA and the SCD exported to the TOE of the signatory
identified in the SVD certificate.

4.2.5 OE.SVD_Auth: Authenticity of the SVD
The operational environment shall ensure the authenticity of the SVD sent to the CGA of the CSP. The CGA
verifies the correspondence between the SCD in the SSCD of the signatory and the SVD in the qualified
certificate.

4.2.6 OE.CGA_Qcert: Generation of qualified certificates
The CGA shall generate a qualified certificate that includes (amongst others)
    (a) the name of the signatory controlling the TOE,
    (b) the SVD matching the SCD stored in the TOE and being under sole control of the signatory,
    (c) the advanced signature of the CSP.

The CGA shall confirm with the generated qualified certificate that the SCD corresponding to the SVD is
stored in a SSCD.

4.2.7 OE.SSCD_Prov_Service: Authentic SSCD provided by SSCD-provisioning service
The SSCD-provisioning service shall initialise and personalise for the signatory an authentic copy of the TOE
and deliver this copy as SSCD to the signatory.

4.2.8 OE.HID_VAD: Protection of the VAD
If an external device provides the human interface for user authentication, this device shall ensure confi-
dentiality and integrity of the VAD as needed by the authentication method employed from import through
its human interface until import through the TOE interface. In particular, if the TOE requires a trusted chan-
nel for import of the VAD, the HID shall support usage of this trusted channel.

4.2.9 OE.DTBS_Intend: SCA sends data intended to be signed
The signatory shall use a trustworthy SCA that
    (a) generates the DTBS/R of the data that has been presented as DTBS and which the signatory in-
        tends to sign in a form which is appropriate for signing by the TOE,
    (b) sends the DTBS/R to the TOE and enables verification of the integrity of the DTBS/R by the TOE,
    (c) attaches the signature produced by the TOE to the data or provides it separately.

PP application note 3: The SCA should be able to support advanced electronic signatures. Currently, there
exist three formats defined by ETSI recognised as meeting the requirements needed by advanced electronic
signatures: CadES, XadES and PadES. These three formats mandate to include the hash of the signer’s public
key certificate in the data to be signed. In order to support for the mobility of the signer, it is recommended
to store the certificate info on the SSCD for use by SCA and identification of the corresponding SCD if more
than one SCD is stored on the SSCD.

4.2.10 OE.DTBS_Protect: SCA protects the data intended to be signed
The operational environment shall ensure that the DTBS/R cannot be altered in transit between the SCA
and the TOE. In particular, if the TOE requires a trusted channel for import of the DTBS/R, the SCA shall
support usage of this trusted channel.

4.2.11 OE.Signatory: Security obligation of the signatory
The signatory shall check that the SCD stored in the SSCD received from SSCD-provisioning service is in non-
operational state. The signatory shall keep their VAD confidential.

4.3.2 Security Objectives Sufficiency

4.3.2.1   Countering of threats by security objectives:
T.SCD_Divulg (Storing, copying and releasing of the signature creation data) addresses the threat against
the legal validity of electronic signature due to storage and copying of SCD outside the TOE, as expressed in
the Directive [Directive], recital (18). This threat is countered by
- OE.SCD_Secrecy, which assures the secrecy of the SCD in the CSP environment, and
- OT.SCD_Secrecy, which assures the secrecy of the SCD during use by the TOE for signature creation.
Furthermore, generation and/or import of SCD known by an attacker is countered by
OE.SCD/SVD_Auth_Gen, which ensures that only authorised SCD generation in the environment is possible,
and OT.SCD_Auth_Imp, which ensures that only authorised SCD import is possible.
T.SCD_Derive (Derive the signature creation data) deals with attacks on the SCD via public known data
produced by the TOE, which are the SVD and the signatures created with the SCD. OE.SCD_Unique counters
this threat by implementing cryptographically secure generation of the SCD/SVD pair. OT.Sig_Secure en-
sures cryptographically secure electronic signatures.
T.Hack_Phys (Exploitation of physical vulnerabilities) deals with physical attacks exploiting physical vulner-
abilities of the TOE. OT.SCD_Secrecy preserves the secrecy of the SCD. OT.EMSEC_Design counters physical
attacks through the TOE interfaces and observation of TOE emanations. OT.Tamper_ID and
OT.Tamper_Resistance counter the threat T.Hack_Phys by detecting and by resisting tampering attacks.



                                                                                                                                                             40 of 82
NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 / SSCD with Key Import Security Target Lite


T.SVD_Forgery (Forgery of the signature verification data) deals with the forgery of the SVD given to the
CGA for certificate generation. T.SVD_Forgery is addressed by
         OE.SCD_SVD_Corresp, which ensures correspondence between SVD and SCD, and
         OE.SVD_Auth, which ensures the authenticity of the SVD given to the CGA of the CSP.

T.SigF_Misuse (Misuse of the signature creation function of the TOE) addresses the threat of misuse of the
TOE signature creation function to create SDO by others than the signatory to create SDO for data the sig-
natory has not decided to sign, as required by the Directive [Directive], Annex III, paragraph 1, literal (c).
OT.Lifecycle_Security, (Lifecycle security) requires the TOE to detect flaws during the initialisation, person-
alisation and operational usage including secure destruction of the SCD on demand of the signatory.
OT.Sigy_SigF (Signature creation function for the legitimate signatory only) ensures that the TOE provides
the signature creation function for the legitimate signatory only. OE.DTBS_Intend (Data intended to be
signed) ensures that the SCA sends the DTBS/R only for data the signatory intends to sign and
OE.DTBS_Protect counters manipulation of the DTBS during transmission over the channel between the SCA
and the TOE. OT.DTBS_Integrity_TOE (DTBS/R integrity inside the TOE) prevents the DTBS/R from alteration
inside the TOE. If the SCA provides the human interface for the user authentication, OE.HID_VAD (Protection
of the VAD) provides confidentiality and integrity of the VAD as needed by the authentication method em-
ployed. OE.Signatory ensures also that the signatory keep their VAD confidential.
T.DTBS_Forgery (Forgery of the DTBS/R) addresses the threat arising from modifications of the DTBS/R
sent to the TOE for signing which than does not correspond to the DTBS/R corresponding to the DTBS the
signatory intends to sign. The TOE IT environment addresses T.DTBS_Forgery by the means of
         OE.DTBS_Intend, which ensures that the SCA sends only those DTBS intended to be signed by the
          signatory, and
         OE.DTBS_Protect, which ensures that the DTBS/R cannot be altered in transit between the SCA
          and the TOE.

The TOE counters this threat by the means of OT.DTBS_Integrity_TOE by ensuring the integrity of the
DTBS/R inside the TOE.
T.Sig_Forgery (Forgery of the electronic signature) deals with non-detectable forgery of the electronic sig-
nature. OT.Sig_Secure, OE.SCD_Unique and OE.CGA_QCert address this threat in general. OT.Sig_Secure
(Cryptographic security of the electronic signature) ensures by means of robust cryptographic techniques
that the signed data and the electronic signature are securely linked together. OE.SCD_Unique ensures that
the same SCD cannot be generated more than once and the corresponding SVD cannot be included in
another certificate by chance. OE.CGA_QCert prevents forgery of the certificate for the corresponding SVD,
which would result in false verification decision concerning a forged signature.


4.3.2.2    Enforcement of OSPs by security objectives:
P.CSP_QCert (CSP generates qualified certificates) establishes the CSP generating qualified certificate or
non-qualified certificate linking the signatory and the SVD implemented in the SSCD under sole control of
this signatory. P.CSP_QCert is addressed by
         OT.Lifecycle_Security, which requires the TOE to detect flaws during the initialisation, personalisa-
          tion and operational usage,
         OE.SCD/SVD_Auth_Gen, which ensures that the SCD/SVD generation can be invoked by authorised
          users only,
         OT.SCD_Auth_Imp which ensures that authorised users only may invoke the import of the SCD,




                                                    41 of 82
NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 / SSCD with Key Import Security Target Lite


       OE.SCD_SVD_Corresp, which requires the CSP to ensure the correspondence between the SVD and
        the SCD during their generation, and
       OE.CGA_QCert for generation of qualified certificates or non-qualified certificates, which requires
        the CGA to certify the SVD matching the SCD implemented in the TOE under sole control of the
        signatory.
P.QSign (Qualified electronic signatures) provides that the TOE and the SCA may be employed to sign data
with an advanced electronic signature, which is a qualified electronic signature if based on a valid qualified
certificate. OT.Sigy_SigF ensures signatory's sole control of the SCD by requiring the TOE to provide the
signature creation function for the legitimate signatory only and to protect the SCD against the use of oth-
ers. OT.Sig_Secure ensures that the TOE creates electronic signatures, which cannot be forged without
knowledge of the SCD through robust encryption techniques. OE.CGA_QCert addresses the requirement of
qualified or non-qualified electronic certificates building a base for the electronic signature.
OE.DTBS_Intend ensures that the SCA provides only those DTBS to the TOE, which the signatory intends to
sign.
P.Sigy_SSCD (TOE as secure signature creation device) requires the TOE to meet the Annex II of the Di-
rective [Directive]. This is ensured as follows
       OE.SCD_Unique meets the paragraph 1(a) of the Directive [1], Annex III, by the requirements that
        the SCD used for signature creation can practically occur only once.
       OE.SCD_Unique, OT.SCD_Secrecy and OE.SCD_Secrecy meet the paragraph 1(a) of the Directive [1],
        Annex III, by the requirements to ensure the secrecy of the SCD. OT.EMSEC_Design and
        OT.Tamper_Resistance address specific objectives to ensure secrecy of SCD against specific attacks.
       OT.SCD_Secrecy and OT.Sig_Secure meet the paragraph 1(b) of the Directive [1], Annex III, by the
        requirements to ensure that the SCD cannot be derived from SVD, the digital signatures or any other
        data exported outside the TOE.
       OT.Sigy_SigF and OE.SCD_Secrecy meet the paragraph 1(c) of the Directive [1], Annex III, by the
        requirements to ensure that the TOE provides the signature creation function for the legitimate
        signatory only and protects the SCD against the use of others.
       OT.DTBS_Integrity_TOE meets the requirements the paragraph 2 of the Directive [1], Annex III, The
        TOE shall not alter the DTBS/R.
Please take note, the requirements of the Directive [Directive], Annex III, 2., that the SSCD does not prevent
the data to be signed from being presented to the signatory prior to the signature process is obviously
fulfilled by the method of TOE usage: the SCA will present the DTBS to the signatory and send them to the
SSCD for signing.
The usage of SCD under sole control of the signatory sole control is ensured by
       OT.Lifecycle_Security requiring the TOE to detect flaws during the initialisation, personalisation and
        operational usage
       OE.SCD/SVD_Auth_Gen, which limits invocation of the generation of the SCD and the SVD to au-
        thorised users only,
       OT.SCD_Auth_Imp, which limits SCD import to authorised users only,
       OE.SCD_Secrecy, which ensures the confidentiality of the SCD during generation and export to the
        TOE, and deletes the SCD after export to the TOE. The CSP does not use the SCD for signature crea-
        tion.
       OT.Sigy_SigF, which requires the TOE to provide the signature creation function for the legitimate
        signatory only and to protect the SCD against the use of others.

OE.SSCD_Prov_Service ensures that the signatory obtains an authentic copy of the TOE, initialised and per-
sonalised as SSCD from the SSCD-provisioning service.
P.Sig_Non-Repud (Non-repudiation of signatures) deals with the repudiation of signed data by the signa-
tory, although the electronic signature is successfully verified with the SVD contained in their certificate
valid at the time of signature creation. This policy is implemented by the combination of the security objec-
tives for the TOE and its operational environment, which ensures the aspects of signatory’s sole control
over and responsibility for the electronic signatures created with the TOE.
OE.SSCD_Prov_Service ensures that the signatory uses an authentic copy of the TOE, initialised and person-
alised for the signatory.
OE.SCD/SVD_Auth_Gen, OE.SCD_Secrecy and OE.SCD_Unique ensure the security of the SCD in the CSP
environment. OE.SCD_Secrecy ensures the confidentiality of the SCD during generation, during and after
export to the TOE. The CSP does not use the SCD for creation of any signature and deletes the SCD irrevers-
ibly after export to the TOE. OE.SCD_Unique provides that the signatory’s SCD can practically occur just
once. OE.SCD_SVD_Corresp ensures that the SVD in the certificate of the signatory corresponds to the SCD
that is implemented in the copy of the TOE of the signatory.
OE.CGA_QCert ensures that the certificate allows to identify the signatory and thus to link the SVD of the
signatory. OE.SVD_Auth and OE.CGA_QCert require the environment to ensure the authenticity of the SVD
as being exported by the TOE under sole control of the signatory. OE.CGA_QCert ensures that the certificate
allows to identify the signatory and thus to link the SVD of the signatory. OE.SVD_Auth and OE.CGA_QCert
require the environment to ensure the authenticity of the SVD as being exported by the TOE under sole
control of the signatory.
OE.Signatory ensures that the signatory checks that the SCD, stored in the SSCD received from an SSCD-
provisioning service is in non-operational state (i.e. the SCD cannot be used before the signatory becomes
into sole control over the SSCD). OT.Sigy_SigF provides that only the signatory may use the TOE for signature
creation. OE.DTBS_Intend, OE.DTBS_Protect and OT.DTBS_Integrity_TOE ensure that the TOE creates elec-
tronic signatures only for those DTBS/R, which the signatory has decided to sign as DTBS. The robust cryp-
tographic techniques required by OT.Sig_Secure ensure that only this SCD may create a valid electronic
signature that can be successfully verified with the corresponding SVD used for signature verification. The
security objective for the TOE OT.Lifecycle_Security (Lifecycle security), OT.SCD_Secrecy (Secrecy of the sig-
nature creation data), OT.EMSEC_Design (Provide physical emanations security), OT.Tamper_ID (Tamper
detection) and OT.Tamper_Resistance (Tamper resistance) protect the SCD against any compromise.



4.3.2.3   Upkeep of assumptions by security objectives:
A.SCA (Trustworthy signature creation application) establishes the trustworthiness of the SCA with respect
to generation of DTBS/R. This is addressed by OE.DTBS_Intend (Data intended to be signed) which ensures
that the SCA generates the DTBS/R of the data that have been presented to the signatory as DTBS and which
the signatory intends to sign in a form which is appropriate for being signed by the TOE.
A.CGA (Trustworthy certificate generation application) establishes the protection of the authenticity of
the signatory's name and the SVD in the qualified certificate by the advanced signature of the CSP by means
of the CGA. This is addressed by OE.CGA_QCert (Generation of qualified certificates), which ensures the
generation of qualified certificates, and by OE.SVD_Auth (CGA proves the authenticity of the SVD), which
ensures the verification of the authenticity of the received SVD and the correspondence between the SVD
and the SCD that is implemented by the SSCD of the signatory.
A.CSP (Secure SCD/SVD management by CSP) establishes several security aspects concerning handling of
SCD and SVD by the CSP. That the SCD/SVD generation device can only be used by authorised users is ad-
dressed by OE.SCD/SVD_Auth_Gen (Authorised SCD/SVD Generation), that the generated SCD is unique and
cannot be derived by the SVD is addressed by OE.SCD_Unique (Uniqueness of the signature creation data),

that SCD and SVD correspond to each other is addressed by OE.SCD_SVD_Corresp (Correspondence be-
tween SVD and SCD), and that the SCD are kept confidential, are not used for signature generation in the
environment and are deleted in the environment once exported to the TOE is addressed by OE.SCD_Secrecy
(SCD Secrecy).

5 Extended Component Definition

5.1 Definition of the Family FPT_EMS
The additional family FPT_EMS (TOE Emanation) of the Class FPT (Protection of the TSF) is defined here to
describe the IT security functional requirements of the TOE. The TOE shall prevent attacks against the SCD
and other secret data where the attack is based on external observable physical phenomena of the TOE.
Examples of such attacks are evaluation of TOE’s electromagnetic radiation, simple power analysis (SPA),
differential power analysis (DPA), timing attacks, radio emanation etc. This family describes the functional
requirements for the limitation of intelligible emanations. The family FPT_EMS belongs to the Class FPT
because it is the class for TSF protection. Other families within the Class FPT do not cover the TOE emana-
tion.

5.2 Definition of the Family FCS_RND
To define the IT security functional requirements of the TOE a sensitive family (FCS_RND) of the Class FCS
(cryptographic support) is defined here7. This family describes the functional FCS_RND is not limited to gen-
eration of cryptographic keys unlike the component FCS_CKM.1.
The family “Generation of random numbers (FCS_RND)” is specified as follows.

5.2.1 FCS_RND Generation of random numbers
Family behavior
This family defines quality requirements for the generation of random numbers which are intended to be
used for cryptographic purposes.
Component leveling:

FCS_RND.1                Generation of random numbers requires that random numbers meet a defined
                         quality metric.
Management:              FCS_RND.1

6 IT Security Requirements

6.1 General
This chapter gives the security functional requirements and the security assurance requirements for the
TOE.
Section 6.2 provides the security functional requirements.
The TOE security assurance requirements statement is given in section 6.3.


6.2 TOE Security Functional Requirements

6.2.1 Use of requirement specifications
The CC allows several operations to be performed on functional requirements; refinement, selection, as-
signment, and iteration are defined in paragraph C.4 of Part 1 [CC_1] of the CC. Each of these operations is
used in this ST and the underlying PP.
Operations already performed in the underlying PP [PP0075] are uniformly marked by bold italic font style;
for further information on details of the operation, please refer to [PP0075].
Operations performed within this security target are marked by bold underlined font style; further infor-
mation on details of the operation is provided in foot notes.

10   [assignment: cryptographic algorithm]
11   [assignment: cryptographic key sizes]
12   [assignment: list of standards]
 The combination of the two cryptographic algorithms with an „or“ is due to the fact that the final TOE
13

may be configured in a way that only one of the two cryptographic algorithms is activated.

Application note: The elliptic curves corresponding to the key sizes are defined in FCS_COP.1.1/SIG.
Application note: BSI-TR-03110 [TR03110] allows arbitrary combinations of ECC key sizes and AES key
lengths in the PACE protocol. It should be noted that ECC key lengths smaller than the AES key length will
lead to a reduced AES key space (e.g. a 224 bit entropy in a 256 bit AES key).


6.2.2.4       FCS_RND.1: Quality metric for random numbers
Hierarchical to:           No other components.
Dependencies:              No dependencies.
FCS_RND.1.1                The TSF shall provide a mechanism to generate random numbers that meet the
                           AIS20/31 Class DRG.3 quality metric14.


Application note: This SFR was added to the standard set of SFRs to address the requirements of the PACE
protocol. The random number generation is provided by the underlying NXP JCOP4 P71 platform.
Developer note: The corresponding platform SFR (FCS_RNG.1) states that the platform provides a deter-
ministic random number generator (RNG) that fulfills the following:
          (DRG.3.1) If initialized with a random seed using a PTRNG of class PTG.2 (as defined in [AIS20]) as
           random source, the internal state of the RNG shall have at least 256 bit of entropy.
          (DRG.3.2) The RNG provides forward secrecy (as defined in [AIS20]).
          (DRG.3.3) The RNG provides enhanced backward secrecy even if the current internal state is
           known (as defined in [AIS20])
          (DRG.3.4) The RNG, initialized with a random seed using a PTRNG of class PTG.2 (as defined in
           [AIS20]) as random source, generates output for which for AES-mode 248 and for TDEA-mode 235
           strings of bit length 128 are mutually different with probability at least 1 - 224.
          (DRG.3.5) Statistical test suites cannot practically distinguish the random numbers from output
           sequences of an ideal RNG. The random numbers must pass test procedure A (as defined in
           [AIS20]).

PACE protocol.
Developer note: The blocking of the RAD after the defined number of unsuccessful authentication attempts
can – depending on the configuration and the specific configuration data – be permanent or unblocked with
a personal unblocking key (PUK). The RAD should have a minimum of six digits. The probability to guess a
PIN value by repeated tries shall be equal or less than 3 x 10-6. An optional PUK should have a minimum
size of 10 digits and the usage counter of the PUK should be restricted to a maximum of 20. If a PUK is used,
the PUK shall be held secret or the RAD shall have a sufficient length to achieve that the probability to guess
a PIN value by repeated tries and PUK usage is equal or less than 3 x 10-6.

PP application note 15: The TOE shall prevent attacks against the SCD and other secret data where the
attack is based on external observable physical phenomena of the TOE. Such attacks may be observable at
the interfaces of the TOE or may origin from internal operation of the TOE or may origin by an attacker that
varies the physical environment under which the TOE operates. The set of measurable physical phenomena
is influenced by the technology employed to implement the TOE. Examples of measurable phenomena are
variations in the power consumption, the timing of transitions of internal states, electromagnetic radiation
due to internal operation, radio emission.
Due to the heterogeneous nature of the technologies that may cause such emanations, evaluation against
state-of-the-art attacks applicable to the technologies employed by the TOE is assumed. Examples of such
attacks are, but are not limited to, evaluation of TOE’s electromagnetic radiation, simple power analysis
(SPA), differential power analysis (DPA), timing attacks, etc.

                                    curity IC26 by responding automatically such that the SFRs are always en-
                                    forced.


PP application note 17: The TOE will implement appropriate measures to continuously counter physical
tampering which may compromise the SCD. The “automatic response” in the element FPT_PHP.3.1 means
(i) assuming that there might be an attack at any time and (ii) countermeasures are provided at any time.
Due to the nature of these attacks the TOE can by no means detect attacks on all of its elements (e.g. the
TOE is destroyed). But physical tampering shall not reveal information of the SCD. E.g. the TOE may be
physically tampered in power-off state of the TOE (e.g. a smart card), which does not allow TSF for over-
writing the SCD but leads to physical destruction of the memory and all information therein about the SCD.
In case of physical tampering the TFS may not provide the intended functions for SCD/SVD pair generation
or signature creation but ensures the confidentiality of the SCD by blocking these functions. The SFR
FPT_PHP.1 requires the TSF to react on physical tampering in a way that the signatory is able to determine
whether the TOE was physical tampered or not. E.g. the TSF may provide an appropriate message during
start-up or the guidance documentation may describe an failure of TOE start-up as indication of physical
tampering.

6.4.2 TOE Security Requirements Sufficiency
OT.Lifecycle_Security (Lifecycle security) is provided by the SFR as follows.




                                                                      61 of 82
NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 / SSCD with Key Import Security Target Lite


The SCD import is controlled by TSF according to FDP_ACC.1/SCD_Import, FDP_ACF.1/SCD_Import and
FDP_ITC.1/SCD. The confidentiality of the SCD is protected during import according to FDP_UCT.1/SCD in
the trusted channel FTP_ICT.1/SCD.
The secure SCD usage is ensured cryptographically according to FCS_COP.1. The SCD usage is controlled by
access control FDP_ACC.1/Signature_Creation, FDP_AFC.1/Signature_Creation which is based on the secu-
rity attribute secure TSF management according to FMT_MOF.1, FMT_MSA.1/Admin,
FMT_MSA.1/Signatory,         FMT_MSA.2,        FMT_MSA.3,         FMT_MSA.4,         FMT_MTD.1/Admin,
FMT_MTD.1/Signatory. The FMT_SMF.1 and FMT_SMR.1 defines security management rules and functions.
The test functions FPT_TST.1 provides failure detection throughout the lifecycle. The SFR FCS_CKM.4 en-
sures a secure SCD destruction.
OT.SCD_Auth_Imp (Authorised SCD import) is provided by the security functions specified by the following
SFR. FIA_UID.1 and FIA_UAU.1 ensure that the user is identified and authenticated before SCD can be im-
ported. FDP_ACC.1/SCD_Import and FDP_ACF.1/SCD_Import ensure that only authorised users can import
SCD.
OT.SCD_Secrecy (Secrecy of signature creation data) is provided by the security functions specified by the
following SFR. FDP_UCT.1/SCD and FTP_ICT.1/SCD ensures the confidentiality for SCD import.
The security functions specified by FDP_RIP.1 and FCS_CKM.4 ensure that residual information on SCD is
destroyed after the SCD has been use for signature creation and that destruction of SCD leaves no residual
information.
The security functions specified by FDP_SDI.2/Persistent ensure that no critical data is modified which could
alter the efficiency of the security functions or leak information of the SCD. FPT_TST.1 tests the working
conditions of the TOE and FPT_FLS.1 guarantees a secure state when integrity is violated and thus assures
that the specified security functions are operational. An example where compromising error conditions are
countered by FPT_FLS.1 is fault injection for differential fault analysis (DFA).
The SFR FPT_EMS.1 and FPT_PHP.3 require additional security features of the TOE to ensure the confiden-
tiality of the SCD.
OT.Sig_Secure (Cryptographic security of the electronic signature) is provided by the cryptographic algo-
rithms specified by FCS_COP.1, which ensure the cryptographic robustness of the signature algorithms.
FDP_SDI.2/Persistent corresponds to the integrity of the SCD implemented by the TOE and FPT_TST.1 en-
sures self-tests ensuring correct signature creation.
OT.Sigy_SigF (Signature creation function for the legitimate signatory only) is provided by SFR for identifi-
cation authentication and access control.
The FIA_UAU.1 and FIA_UID.1 that ensure that no signature creation function can be invoked before the
signatory is identified and authenticated. The security functions specified by FMT_MTD.1/Admin and
FMT_MTD.1/Signatory manage the authentication function. The SFR FIA_AFL.1 provides protection against
a number of attacks, such as cryptographic extraction of residual information, or brute force attacks against
authentication. The security function specified by FDP_SDI.2/DTBS ensures the integrity of stored DTBS.
The security functions specified by FDP_ACC.1/Signature_Creation and FDP_ACF.1/Signature_Creation pro-
vide access control based on the security attributes managed according to the SFR FMT_MTD.1/Signatory,
FMT_MSA.1/Signatory, FMT_MSA.2, FMT_MSA.3 and FMT_MSA.4. FMT_MOF.1 ensures that only the sig-
natory can enable/disable the signature creation function. The SFR FMT_SMF.1 and FMT_SMR.1 list these
management functions and the roles. These ensure that the signature process is restricted to the signatory.
Furthermore, the security functionality specified by FDP_RIP.1 will ensure that no attacker can get hold of
the SCD (to create signatures outside the TOE) once SCD have been deleted by the legitimate signatory.
For variants with a contactless interface, FCS_COP.1/PACE and FCS_RND.1 secure the transmission of the
RAD (e.g. PIN) and the set-up of a secure messaging channel. These SFRs are not required for other variants
of the TOE.

OT.DTBS_Integrity_TOE (DTBS/R integrity inside the TOE) ensures that the DTBS/R is not altered by the
TOE. The verification that the DTBS/R has not been altered by the TOE is provided by integrity functions
specified by FDP_SDI.2/DTBS.
OT.EMSEC_Design (Provide physical emanations security) covers that no intelligible information is ema-
nated. This is provided by FPT_EMS.1.1.
OT.Tamper_ID (Tamper detection) is provided by FPT_PHP.1 by the means of passive detection of physical
attacks.
OT.Tamper_Resistance (Tamper resistance) is provided by FPT_PHP.3 to resist physical attacks.

Justification for non-satisfied dependencies between the SFR for TOE:
•       No. 1: The PACE authentication protocol uses specific RAD (e.g. a PIN) as equivalent of a crypto-
        graphic key. Therefore neither a key generation (FCS_CKM.1) nor an import (FDP_ITC.1/2) is neces-
        sary.

6.4.4 Rationale for EAL 5 Augmented
The assurance level for the protection profile [PP0075] is EAL4 augmented with AVA_VAN.5. This security
target enhances the security level by choosing EAL 5 augmented with AVA_VAN.5 and ALC_DVS.2 due to
market demands.
Augmentation results from the selection of:
                AVA_VAN.5 Advanced methodical vulnerability analysis

NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 / SSCD with Key Import Security Target Lite


                ALC_DVS.2 Sufficiency of security measures
The TOE is intended to function in a variety of signature creation systems for qualified electronic signatures.
Due to the nature of its intended application, i.e., the TOE may be issued to users and may not be directly
under the control of trained and dedicated administrators. As a result, it is imperative that misleading, un-
reasonable and conflicting guidance is absent from the guidance documentation, and that secure proce-
dures for all modes of operation have been addressed. Insecure states should be easy to detect.
The TOE shall be shown to be highly resistant to penetration attacks to meet the security objectives
OT.SCD_Secrecy, OT.Sigy_SigF and OT.Sig_Secure. The component AVA_VAN.5 has the following depend-
encies:
       ADV_ARC.1 Architectural Design with domain separation and non-bypassability
       ADV_FSP.4 Complete functional specification
       ADV_TDS.3 Basic modular design
       ADV_IMP.1 Implementation representation of the TSF
       AGD_OPE.1 Operational user guidance
       AGD_PRE.1 Preparative procedures
       ATE_DPT.1 Testing: basic design
All of these dependencies are met or exceeded in the EAL5 assurance package.
The component ALC_DVS.2 has no dependencies.

7 TOE summary specification

7.1 Security Functionality

7.1.1 TSF_Access: Access rights
This security functionality manages the access to objects (files, directories, data and secrets) stored in the
applet’s file system. It also controls write access of initialization, pre-personalization and personalization
data. Access control for initialization and pre-personalization in the preparation phase – while the actual
applet is not yet present – is based on platform functionality and on the card manager of the underlying
NXP JCOP4 P71 Java Card platform (SF.CM).
It allows among others the maintenance of different users (Administrator, Signatory). Access is granted (or
denied) in accordance to access rights that depend on appropriate identification and authentication mech-
anisms.
TSF_Access covers the following SFRs:
       FDP_ACC.1.1/ SCD_Import requires that the TSF shall enforce the SCD_Import_SFP on subjects:
        S.User, objects: SCD, and operations: import of SCD. Access to these operations is realized by

the card manager of the underlying NXP JCOP4 P71 Java Card platform (SF.CM). During Operational Use
phase, read access is only possible after successful authentication.

7.1.6 TSF_Auth: Authentication protocols
This security function realizes the following two configurable mechanisms based on the standard ISO7816
Verify_PIN command (for contact interface only) and on the PACE protocol:

       TSF_Auth_VERIFY_PIN
        TSF_Auth_PIN performs the VERIFY PIN (RAD) authentication mechanism.

       TSF_Auth_PACE
        TSF_Auth_PACE provides an additional authentication mechanism based on the PACE protocol
        [TR03110]. It is used for secure PIN entry especially over contactless interface. To prevent denial of
        service attacks on the PACE PIN (that could be performed unnoticed via contactless interface), the
        suspend mode as defined in TR03110 [TR03110] is used. After two consecutive unsuccessful PIN
        verification attempts the PIN will be suspended and can only be verified after successful verification
        of an additional PIN (e.g. Card Access Number, CAN).
        Note that TSF_Auth contains two configurable mechanisms (cf. chapter 7) based on the standard
        ISO7816 Verify_PIN command (for contact interface only) and on the PACE protocol.

       FDP_ACF.1.2/SCD_Import requires that the TSF shall enforce the following rules to determine if an
        operation among controlled subjects and controlled objects is allowed: S.User with the security at-

        objects based on the following: (1) the user S.User is associated with the security attribute “Role”
        and (2) the signature creation data (SCD) with the security attribute “SCD Operational”. This is real-
        ized by TSF_Auth and TSF_Access.
       FDP_ACF.1.2/Signature-creation requires that the TSF shall enforce the following rules to determine
        if an operation among controlled subjects and controlled objects is allowed: R.Sigy is allowed to

        “SCD operational” is set to “yes”. This is realized by TSF_Auth and TSF_Access.

The Javacard operation system (part of the TOE) features the following Security Functionalities. The exact
description can be found in the Javacard OS security target [ST_OS]; the realization is partly based on the
security functions of the certified IC platform:
       Applet firewall (SF.Firewalll)
       Secure overwriting of data (SF.RIP)
       Atomicity and rollback mechanism for Global Platform management functions (SF.Rollback)
       Secure channel protocols (SF.SCP)
       Access control policy for Global Platform card management functions (SF.CM)
       Security measures against physical tampering and leakage (SF.Physical)

ities and thus the fulfillment of all SFRs has dependencies to TSF_OS. The following items list all SFRs where
TSF_OS has an impact above this level:
       FCS_CKM.4.1 requires that the TSF shall destroy cryptographic keys in accordance with a specified
        cryptographic key destruction method. This is realized in the security functions provided by TSF_OS
        (and TSF_Secret).
       FCS_COP.1/PACE requires that for variants with the contactless interface the TOE must provide
        the PACE authentication protocol. This is realized using security functionality provided by TSF_OS.

       FCS_COP.1.1/SIG requires that the TSF shall perform electronic signature-generation in accordance
        with specified cryptographic signature generation algorithms and specified cryptographic key sizes.
        This is realized by TSF_OS.
       FCS_RND.1 requires that the TSF should provide random numbers with a defined quality metric.
        This is provided by TSF_OS.
       FDP_SDI.2.2/Persistent requires that upon detection of a data integrity error, the TSF shall (1) pro-
        hibit the use of the altered data and (2) inform the S.Sigy about integrity error. This is realized by
        TSF_Integrity and TSF_OS.

       FDP_SDI.2.1/DTBS requires that the TSF shall monitor user data stored in containers controlled by
        the TSF for integrity error on all objects, based on the following attributes: integrity checked stored
        DTBS. This is realized by TSF_Integrity and TSF_OS.
       FDP_SDI.2.2/DTBS requires that upon detection of a data integrity error, the TSF shall (1) prohibit
        the use of the altered data and (2) inform the S.Sigy about integrity error. This is realized by
        TSF_Integrity and TSF_OS.
       FPT_EMS.1.1 requires that the TOE shall not variations in power consumption, electromagnetic ra-
        diation or timing during command execution in excess of non-useful information enabling access to
        RAD and SCD. This is mainly realized by appropriate measures in TSF_OS together with the strict
        following of the security implementation guidelines of the Javacard platform.
       FPT_EMS.1.2 requires that the TSF shall ensure any users are unable to use the following interface:
        smart card circuit contacts or contactless interface to gain access to RAD and SCD. This is mainly
        realized by appropriate measures in TSF_OS together with the strict following of the security imple-
        mentation guidelines of the Javacard platform.
       FPT_FLS.1.1 requires that the TSF shall preserve a secure state when the following types of failures
        occur: (1) self-test according to FPT_TST fails, or (2) exposure to out-of-range operating conditions
        where therefore a malfunction could occur. This is realized by TSF_OS (together with and
        TSF_Integrity).
       FPT_PHP.1.1 requires that the TSF shall provide unambiguous detection of physical tampering that
        might compromise the TSF. This all is realized by TSF_OS, in parts due to the characteristics of the
        hardware platform.
       FPT_PHP.1.2 requires that the TSF shall provide the capability to determine whether physical tam-
        pering with the TSF’s devices or TSF’s elements has occurred. This all is realized by TSF_OS, in parts
        due to the characteristics of the hardware platform.
       FPT_PHP.3.1 requires that the TSF shall resist physical manipulation and physical probing to the TSF
        by responding automatically such that the SFRs are always enforced. This all is realized by TSF_OS,
        in parts due to the characteristics of the hardware platform.
       FPT_TST.1.1 requires that the TSF shall run a suite of self-tests periodically during normal operation
        to demonstrate the correct operation of the TSF. This is realized by TSF_OS.
       FPT_TST.1.2 requires that the TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to verify the
        integrity of TSF data. This is realized by TSF_OS.
       FPT_TST.1.3 requires that the TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to verify the
        integrity of TSF. This is realized by TSF_OS.


7.2 TOE summary specification rationale
This summary specification shows that the TSF and assurance measures are appropriate to fulfill the TOE
security requirements.

7.2.1 Mapping of TOE Security Requirements and TOE Security Functionalities
Each TOE security functional requirement is implemented by at least one security functionality. The map-
ping of TOE Security Requirements and TOE Security Functionalities is given in the following table. If itera-
tions of a TOE security requirement are covered by the same TOE security functionality the mapping will
appear only once. The description of the TSF is given in section 7.1.

Glossary
The following glossary lists the main abbreviations and gives terms and definitions. It includes the terms
and definitions given in [PP0075], chapter 3.2.3 and 4.


Administrator                 User who performs TOE initialisation, TOE personalisation, or other TOE ad-
                              ministrative functions
Advanced electronic sig-      Electronic signature which meets specific requirements in [Directive]. Ac-
nature                        cording to the Directive a electronic signature qualifies as an electronic
                              signature if it:
                                      is uniquely linked to the signatory;
                                      is capable of identifying the signatory;
                                      is created using means that the signatory can maintain under his
                                       sole control, and
                                      is linked to the data to which it relates in such a manner that any
                                       subsequent change of the data is detectable.
Authentication data           Information used to verify the claimed identity of a user
Authentication                Authentication defines a procedure that verifies the identity of the commu-
                              nication partner. The most elegant method is based on the use of so called
                              electronic signatures.
CA                            Certification authority.
CC                            Common criteria.
Certificate                   Electronic signature used as electronic attestation binding an SVD to a person
                              confirming the identity of that person as legitimate signer ([Directive]: 2.9).
Certificate info              Information associated with a SCD/SVD pair that may be stored in a secure
                              signature creation device. Certificate info is either
                                      a signer's public key certificate or,
                                      one or more hash values of a signer's public key certificate together
                                       with an identifier of the hash function used to compute the hash val-
                                       ues.
                              Certificate info may be combined with information to allow the user to dis-
                              tinguish between several certificates.
Certificate generation ap- Collection of application components that receive the SVD from the SSCD to
plication (CGA)            generate a certificate obtaining data to be included in the certificate and to

Data to be signed or its      Data received by a secure signature creation device as input in a single signa-
unique representation         ture-creation operation. Note: DTBS/R is either
DTBS/R                                a hash-value of the data to be signed (DTBS), or
                                      an intermediate hash-value of a first part of the DTBS complemented
                                       with a remaining part of the DTBS, or
                                      the DTBS.
DTBS                          Data to be signed.
DTBS/R                        Data to be signed or its unique representation.
EAL                           Evaluation assurance level.
ECC                           (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) class of procedures providing an attractive al-
                              ternative for the probably most popular asymmetric procedure, the RSA al-
                              gorithm.
Hash function                 A function which forms the fixed-size result (the hash value) from an arbitrary
                              amount of data (which is the input). These functions are used to generate the
                              electronic equivalent of a fingerprint. The significant factor is that it must be
                              impossible to generate two entries which lead to the same hash value (so
                              called collisions) or even to generate a matching message for a defined hash
                              value.
Integrity                     The test on the integrity of data is carried out by checking messages for
                              changes during the transmission by the receiver. Common test procedures
                              employ Hashfunctions, MACs (Message Authentication Codes) or – with ad-
                              ditional functionality – electronic signatures.
IT                            Information technology.
Javacard                      A smart card with a Javacard operation system.
Legitimate user               User of a secure signature creation device who gains possession of it from an
                              SSCD-provisioning service provider and who can be authenticated by the
                              SSCD as its signatory.
MAC                           Message Authentication Code. Algorithm that expands the message by
                              means of a secret key by special redundant pieces of information, which are
                              stored or transmitted together with the message. To prevent an attacker
                              from targeted modification of the attached redundancy, requires its protec-
                              tion in a suitable way.
Non-repudiation               One of the objectives in the employment of digital signatures. It describes the
                              fact that the sender of a message is prevented from denying the preparation
                              of the message. The problem cannot be simply solved with cryptographic rou-
                              tines, but the entire environment needs to be considered and respective
                              framework conditions need to be provided by pertinent laws.
Notified body                 Organizational entity designated by a member state of the European Union
                              as responsible for accreditation and algorithms and algorithm parameters
                              ([Directive]: 1.1b and 3.4).
PP                            Protection profile.
Private key                   Secret key only known to the receiver of a message, which is used in asym-
                              metric ciphers for encryption or generation of electronic signatures.
Pseudo random number          Many cryptographic mechanisms require random numbers (e.g. in key gen-
                              eration). The problem, however, is that it is difficult to implement true ran-



                                                    80 of 82
NXP eDoc Suite v3.5 on JCOP4 P71 / SSCD with Key Import Security Target Lite


                              dom numbers in software. Therefore, so called pseudo-random number gen-
                              erators are used, which then should be initialized with a real random element
                              (the so called seed).
Public key                    Publicly known key in an asymmetric cipher which is used for encryption and
                              verification of electronic signatures.
Public key infrastructure     Combination of hardware and software components, policies, and different
(PKI)                         procedures used to manage electronic certificates.
Qualified certificate         Public key certificate that meets the requirements laid down in [Directive],
                              Annex I and that is provided by a CSP that fulfils the requirements laid down
                              in [Directive], Annex II.
Qualified electronic signa- advanced electronic signature that has been created with an SSCD with a key
ture                        certified with a qualified certificate ([Directive]: 5.1).
RAD                           Reference authentication data.
Random numbers                Many cryptographic algorithms or protocols require a random element,
                              mostly in form of a random number, which is newly generated in each case.
                              In these cases, the security of the procedure depends in part on the suitability
                              of these random numbers. As the generation of real random numbers within
                              computers still imposes a problem (a source for real random events can in
                              fact only be gained by exact observation of physical events, which is not easy
                              to realize for a software), so called pseudo random numbers are used instead.
Reference authentication      Data persistently stored by the TOE for authentication of a user as authorised
data (RAD)                    for a particular role.
SCA                           Signature creation application.

                                       ate, e.g. as attachment to the DTBS.
Signature creation data       Private cryptographic key stored in the SSCD under exclusive control by the
(SCD)                         signatory to create an electronic signature ([Directive]: 2.4).
Signature creation system Complete system that creates an electronic signature consists of the SCA and
(SCS)                     the SSCD.
Signature verification        Public cryptographic key that can be used to verify an electronic signature
data (SVD)                    ([Directive] 2.7).
Smart card                    A smart card is a chip card which contains an internal micro controller with
                              CPU, volatile (RAM) and non-volatile (ROM, EEPROM, Flash) memory, i.e.
                              which can carry out its own calculations in contrast to a simple storage card.
                              Sometimes a smart card has a numerical coprocessor (NPU) to execute public
                              key algorithms efficiently. Smart cards have all of their functionality com-
                              prised on a single chip (in contrast to chip cards, which contain several chips
                              wired to each other). Therefore, such a smart card is ideal for use in cryptog-
                              raphy as it is almost impossible to manipulate its internal processes.
SSCD                          Secure signature creation device.
SSCD provisioning service     Service to prepare and provide an SSCD to a subscriber and to support the
                              signatory with certification of generated keys and administrative functions of
                              the SSCD.
ST                            Security target.
SVD                           Signature verification data.
TOE                           Target of evaluation.
Travel document               A passport or other official document of identity issued by a State or or-
                              ganization, which may be used by the rightful holder for international
                              travel.
TSF                           TOE security functionality.
User                          Entity (human user or external IT entity) outside the TOE that interacts
                              with the TOE.
User Message                  Data determined by the signatory as the correct input for signing.
VAD                           See Verification authentication data.
Verification authentica-      Data provided as input to a secure signature creation device for authentica-
tion data (VAD)               tion by cognition or by data derived from a user’s biometric characteristics.
X.509                         Standard for certificates, CRLs and authentication services. It is part of the
                              X.500 standard of the ITU-T for realization of a worldwide distributed direc-
                              tory service realized with open system.
