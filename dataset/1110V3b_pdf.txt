Public Security Target
Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)


The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is the Infineon Security Controller with following optional available software
packages:
    The asymmetric cryptographic libraries (ACL) in following alternative versions:
       v2.08.007, v2.07.003 and v2.06.003.
            o All ACL libraries provide RSA1 2048/4096 cryptography.
                The library supports also smaller key lengths, but the certification follows the national regulation
                by the BSI2.
            o All ACL libraries provide elliptic curve cryptography EC3
    the Toolbox library in the versions v2.08.007, v2.07.003 and v2.06.003 provides basic mathematical
       functions for a simplified user interface to the Crypto@2304T. The Toolbox library is not part of the TOE
       Security Functionality (TSF).
    the symmetric cryptographic libraries (SCL) in the improved and enhanced version v2.04.002 and the
       version v2.02.010 provide simplified interfaces and utilize the full services of the SCP to the user
    the hardware support library (HSL) in the versions 01.22.4346 and 02.01.6634 provides a simplified
       interface and utilizes the full services of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM to the user
    the hardware support library (HSL) in the versions 03.11.8339 and 03.12.8812 provide equal to the above
       a simplified interface, utilizes the full services of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM to the user, and enables the
       use of an additional advanced reading respectively writing method
    the CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CIPURSE™ CL and CCL) in the version v02.00.0004 provides the
       user OSPT alliance CIPURSE™ V2 conformant communication functionality between a PICC and a PCD
    the NRG Software. The NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
and with further specific IC dedicated firmware in several alternative versions.

Please note that always the highest version number points to the most recent status of a library coming usually
with improvements and/or additional functionality.

Note that each of the versions of the ACL, SCL, HSL, CCL and the NRG are optional and alternatively. This means
that the TOE comes either with one of the alternative library types– depending on the user choice - or with none.
The library types can freely be combined but not two versions of the equal type. For examples ACL with SCL with
HSL with NRG is welcome but a combination of HSL in version 03.11.8339 and at the same time with HSL in
version 01.22.4346 would not work. The library types are entirely independent from each other.
The security relevant differences in the versions - if any - are detailed in chapter 8. The claims of this Security
Target take the corresponding versions into account and thus the wording in the following refers to the library
type which is cited or else the claim includes always all named versions.

The design step of this TOE is H13.

The Security Target is based on the Protection Profile PP-0084 Security IC Platform Protection Profile with
Augmentation Packages [9] as publicly available for download at https://www.bsi.bund.de and certified under
BSI-CC-PP-0084-2014.
The Security Target is built in compliance with Common Criteria v3.1 Revision 5.

The Security Target takes into account all relevant current final interpretations.

 Rivest-Shamir-Adleman asymmetric cryptographic algorithm

 BSI – Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik – Federal Office for Information Security: Following the national BSI
    recommendations, RSA key lengths below 1976 bits are not included in the certificate. Please note that the BSI expects this key length
    as appropriate until 2022 and recommends for longer usage times key lengths of 3000 bits or higher.
3 The Elliptic Curve Cryptography is abbreviated with EC only in the further, in order to avoid conflicts with the abbreviation for the Error
    Correction Code ECC.

User Guidance Documentation Set
Chapter describes briefly the contents of the individual documents of the User Guidance Documentation,
while the individual documents are versioned and entitled in chapter 9 literature and references. The in this
chapter listed set of user guidance documents belongs to the TOE.

This TOE is represented by a number of various products which are all based on the equal design sources. The
TOE hardware remains entirely equal throughout all derivatives, but the usage for example in form of available
memory sizes, availability of the various interfaces, or other functions varies by means of blocking and chip
configuration. The firmware identifier on board depends on the order.
All TOE derivatives are derived from the equal hardware design results.

The TOE can be identified with the Generic Chip Identification Mode (GCIM). The IFX_CCI_000003h with options
hardware platform is identified by defined bytes of the GCIM as detailed in the HRM [1].
The unique hexadecimal values as stated in the title are:
                         IFX_CCI_000003h
                             IFX_CCI_000005h
                             IFX_CCI_000008h
                             IFX_CCI_00000Ch
                             IFX_CCI_000013h
                             IFX_CCI_000014h
                             IFX_CCI_000015h
                             IFX_CCI_00001Ch
                             IFX_CCI_00001Dh
                             IFX_CCI_000021h
                          IFX_CCI_000022h
The user can easily identify from which production line a certain IC is coming. The corresponding identifier is
given in chapter 2.2.6

These bytes clearly identify the hardware platform, or, in other words, the therein possible values for
IFX_CCI_000003h with options (without prefix IFX_CCI_) represent the equal hardware platform of this TOE. This
means that the hardware entirely equals throughout all derivatives and that the differences are achieved by
configuration and blocking means only. These values are unique for this hardware platform. This means that
these values will not be used in any other platform or product.
The interpretation of the output GCIM data is clearly explained in the user guidance, Hardware Reference Manual
HRM [1].
Although the TOE is represented by a number of various products, all based on the equal design sources, the
hardware is constituted out of few slightly different mask sets enabling to adapt to various external contactless
and contact based devices not being part of this TOE. Except this external adapt capability the TOE hardware

and firmware – depending on the order option – remains entirely equal throughout all derivatives, but the usage
for example in form of available memory sizes, availability of the various interfaces, or other functions varies by
means of blocking and chip configuration. This blocking is applied by Infineon settings during the production
only. Again, all TOE derivatives are derived from the equal hardware design results, the IFX_CCI_000003h with
options.
The differences between the derivatives are achieved by blocking only and have no impact on the TOEs security
policies and related functions. Details are explained in the user guidance hardware reference manual HRM [1].
All product derivatives are identically from module design, layout and footprint, but are made different in their
possibilities to connect to different types of external antennas or to a contact based interface only. Therefore,
the TOE is represented and made out of different mask sets with following TOE internal and security irrelevant
differences:
The differences between the mask sets implement different input capacitances in the analogue part of the radio
frequency interface (RFI). This differentiation in the input capacitances enable for the connection of a wider
range of various antenna types. Note that external antennas or interfaces are not part of the TOE.
To each of the mask sets, an individual value is assigned, which is part of the data output of the Generic Chip
Identification Mode (GCIM). This number is located in the GCIM part individual length byte to clearly
differentiate between the mask sets related to the different input capacitances. Details are explained in the user
guidance hardware reference manual (HRM) and in the errata sheet.
There are no other differences between the mask sets the TOE is produced with.
The IFX_CCI_000003h with options products enable for a maximum of configuration possibilities defined by the
customer order following the market needs. For example, a TOE product can come in one project with the fully
available SOLID FLASH™ NVM1 or in another project with any other SOLID FLASH™ NVM –size below the
physical implementation size, or with a different RAM size. And more, the user has the free choice, whether he
needs the symmetric co-processor SCP, or the asymmetric co-processor Crypto2304T, or both, or none of them.
In addition, the user decides, whether the TOE comes with a free combination of software libraries or without
any. And, to be even more flexible, various interface options can be chosen as well.

To sum up the major selections, the user defines by his order:
      the firmware identifier in several alternatives
      the available memory sizes of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM and RAM
      the availability of the cryptographic coprocessors SCP and Crypto@2304T
      the availability and free combinations of the cryptographic libraries
         ACL-1, ACL-2, ACL-3, SCL-1 and SCL-2
      the availability of the CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library
      the availability of the Flash Loader
      the availability of the alternative libraries HSL-1 or HSL-2 or HSL-3 or HSL-4
      the availability of the library NRG
      the availability of various interface options
      the possibility to tailor the product by blocking on his own premises (BPU)
      the possibility to apply the PIN letter in combination with the Flash Loader
The degree of freedom of the chip configuration is predefined by Infineon Technologies AG and made available
via the order tool.

Beside fix TOE configurations, which can be ordered as usual, this TOE implements optionally the so called
Billing-Per-Use (BPU) ability. This solution enables our customer to tailor the product on his own to the required

configuration – project by project. By that BPU allows for significant reduction of logistic cost at all participating
parties and serves for acceleration of delivery of tailored product to the end-user.
BPU enables our customers to block the chip on demand into the final configuration at his own premises, without
further delivery or involving support by Infineon Technology.
The realization of it requires the presence of the Flash Loader software, enhanced with the BPU blocking
software part. The presence of the BPU ability defines the customer with his order.
The user then receives this TOE in a predefined starting configuration, for example entirely unblocked. Again,
the delivered starting configuration depends on the user order. After delivery, the user can put the TOE in
volume on his stock and can block it down to the required sizes and features, whenever a certain configuration is
required by a certain project.
Depending on the number of TOE products delivered, and their individual final blocked configuration, the
customer receives a balancing payment. By that our customers are charged only for the true configurations
required in their projects.
As written above, the software realizing the user allowed blocking, is implemented and delivered in the TOE –
depending on the order - and is part of the evaluation and certificate. This software is an additional part of the
Flash Loader software but also the other firmware – in all alternative versions - has seen a small enhancement to
enable for BPU.
If BPU is available, the blocking is done by the user at user premises, usually by taking an enhancement of the
user own personalization flow and applying the according APDUs. These APDUs are predefined by Infineon
Technologies and can also depend on the customer order. Only these APDUs can block the chip according to the
user demands.
Infineon Technologies AG provides special software, running in parallel when doing the blocking. This software
summarizes all devices and final configurations allowing for the later commercial balancing. The balancing
depends on the number of chips and their individual final blockings the user has made over a defined time span.
This special software can be used only for the commercial balancing, is not present on the TOE, not security
relevant and therefore not part of this certificate.
All blockings are done by setting the according value in the chip configuration page, where certain parts are left
available to the blocking software. Strong means of authentication are in place. The blocking software
respectively BPU software is an additional part of the Flash Loader software and the only piece of software, able
to manage the blocking APDUs. Therefore, the presence of the Flash Loader software is essential for the BPU
ability.
The user can only apply a predefined and checksum protected set of allowed APDU configuration commands
provided by Infineon Technologies AG. For this, the Flash Loader BPU software part, together with the firmware
– regardless of the version used -, executes one of those APDUs. After the final blocking is done and the user
additionally may have downloaded his software, the entire Flash Loader including the BPU software part is
permanently deactivated. This is called locking of the Flash Loader.
Of course, exclusively all security relevant settings are contained in the IFX-only part. The Flash Loader BPU
software does not access and has no access to the IFX-only part.
Once the user blocking by applying the APDU has been finalized, the configuration page is no more accessible
for changes. After the locking of the Flash Loader, the product is permanently fixed regarding its configurations
and software. A reactivation of the Flash Loader is not possible. At the next start-up, the Boot-Up-Software
(BOS) applies the made settings, and, if called, a Resource Management System (RMS)-function can output the
finally made chip configuration for verification and information purposes.
The entire configuration storage area is protected against manipulation, perturbation and false access. Note that
the IFX-only part of the configuration page is already access protected prior delivery to the user and the TOE
leaves the Infineon Technology premises only locked into User Mode.
The BPU software part is only active on the products which have been ordered with the BPU option. In all other
cases this software is disabled on the product. If a product is ordered without Flash Loader, also the Flash Loader
software is disabled and the BPU configuration changes are blocked in the IFX-configuration, which renders BPU
functionality unusable. Therefore, the BPU feature is only possible if the Flash Loader is active.

If the user decides to use the Flash Loader, regardless whether it is ordered with or without BPU, an additional
process option can be ordered which results in an additional status of the Flash Loader. This process is called PIN-
Letter and enables for simplified logistics and thereby for faster delivery of the ordered TOE products to the user.
The PIN-Letter feature enabling for the PIN-Letter process is an implemented part of the Flash Loader. The
resulting logistical acceleration is possible since the PIN-Letter enables for delivery of not user-specific
configured, not flashed and not personalized TOE products to the user warehouse.
Extra authentication means applied in the PIN-Letter status of the Flash Loader preserve that only the intended
user with the intended PIN-Letter can configure with user specific information and enable the normal Flash
Loader functions in a second step. By that the user orders the products and receives - in a protected way - the
belonging PIN-Letter. PIN-Letter and delivered chips must match.
By delivery the user warehouse gets filled and depending on market demands the user can immediate apply the
authentication means of the PIN-letter. If passing, the TOE products become user specific configured and the
Flash Loader can be used for this specific user in a second step.
The following table outlines the different ways how the user can input his software on this TOE – a TOE without
user available ROM. User software comprises usually the operating system and applications, which are for
Infineon Technologies simply a user data package which is handled as a fixed data package during production.
This provides high process flexibility for the user of which an overview is given in the following table:

For the cases with active Flash Loader on board and whenever the user has finalized his SW-download,
respectively the TOE is in the final state and about to be delivered to the end-user, the user is obligated to lock
the Flash Loader. This locking is the final step and results in a permanent deactivation of the Flash Loader. This
means that once being in the locked status, the Flash Loader cannot be reactivated anymore.
Note that whenever a TOE comes without active Flash Loader, BPU and PIN-Letter process are not possible.
All in all various delivery combinations are given and for example, a product can come with a fix configuration
and with Flash Loader, to enable the user to download software, but without BPU option and with PIN-Letter.
The following cases can occur:

Note that this TOE has no user available ROM. The user software and data are entirely located in a dedicated and
protected part of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The long life storage endurance together with the means for error
detection and correction serves for excellent reliability and endurance.
In addition to the above listed flexible ranges, the user guidance contains a number of predefined configurations
for those customers not making use of the BPU option. All of these configurations belong to the TOE as well and
are of course made of the equal hardware and are inside the above declared ranges.
Today’s predefined configurations of the TOE are listed in the hardware reference manual HRM [1] and is
completed with the list of identification data of the derivatives. These predefined products come with the most
requested configurations and enables to produce volumes on stock in order to simplify logistic processes.
According to the BPU option, a non-limited number of configurations of the TOE may occur in the field. The
number of various configurations depends on the user and order contract only.
This TOE provides dedicated identification means and outputs the platform identifier, the design step and
further configuration information. The hardware reference manual HRM [1] is part of the user guidance and
enables for the clear interpretation of the read out identification data. More information is given in the
confidential Security Target [8].
These output data enable the user for clear identification of the TOE and also of one of the different mask sets
and therewith for examination of the validity of the certificate.
In addition, a dedicated RMS function allows reading out the present configuration in detail. The output RMS
data together with the hardware reference manual HRM [1] enables for clear identification of a product and its
configuration. All these steps for gathering identification and detailed configuration information can be done by
the user without involving the vendor, Infineon Technologies AG.

The TOE consists of the hardware part, the firmware parts in the alternative versions and the optional software
parts. The Smartcard Embedded Software, i.e. the operating system and applications are not part of the TOE.

The firmware comes with several alternative versions and consists of:
    the Boot Software (BOS) firmware conducting configuration and testing task (see chapter 2.2.2) at start-
        up of the TOE
    the Resource Management System (RMS) library providing essential basis functions for the management
        of the RAM, the branch table, the Memory Management Unit (MMU) and other resources
    the optional Flash Loader enabling for the download of user software to the SOLID FLASH™ NVM and
        required for the optional Bill per Use (BPU) feature and the PIN-letter feature
    the Radio Frequency Application Interface (RFAPI) supporting functions located in the ROM.
        The RFAPI functions are not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF)
    the NRG ROM part implementing some basic routines and used by the NRG if ordered.
        The NRG ROM part is not part of the TSF functionality.

The firmware parts BOS, RFAPI and NRG are implemented in a separated Test-ROM also being part of the TOE
but not available for the user. Completing firmware components are located in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM.

The optional software parts are differentiated into following libraries:
    The asymmetric cryptographic libraries (ACL) in following alternative versions:
       v2.08.007, v2.07.003 and v2.06.003.
           o All ACL libraries provide RSA1 2048/4096 cryptography.
                The library supports also smaller key lengths, but the certification follows the national regulation
                by the BSI1.

        the NRG Software. The NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

The RSA, EC and Toolbox libraries provide certain functionality via an API to the Smartcard Embedded Software.
The private parts of the cryptographic libraries are only used internally and have no user interface. If neither the
RSA- nor the EC library is delivered, also the belonging private parts are not on board. The Toolbox library does
not have private library parts.
Each of the libraries ACL, SCL, HSL and NRG is independent from the other libraries and also independent of the
alternative library version of the equal type. This means for example that the HSL-1 runs alone and does not need
parts of HSL-2.
A combination respectively mix up of the two alternative libraries of equal type has not been considered in the
design and is not allowed: The user can select either one or the other of the same library type or none of it.
If the user considers the optional software libraries, the TOE can be delivered including – in free combinations –
or not including any of the optional libraries.

If the user decides not to use any of the offered asymmetric cryptographic libraries, regardless of the version
chosen, none of the cryptographic libraries is consequently delivered and the accompanying Additional Specific
Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions) Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and/ or EC is/are not provided by the
TOE. Else it depends of the chosen library whether the Additional Specific Security Functionality
(O.Add-Functions) Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and/ or EC is/are supported.

The Toolbox library, regardless of the version chosen, provides the user optionally basic arithmetic and modular
arithmetic operations, in order to support user software development using long integer operations. These basic
arithmetic operations do not provide security functionality, implement no security mechanism, and do not
proved additional specific security functionality – as defined for the cryptographic libraries.
The user developed software using the Toolbox basic operations is not part of the TOE.
The Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

The symmetric cryptographic library SCL – in both versions – offers a high level interface to perform the
cryptographic operations DES, TDES and AES with different key lengths on the symmetric cryptographic
coprocessor (SCP) for this TOE. In addition, the SCL in version v2.04.002 implements computation of a CMAC
using AES and 3DES algorithms.

Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)


The SCL implements already several block cipher modes as declared in this document and covering a wide range
of applications, the SCL offers in addition the flexibility to implement additional block cipher modes defined by
the user.
This library provides a simplified interface to the hardware Symmetric Cryptographic Coprocessor (SCP) and
preserves the security and performance requirements as required by the user.
Note that the definition of the key lengths follows the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100 bit security
level by the BSI. This excludes the single DES operation from the certification.

Beside the inclusion and support of cryptographic libraries this TOE comes with the optional Hardware Support
Library (HSL) in different versions significantly simplifying the management of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM
functionality. The HSL constitutes an application interface (API) accessing the HSL state machine and
abstracting low level properties like special function registers and settings of specific hardware features. In short
the HSL provides a user friendly also use case oriented interface considering endurance, reliability and
performance requirements.
In certain configurations each of the HSL versions provide also functions implementing tearing safe behaviour of
the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. If applied the user has no need to care about cases where the TOE is unintentionally
removed from the power supply or the radio frequency field even during managing the SOLID FLASH™ NVM.
Anyhow, the HSL – regardless of the version – remains as an optional library, as even sudden power off situations
do not lead to exploitable conditions of the TOE. In the worse, the TOE ends operation in case of a faulty
programmed SOLID FLASH™ NVM location.
In addition to the above, the HSL in version 03.12.8812 and 03.11.8339 provide an advanced additional method
called Incremental Write (IWR). This method provides enhanced endurance of the SOLID FLASH NVM even
beyond the erase endurance limits for often written objects. Thus this method serves applications with a demand
for high endurance and fast writing times. On the other hand, the read times using this method are slower than
the other methods provided.

The order option CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CIPURSE™ CL) provides cryptographic functionality to
implement a CIPURSE™ V2 conformant protocol.
This protocol provides a secure mutual authentication of two entities, namely the terminal (denoted as PCD =
Proximity Coupling Device (CIPURSE™-compliant terminal)) and a smart card or a token in other form factors
which is called PICC. PICC stands for Proximity Integrated Circuit Card (CIPURSE™-compliant card).
Beside the mutual authentication, the protocol implements measures to maintain the integrity of the transferred
data and preserves in parallel the confidentiality of the transferred data.
By that the CIPURSE™ CL supports the user to implement systems conformant to the CIPURSE™ open standard
implementing a secured, interoperable and flexible transit fare collection solution, including ISO 7816, ISO/IEC
14443-4 communication and AES-128 bit cryptography for multiple payment types.

The NRG Software is a further order option and implements the routines for a NRG interface. The NRG provides
an operating system handling the emulation of a NRG card together with the RF interface. One part of the NRG
is permanently stored in the ROM and the second part consisting of patch and API is located in the SOLID
FLASH™ NVM. The second part is only present if the NRG is part of the delivery. If the NRG is not part of the
delivery the ROM part is present but not used. The NRG implements tearing safe behaviour in context with the
SOLID FLASH™ NVM management and is therefore independent from the HSL. The NRG is not part of the TOE
Security Functionality (TSF).

Deselecting one of the optional libraries does not include the code implementing functionality, which the user
decided not to use. Not including the code of the deselected functionality has no impact of any other security
policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the situation where the user decides just not to use the functionality.

All optional software libraries are stored respectively can be loaded into the SOLID FLASH™ NVM.
All other Smartcard Embedded Software loaded into the SOLID FLASH™ NVM does not belong to the TOE and
is not subject of the evaluation.

1.2            Target of Evaluation overview
The TOE comprises the Infineon Technologies Dual Interface Security Controller IFX_CCI_000003h with options
with specific IC dedicated software, optional cryptographic- and further services libraries.
The TOE is a member of the Infineon Technologies AG high security controller-family meeting the highest
requirements in terms of performance and security. A summary product description is given in this Security
Target.
This TOE is intended to be used in any application and device requiring the highest level of security, for example
as secure element in various devices with various form factors.
This member of the high security controller family features a security philosophy focusing on data integrity
instead of numerous sensors. By that two main principles combined in close synergy are utilized in the security
concept called the Integrity Guard. These main principles are the comprehensive error detection, including the
double CPU, and the full encrypted data path, leaving no plain data on the chip. These principles proved that
they provide excellent protection against invasive and non-invasive attacks known today.
The intelligent shielding algorithm finishes the upper layers, finally providing the so called intelligent implicit
active shielding I2-shield. This provides physical protection against probing and forcing.
This TOE provides multiple contact based and contactless interface options for various applications and markets.
Due to the interface flexibility the product can be used in almost any application, within any device and almost
any form factor. Due to these multiple communication possibilities, the TOE can be seen as a stand-alone
security device being capable to maintain the various communication interfaces simultaneously. Therefore this
TOE is able to run multiple applications, using multiple interfaces independently at the same time.
Again these multiple communication and application independency capabilities enable the usage to almost
everywhere, where highly secure applications are in use and of course in any other application as well. This TOE
is deemed for governmental, corporate, transport and payment markets, or wherever a secure root of trust is
required. Various types of applications can use this TOE, for example in closed loop logical access controls,
physical access controls, secure internet access control and internet authentication, or as multi-application token
or simply as encrypted storage.
This dual interface controller is able to communicate using either the contact based or the contactless interface.
The implemented dual interface provides a maximum flexibility in using following communication protocols
respectively methods:

Contactless Interfaces Options:
    ISO 14443 Type A and Type B
       These are ISO defined proximity contactless protocols using an external antenna and the TOE
       implemented analogue and digital radio frequency interface.
    Advance Framing Mode (AFM)
       This feature implements a frame format with means of error detection and correction applicable for ISO
       14443 Type A and Type B according to the standard ISO/IEC 14443-4AMX
    ISO/IEC 18092
       This is an ISO defined proximity contactless protocol using an external antenna and the TOE
       implemented analogue and digital radio frequency interface.
    NRG Interface
       This is implemented by the options NRG providing a proprietary proximity contactless protocol using an
       external antenna and the TOE implemented analogue and digital radio frequency interface, as well as
       the memory part reserved for NRG use. This interface comprises also the ability to implement the
       Advanced Mode for NRG SAM communication.
    And further advanced high-speed communication modes. More information is given in the confidential
       Security Target [8].

      ISO 7816
       This is the ISO defined standard contact based communication protocol, using the UART and the pads.
      Analogue Contactless Bridge mode (ACLB)
       The ACLB mode provides the possibility to leave the analogue communication to the external device.
       More information is given in the confidential Security Target [8].
      Inter Integrated Circuit Interface (I2C)
       The Inter-Integrated Circuit (IIC) module is able to be connected to an external multi-master-serial-bus-
       system. The IIC protocol software is not part of the TOE. More information is given in the confidential
       Security Target [8].
      General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO)
       The GPIO module supports a number of general purpose I/O signals in parallel and independent of each
       other. Each of the I/O signals can be configured. More information is given in the confidential Security
       Target [8].

Further interface operational modes in contact based and contactless communication are available and outlined
in the confidential Security Target [8].

The TOE provides a real 16-bit CPU-architecture and is compatible to the MCS®251 instruction set with an
execution time faster than a standard MCS®251 microcontroller at the same clock frequency. The major
components of the core system are the two CPUs (Central Processing Units), acting as one, the MMU (Memory
Management Unit) and the MED (Memory Encryption/Decryption Unit). The Core implements also the Post
Failure Detection (PFD) covering CPU, Cache and MED. The two CPUs control each other in order to detect faults
and serve by this for data integrity. The TOE implements a full 16 MByte linear addressable memory space for
each privilege level, a simple scalable Memory Management concept and a scalable stack size. The flexible
memory concept consists of a ROM, RAM and the non-volatile memory (NVM), which we call SOLID FLASH™
NVM. The ROM is not available for the user.
The ROM is not available for the user and contains the main parts of firmware components only.

The firmware comes in several alternative versions and is composed out of the:
    Boot-up software (BOS), the Resource Management System (RMS), the Flash Loader (FL), the NRG code
        part located in the ROM and the RFI supporting functions. The BOS applies the essential configuration,
        internal testing and the start-up.
        The NRG ROM part and the RFI supporting functions are not part of the TOE Security Functionality
        (TSF).
    The RMS implements a low level application interface (API) to the Smartcard Embedded Software and
        provides handling and managing routines for RAM, MMU, Branch table, configuration and further
        functions.
    The Flash Loader allows downloading user software to the SOLID FLASH™ NVM during the
        manufacturing process and also at user premises – if ordered.
    The Radio Frequency Interface Application Interface (RFAPI) functions consist of executable code in the
        ROM which is part of the TOE and a SOLID FLASH™ NVM code part which is delivered separately to the
        user and which is not part of the TOE. The RFAPI is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
    The NRG software part located in the ROM. These routines are only called if the NRG library is executed;
        else these routines are not used. The NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

With regard to the RFAPI part, this means that the TOE products are delivered without the code part located in
the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. This RFAPI part is a piece of software delivered separated from the chip in order to be
implemented by the user together with his software. Only the RFAPI SOLID FLASH™ NVM code part can call the
RFAPI ROM functions and optimize the contactless communication. Therefore, the RFAPI ROM functions do not
implement a user interface. In general the RFAPI implements a fast TOE startup and simplifies the user settings

for optimized contactless communication. The ROM and SOLID FLASH™ NVM areas storing the RFAPI functions
are access protected and only the SOLID FLASH™ NVM part, which is not part of the TOE, implements the user
interface. The RFAPI is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

This TOE implements a Hybrid Random Number Generator (HRNG). This HRNG equals to the expression Hybrid
Physical True Random Number Generator (hybrid PTRNG) as defined by the BSI. In the following, the BSI
expression hybrid PTRNG is used. The hybrid PTRNG implements a true physical random source and has
evidenced its conformance to the classes of AIS31 [13] as declared in chapter 7.1.1.1.
The produced genuine random numbers are available as a security service for the user and are also used for
internal purposes. Together with the guidelines in [6] the hybrid PTRNG operates in the following modes of
operation and is conformant to the named classes:
     True Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.2
     Hybrid Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.3
     Deterministic Random Number Generation (DRNG) AIS31 DRG.3
     Key Stream Generation (KSG), stream cipher generation AIS31 DRG.2
The hybrid PTRNG is deemed for any application requiring excellent physical random data entropy.

The two cryptographic coprocessors serve the need of modern cryptography:
    The symmetric co-processor (SCP) combines both AES and DES with one, two or triple-key hardware
       acceleration. Please note that the single DES algorithm is not in the scope of evaluation due to national
       regulation by BSI.
    And, the Asymmetric Crypto Co-processor, called Crypto@2304T, provides optimized high performance
       calculations for the user software executing cryptographic operations and is also used by the optional
       cryptographic libraries for Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and Elliptic Curve (EC) cryptography.

The optional software parts are differentiated into following libraries:
    The asymmetric cryptographic libraries (ACL) in following alternative versions:
       v2.08.007, v2.07.003 and v2.06.003.
           o All ACL libraries provide RSA1 2048/4096 cryptography.
                The library supports also smaller key lengths, but the certification follows the national regulation

       Security Functionality (TSF).
    the symmetric cryptographic libraries (SCL) in the improved and enhanced version v2.04.002 and the

     provides a high level interface to the hardware component Crypto2304T and includes countermeasures
        against fault injection and side channel attacks.
     implements the generation of RSA Key Pairs (RsaKeyGen), the RSA signature verification (RsaVerify),
        the RSA signature generation (RsaSign) and the RSA modulus recalculation (RsaModulus). This RSA
        library can perform RSA operations from 512 to 4096 bits.
     implements the high level interface to hardware cryptographic coprocessor Crypto2304T which runs the
        basic long number calculations (add, subtract, multiply, square) with high performance.
The RSA library is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software.
Following the national BSI recommendations, RSA key lengths below 1976 bits are not included in the certificate.
Please note that the BSI expects this key length as appropriate until 2022 and recommends for longer usage
times key lengths of 3000 bits or higher.

The EC library, regardless of the version chosen:
     provides a high level interface to Elliptic Curve Cryptography computed on the hardware component
        Crypto2304T and includes countermeasures against fault injection and side channel attacks.
     implements routines for ECDSA signature generation, for ECDSA signature verification, ECDSA key
        generation and for the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement.
     In addition, the EC library provides an additional function for calculating primitive elliptic curve
        operations like ECC Add and ECC Double.
     EC curves over prime field Fp, as well as over GF(2n) finite field are supported too.
The EC library is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software.
The security functional requirement covers the standard Brainpool [19] and NIST [26] Elliptic Curves with key
lengths of 160, 163, 192, 224, 233, 256, 283, 320, 384, 409, 512 or 521 bits.
The definition of the key lengths follows the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100 bit security level by the
BSI.
Numerous other curve types, being also secure in terms of side channel attacks on this TOE, exist, which the user
optionally can add in the composition certification process.

If the user decides not to use any of the offered cryptographic library(s), regardless of the version, none of the
cryptographic libraries is consequently delivered and the accompanying Additional Specific Security
Functionality (O.Add-Functions) Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and/ or EC is/are not provided by the TOE. Else it
depends of the chosen library whether the Additional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions) Rivest-
Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and/ or EC is/are supported.

The Toolbox library, regardless of the version chosen, does not provide cryptographic support or additional
security functionality as it provides only the following basic long integer arithmetic and modular functions in
software, supported by the cryptographic coprocessor: Addition, subtraction, division, multiplication,
comparison, reduction, modular addition, modular subtraction, modular multiplication, modular inversion and
modular exponentiation. No security relevant policy, mechanism or function is supported. The Toolbox library is
deemed for software developers as support for simplified implementation of long integer and modular
arithmetic operations. The Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

The symmetric cryptographic library SCL offers a high level interface to perform the cryptographic operations
DES, TDES and AES with different key lengths on the symmetric cryptographic coprocessor (SCP) for this TOE.

Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)


In addition, the SCL implements MAC computation of a CMAC, using AES and 3DES algorithms, respectively a
RetailMAC using the DES algorithm.
The SCL implements already several block cipher modes as declared in this document and covers a wide range of
applications, but the SCL offers in addition the flexibility to implement additional user defined block cipher
modes.
Both library versions provide a simplified interface to the hardware Symmetric Cryptographic Coprocessor (SCP)
and preserve the security and performance requirements as required by the user.
Even in the basic configuration the SCL meets the targeted security level, which can be further increased by
simple means of configuration options.
The key lengths used for the AES and DES functionality follow the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100
bit security level issued by the BSI1. This regulation excludes the single DES operation from the certification as it
is considered to be not sufficiently secure from algorithm perspective.
For both versions, the certification covers the SCL cryptographic functionality of the AES algorithm with key
lengths of 128, 192, 256 bits and the TDEA or TripleDES (TDES) algorithm with an effective key size of 112 and
168 bits. For the version v2.04.002 the certification covers the CMAC functionality too.

Note that this TOE can come with both cryptographic co-processors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a
blocked Crypto2304T, or with both cryptographic co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the user’s
choice. No accessibility of the deselected cryptographic co-processors is without impact on any other security
policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the situation where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic
co-processors.

Beside the inclusion and support of cryptographic libraries this TOE comes with the optional Hardware Support
Library (HSL) in different alternative versions, significantly simplifying the management of the SOLID FLASH™
NVM functionality. The HSL constitutes an application interface (API) accessing the HSL state machine and
abstracting low level properties like special function registers and settings of specific hardware features. In short
the HSL provides a user friendly also use case oriented interface considering endurance, reliability and
performance. In certain configurations the HSL provides also functions implementing tearing safe behaviour of
the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. If used the user has no need to care about cases where the TOE is suddenly cut off the
power supply even during managing the SOLID FLASH™ NVM.
Anyhow, the HSL remains as an optional library as even sudden power off situations does never lead to
exploitable conditions of the TOE. In the worse the TOE ends operation in case of a faulty programmed SOLID
FLASH™ NVM location due to the Integrity Guard.
In addition to the above, the HSL in version 03.12.8812 and 03.11.8339 provide an advanced additional method
called Incremental Write (IWR). This method provides enhanced endurance of the SOLID FLASH NVM even
beyond the erase endurance limits for often written objects. Thus this method serves applications with a demand
for high endurance and fast writing times. On the other hand, the read times using this method are slower than
the other methods provided.

The order option CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CIPURSE™ CL) provides cryptographic functionality to
implement a CIPURSE™ V2 conformant protocol.
This protocol provides a secure mutual authentication of two entities, namely the terminal (denoted as PCD =
Proximity Coupling Device (CIPURSE™-compliant terminal)) and a smart card or a token in other form factors
which is called PICC. PICC stands for Proximity Integrated Circuit Card (CIPURSE™-compliant card).
Beside the mutual authentication, the protocol implements measures to maintain the integrity of the transferred
data and preserves in parallel the confidentiality of the transferred data.
By that the CIPURSE™ CL supports the user to implement systems conformant to the CIPURSE™ open standard
implementing a secured, interoperable and flexible transit fare collection solution, including ISO 7816, ISO/IEC
14443-4 communication and AES-128 bit cryptography for multiple payment types.

Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT)


By that the CIPURSE™ CL supports the user to implement systems conformant to the CIPURSE™ open standard
implementing a secured, interoperable and flexible transit fare collection solution, including ISO 7816, ISO/IEC
14443-4 communication and AES-128 bit cryptography for multiple payment types.
The order option of the CIPURSE™ CL is conformant to the CIPURSE™ open standard [18] for both, the PICC and
then PCD software parts. It implements the by the OSPT alliance standardized application interface for the card
and the terminal side.
The scope of this certification of this TOE covers all parts of the CIPURSE™ CL which are later implemented by
the user on the user card respectively token based on this TOE and the functionality of the PCD software part
which is implemented in the terminal side. The PCD software operates also on the hardware of this TOE which is
implemented in the terminal.
The CIPURSE™ CL implements the by the OSPT alliance standardized application interface for the card and the
terminal side.

The NRG Software is a further order option and implements the routines for a NRG interface. The NRG
implements an operating system handling the emulation of an NRG card together with the RF interface. One
part of the NRG is permanently stored in the ROM and the second part consisting of patch and API is located in
the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The second part is only present if the NRG is part of the delivery. If the NRG is not part
of the delivery the ROM part is present but not used. The NRG implements tearing safe behaviour in context with
the SOLID FLASH™ NVM management and is therefore independent from the HSL. The NRG is not part of the
TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

To fulfill the highest security requirements for smartcards today and also in the future, this TOE implements a
progressive digital security concept, which already has been certified in various forerunner processes. This TOE
utilizes digital security features to include customer friendly security, combined with a robust design overcoming
the disadvantages on analogue protection technologies. The TOE provides full on-chip encryption covering the
complete core, busses, memories and cryptographic co-processors leaving no plain data on the chip. A further
security feature has been implemented for this TOE protecting also the involved addresses transferred over the
memory bus. Therefore the attractiveness for attackers is a step further extremely reduced as encrypted signals
are of no use for the attacker – neither for manipulation nor for eavesdropping.
In addition, the TOE is equipped with a comprehensive error detection capability for the complete data path. The
dual CPU approach allows error detection even while processing. A comparator detects whether a calculation
was performed without errors. This approach does not leave any parts of the core circuitry unprotected. The
concept allows that the relevant attack scenarios are detected, whereas other conditions that would not lead to
an error would mainly be ignored. That renders the TOE robust against environmental influences.
Furthermore, the TOE implements what we call intelligent implicit shielding (I2). These measures constitute a
shield on sensitive and security critical signals which is not recognizable or obvious as a shield. This provides
excellent protection against invasive physical attacks, such as probing, forcing or similar.
In this Security Target the TOE is briefly described and a summary specification is given. The security
environment of the TOE during its different phases of the lifecycle is defined. The assets are identified which
have to be protected through the security policy. The threats against these assets are described. The security
objectives and the security policy are defined, as well as the security requirements. These security requirements
are built out of the security functional requirements as part of the security policy and the security assurance
requirements. These are the formal steps applied during the evaluation and certification showing that the TOE
meets the targeted requirements. In addition, simplified functionality of the TOE matching the requirements is
described.

The assets, threats, security objectives and the security functional requirements are defined in this Security
Target and in the Security IC Platform Protection Profile [9] and are referenced here. These requirements build
up a minimal standard common for all Security ICs.
The security functions are defined here in the security target as property of this specific TOE. Here it is shown
how this specific TOE fulfills the requirements for the common standard defined in the Common Criteria
documents [10], [11], [12] and in the Security IC Platform Protection Profile [9].

The TOE description helps to understand the specific security environment and the security policy. In this
context the assets, threats, security objectives and security functional requirements can be employed. The
following is a more detailed description of the TOE than in the Security IC Platform Protection Profile [9] as it

factor for particularly applications requiring highest levels of security and for its previous use as developing
platform for smart card operating systems according to the lifecycle model from [9].
The term Smartcard Embedded Software is used in the following for all operating systems and applications

Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Target of Evaluation Description


Introduction
The main components of the core system are the dual CPU (Central Processing Units), the MMU (Memory
Management Unit) and the MED (Memory Encryption/Decryption Unit). The coprocessor block contains the
cryptographic processors for RSA/EC and DES/AES processing, while the peripheral block contains the random
number generation, the module for the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), the timers and watchdogs and last but
not least the external interfaces service.
All data of the memory block is encrypted and all memory types are equipped with an error detection code
(EDC), the SOLID FLASH™ NVM in addition with an error correction code (ECC). All data and addresses
transferred over the two bus systems are encrypted respectively masked.
This dual interface controller is able to communicate using either the contact based or the contactless interface.
The implemented dual interface provides a maximum flexibility in using following communication protocols
respectively methods. More information is given in the confidential hardware reference manual HRM [1].

The Core
The dual CPU, constituted out of two CPUs and acting as one from users view, is based on a 16-bit architecture
based on the MCS® 251 instruction set with an execution time faster than a standard MCS® 251 at the same
clock frequency. The instruction set for the architecture is also largely compatible with the well-known 80251
microcontroller family. Anyhow, the CPU has a special internal architecture and timing that differs from the
standard 80251 and it provides additional powerful instructions, meeting the requirements for new operating
system generations. Despite its compatibility the CPU implementation is entirely proprietary and not standard.
The CPU accesses the memory via the integrated Memory Encryption and Decryption unit (MED). The Post
Failure Detection (PFD) covers the modules CPU, Cache and MED, automatically manages the error detection of
the individual memories and detects incorrect transfer of data between the memories by means of error code
comparison. The access rights of the application to the memories can be controlled with the memory
management unit (MMU). Errors in the memories are automatically detected (EDC) and in terms of the SOLID
FLASH™ NVM 1-Bit-errors are also corrected (ECC). The two processors of the CPU control each other in order
to detect faults and maintain by this the data integrity. A comparator detects whether a calculation was
performed without errors and allows error detection even while processing. Therefore the TOE is equipped with
a full error detection capability for the complete data path, which does not leave any parts of the circuitry
unprotected.
The Cache memory – or simply, the Cache – is a high-speed memory-buffer located between the CPU and the
(external) main memories holding a copy of some of the memory contents to enable access to the copy, which is
considerably faster than retrieving the information from the main memory. In addition to its fast access speed,
the Cache also consumes less power than the main memories. All Cache systems own their usefulness to the
principle of locality, meaning that programs are inclined to utilize a particular section of the address space for
their processing over a short period of time. By including most or all of such a specific area in the Cache, system
performance can be dramatically enhanced. The implemented post failure detection identifies and manages
errors if appeared during storage.

The Busses
The bus system comprises two separate bus entities: a memory bus and peripheral bus for high-speed
communication internally between the modules and to the outer world with the peripherals. All transfer of data
and addresses via the memory and the peripheral bus systems is protected by means of encryption respectively
masking leaving no plain contents anywhere on the chip.

The cryptographic Coprocessors
The TOE implements two cryptographic co-processors: The symmetric cryptographic co-processor (SCP)
combines both AES and DES with one, two or triple-key hardware acceleration. The Asymmetric Crypto Co-
processor, called Crypto2304T, provides optimized high performance calculations for the user software
executing cryptographic operations and is also used by the optional cryptographic libraries for RSA and Elliptic
Curve (EC) cryptography. These co-processors are especially designed for smart card applications with respect to

CC Document                                             22                                                       1.8

the security and power consumption. The SCP module computes the complete DES algorithm within a few clock
cycles and is especially designed to counter attacks like DPA, EMA and DFA.
Note that this TOE can come with both crypto co-processors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked
Crypto2304T, or with both crypto co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior
to the production of the hardware. No accessibility of the deselected cryptographic co-processors is without
impact on any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the situation where the user decides
just not to use the cryptographic co-processors.

The Memories
The BOS (boot-up software), RMS (Resource Management System), basic routines for the NRG software, RFAPI
and the Flash Loader together compose the TOE firmware in the alternative versions stored in the ROM and the
patches hereof in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. All mandatory functions for internal testing, production usage and
start-up behavior (BOS), and also the RMS functions are grouped together in a common privilege level. These
privilege levels are protected by a hardwired Memory Management Unit (MMU) setting.
The controllers of this TOE store both code and data in a linear 16-MByte memory space, allowing direct access
without the need to swap memory segments in and out of memory using a memory management unit.
The user software can be implemented in various options depending on the user’s choice and described in
chapter 1.1. Thereby the user software, or parts of it, can be downloaded into the SOLID FLASH™ NVM, either
during production of the TOE or at customer side. In the latter case, the user downloads his software or the final
parts of it at his own premises, using the Flash Loader software.
All content regardless whether stored or transferred remains encrypted and EDC protected. Also the addresses
are protected by cryptographic protection means.
The TOE uses also Special Function Registers SFR. These SFR registers are used for general purposes and chip
configuration. The start-up register values are stored in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM, in the configuration page
area.

The System Peripherals
The system peripheral block serves for operation within the specified ranges and manages the alarms and self-
testing. Note that there is a small set of sensors left in order to detect excessive deviations from the specified
operational range, while not being over-sensitive. These digital features do not need adjustment or calibration
and are deemed to increase the robustness of the chip against environmental influences even more. Conditions
that would not be harmful for the operation would therefore in most cases not disturb the proper function.
By implementing the integrity guard concept, the sensors are no more required for the TOE security. The sensors
are therefore assigned to be security supporting but do not implement a security mechanism on their own. The
only sensor contributing to a security mechanism is the frequency sensor.
After the BOS has finished, the operating system or application can call the User Mode Security Life Control
(UMSLC) test. The UMSLC tests several modules, various functions and sensors for correct operation. Some of
them have a user configurable interface.

The Control
The Interface Management Module (IMM) handles all interfaces in a unified manner and simplifies by this the
variety of interfaces for the user. It provides simultaneous maintenance of a multitude of various interfaces in a
non-conflicting manner simultaneously if so configured. The Interrupt and Peripheral Event Channel Controller
(ITP) manages individual interrupt requests signaled as events by peripherals. The controller can be associated
with different interrupt events enabling to select between executing a standard interrupt service routine or a fast
data transfer between memory locations over a so-called peripheral event channel (PEC). The control-block
implements a summary of all control interfaces respectively SFRs used by various modules.

The Peripherals
This block implements the various interface options, communication protocols and operation modes as outlined

Target of Evaluation Description


In addition to the interfaces it implements the Hybrid Random Number Generator (HRNG). This HRNG equals to
the expression Hybrid Physical True Random Number Generator (hybrid PTRNG) as defined by the BSI. In the
following, the BSI expression hybrid PTRNG is used. The hybrid PTRNG implements a true physical random
source and has evidenced its conformance to the classes of AIS31 [13] as declared in chapter 7.1.1.1.
The produced genuine random numbers are available as a security service for the user and are also used for
internal purposes. Together with the guidelines in [6] the hybrid PTRNG operates in the following modes of
operation and is conformant to the named classes:
      True Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.2
      Hybrid Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.3
      Deterministic Random Number Generation (DRNG) AIS31 DRG.3
      Key Stream Generation (KSG), stream cipher generation AIS31 DRG.2
The hybrid PTRNG is deemed for any application requiring excellent physical random data entropy.
Several timer modules are implemented used for example to control the communication via the UART, other
interfaces behavior, for asynchronous wake-up and similar timed events.
The timer permits easy implementation of communication protocols such as T=1 and all other time-critical
operations. The UART-controlled I/O interface allows the security controller and the terminal interface to be
operated independently. The watchdog timers implement a configurable time out for various purposes. More
information can be found in the hardware reference manual HRM [1].
The cyclic redundancy check (CRC) module is used to compute a checksum over any input data and allows by
that explicit checking integrity of a piece of data.

Feature Summary
The following is a list of central features provided by this TOE:
      24-bit linear addressing
      Up to 16 MByte of addressable memory
      Data and addresses protected against eavesdropping
      Register-based architecture
         (registers can be accessed as bytes, words (2 bytes), and double words (4 bytes))
      2-stage instruction pipeline
      Based MCS® 251 instruction set and largely compatible with the well-known 80251 microcontroller
         family
      Extensive additional set of powerful instructions, including 16- and 32-bit arithmetic and logic
         instructions
      Cache with single-cycle access searching
      16-bit self-checking dual CPU
      Hybrid Physical True Random Number Generation for random numbers at highest entropy quality.
The TOE sets a new, improved standard of integrated security features, thereby meeting the requirements of all
smart card and other related applications or form factors, such as information integrity, access control, mobile
telephone and identification, as well as use cases in electronic funds transfer and healthcare systems.
To sum up, the TOE is a powerful dual interface security controller with a large amount of memory and special
peripheral devices with improved performance, optimized power consumption, free to choose contact based or
contactless operation, at minimal chip size while implementing high security. It therefore constitutes the basis
for future smart card and other related applications in unlimited form factors.

2.2            Scope of the TOE
The TOE comprises:
    The silicon die, respectively the Integrated Circuit (IC) respectively the hardware of this TOE, in several
      versions. The versions differ from each other by the interface capabilities: The IC comes with several
      interface capacitances, enabling connections to a variety of external antennas, or to be operated contact
      based only.
    The TOE is also delivered in various configurations, achieved by means of blocking by the customer
      and/or depending on the customer order.
    All configurations and resulting derivatives generated out of the mask sets described as above.
    All according firmware in the alternative versions and
    All optional software in various combinations which can be freely combined as desired and ordered
    All hardware configurations of any individual TOE product

All product derivatives of this TOE, including all configuration possibilities differentiated by the GCIM data and
the configuration information output, are manufactured by Infineon Technologies AG. In the following
descriptions the term “manufacturer” stands short for Infineon Technologies AG, the manufacturer of the TOE.
New configurations can occur at any time depending on the user blocking or by different configurations applied
by the manufacturer. In any case the user is able to clearly identify the TOE hardware, its configuration and proof
the validity of the certificate independently, meaning without involving the manufacturer.
The various blocking options, as well as the means used for the blocking, are done during the manufacturing
process and/or at user premises. This depends on the user order. Entirely all means of blocking and the, for the
blocking involved firmware respectively software parts, used at Infineon and/or the user premises, are subject of
the evaluation. All resulting configurations of a TOE derivative and all possible combinations with optional
software libraries are subject of the certificate. All resulting hardware configurations are either at the predefined
limits or within the predefined configuration ranges.

The firmware used for the TOE internal testing and TOE operation, the firmware and software parts exclusively
used for the blocking, and the parts of the firmware and software required for cryptographic support are part of
the TOE and therefore part of the certification. The documents as described in section 2.2.4 and listed in Table 1,
are supplied as user guidance.

Not part of the TOE and not part of the certification are:
    the Smartcard Embedded Software respectively user software, and
    the piece of software running at user premises and collecting the BPU receipts coming from the TOE.
       This BPU software part is the commercially deemed part of the BPU software, not running on the TOE,
       but allowing refunding the customer, based on the collected user blocking information. The receipt from
       each blocked TOE is collected by this software – chip by chip.

2.2.2          Firmware and software of the TOE
The entire firmware in several alternative versions of the TOE consists of different parts which are outlined in the
following. The following description holds true for all alternative versions with add on for the new version
v80.100.17.3. The former FW identifiers implement no difference on the delivered and board of the IC located
firmware parts, with the exception of the firmware identifier number itself. The new version v80.100.17.3 has
been completed with an additional functionality regarding the GCIM identification data output of the TOE, which
is an order option. For the TOE security, policy and related claims the firmware identifier is regardless. The user
may consider the new version if the GCIM identification data output matters in the application.

The entire firmware of the TOE consists of different parts which are outlined in the following.

One part comprises the Resource Management System (RMS) with routines for managing the Cache, RAM,
MMU, the branch table, configuration and the testing functions. The RMS is the IC Dedicated Support Software
as defined in the PP [9]. The RMS routines are stored from Infineon Technologies AG in a reserved area of the
ROM but parts of it are also stored in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM.
There is no ROM space available for the user.

The second part is the Boot Software (BOS), consisting of initialization and various testing routines and providing
the different operation modes of the TOE. The BOS is the IC Dedicated Test Software as defined in the PP [9].
The BOS routines are stored in the especially protected test ROM but parts of it are also stored in the SOLID
FLASH™ NVM. The BOS is not accessible for the user software.

The third part is the Flash Loader. This piece of software enables the download of the user software or parts of it
to the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The Flash Loader routines are stored in the especially protected test ROM but parts
of it are also stored in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. Depending on the order the Flash Loader comes with the BPU-
software enabling for TOE configuration at user premises. After completion of the download and/or final
configuration of the TOE, and prior delivery to the end user, the user is obligated to lock the Flash Loader.
Locking is the permanent deactivation of the Flash Loader meaning that if once locked it can no more be
reactivated and used. Note that the Flash Loader routines are always present, but are deactivated in case of the
derivatives ordered without the software download option. Thus the user interface is identically in both cases –
with and without Flash Loader on board - and consequently the related interface routines can be called in each of
the derivatives. Already the MMU blocks calls of the Flash Loader software at derivatives coming without Flash
Loader. In derivatives with Flash Loader the related function is performed.

The fourth part is constituted from RFAPI functions in the ROM implementing a fast TOE startup and supporting
the user by simplification of the required RFI settings if the contactless interface is used. The RFAPI functions are
not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

The fifth part is some basic routines for the NRG Software which are also located in the ROM and always on
board, regardless whether the user has ordered the optional NRG library or not. If the NRG library is not on
board, these routines remain unused in the ROM.
The NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

All parts of the firmware above are - depending on the order - combined together by the TOE generation process
to a single file and stored then in the data files, the TOE is produced from. This comprises the firmware files for
the ROM, where only Infineon Technologies AG has access, as well as the data to be flashed in the SOLID
FLASH™ NVM. The alternative firmware versions can be identified by the firmware identifier.

The optional software parts are differentiated into following libraries:
    The asymmetric cryptographic libraries (ACL) in following alternative versions:
       v2.08.007, v2.07.003 and v2.06.003.
           o All ACL libraries provide RSA1 2048/4096 cryptography.
                The library supports also smaller key lengths, but the certification follows the national regulation
                by the BSI2.
           o All ACL libraries provide elliptic curve cryptography EC3
    the Toolbox library in the versions v2.08.007, v2.07.003 and v2.06.003 provides basic mathematical
       functions for a simplified user interface to the Crypto@2304T. The Toolbox library is not part of the TOE
       Security Functionality (TSF).
    the symmetric cryptographic libraries (SCL) in the improved and enhanced version v2.04.002 and the
       version v2.02.010 provide simplified interfaces and utilize the full services of the SCP to the user
    the hardware support library (HSL) in the versions 01.22.4346 and 02.01.6634 provides a simplified

    the hardware support library (HSL) in the versions 03.11.8339 and 03.12.8812 provide equal to the above
       a simplified interface, utilizes the full services of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM to the user, and enables the
       use of an additional advanced reading respectively writing method
    the CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CIPURSE™ CL and CCL) in the version v02.00.0004 provides the
       user OSPT alliance CIPURSE™ V2 conformant communication functionality between a PICC and a PCD
    the NRG Software. The NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

The RSA cryptographic library, regardless of the version chosen:
     provides a high level interface to the hardware component Crypto2304T and includes countermeasures
        against fault injection and side channel attacks.
     implements the generation of RSA Key Pairs (RsaKeyGen), the RSA signature verification (RsaVerify),
        the RSA signature generation (RsaSign) and the RSA modulus recalculation (RsaModulus). This RSA
        library can perform RSA operations from 512 to 4096 bits.
     implements the high level interface to hardware cryptographic coprocessor Crypto2304T which runs the
        basic long number calculations (add, subtract, multiply, square) with high performance.
The RSA library, regardless of the version chosen, is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the
user software.
Depending on the customer’s choice, the TOE can be delivered with the 4096 code portion or with the 2048 code
portion only. The 2048 code portion is included in both. Part of the evaluation are the RSA straight operations
with key length from 512 bits to 2048 bits, and the RSA CRT4 operations with key lengths of 512 Bits to 4096 Bits.
Following the national BSI recommendations, RSA key lengths below 1976 bits are not included in the certificate.
Please note that the BSI expects this key length as appropriate until 2022 and recommends for longer usage
times key lengths of 3000 bits or higher.

The EC library regardless of the version chosen is used to:
    provide a high level interface to Elliptic Curve Cryptography computed on the hardware component
        Crypto2304T and includes countermeasures against fault injection and side channel attacks.

       implement routines for ECDSA signature generation, for ECDSA signature verification, ECDSA key

     implement a high level interface to Elliptic Curve Cryptography computed on the hardware component

     In addition, the EC library provides an additional function for calculating primitive elliptic curve
        operations like ECC Add and ECC Double.
     over prime field Fp, as well as over GF(2n) finite field are supported too.
The EC library is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software.
The security functional requirement covers the standard Brainpool [19] and NIST [26] Elliptic Curves with key
lengths of 160, 163, 192, 224, 233, 256, 283, 320, 384, 409, 512 or 521 bits. For one part the definition of the key
lengths follows the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100 bit security level by the BSI.
Numerous other curve types, being also secure in terms of side channel attacks on this TOE, exist, which the user
optionally can add in the composition certification process.

The Toolbox library, regardless of the version chosen, does not provide cryptographic support or additional
security functionality as it provides only the following basic long integer arithmetic and modular functions in
software, supported by the cryptographic coprocessor: Addition, subtraction, division, multiplication,
comparison, reduction, modular addition, modular subtraction, modular multiplication, modular inversion and
modular exponentiation. No security relevant policy, mechanism or function is supported. The Toolbox library is
deemed for software developers as support for simplified implementation of long integer and modular
arithmetic operations. The Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

The symmetric cryptographic library SCL – in both versions - offers a high level interface to perform the
cryptographic operations DES, TDES and AES with different key lengths on the symmetric cryptographic
coprocessor (SCP) for this TOE. In addition the SCL implements computation of a CMAC using AES and 3DES
algorithms.
The SCL implements already several block cipher modes as declared in this document and covers a wide range of
applications, but the SCL offers in addition the flexibility to implement additional user defined block cipher
modes. The SCL is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software.
Both library versions provide a simplified interface to the hardware Symmetric Cryptographic Coprocessor (SCP)
and preserve the security and performance requirements as required by the user.
Even in the basic configuration the SCL meets the targeted security level, which can be further increased by
means of configuration options.
The key lengths used for the AES and DES functionality follow the national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100
bit security level issued by the BSI1. This regulation excludes the single DES operation from the certification as it
is considered to be not sufficiently secure from algorithm perspective.
For both versions, the certification covers the SCL cryptographic functionality of the AES algorithm with key
lengths of 128, 192, 256 bits and the TDEA or TripleDES (TDES) algorithm with an effective key size of 112 and
168 Bits. For the version v2.04.002 the certification covers the CMAC functionality too.

Beside the inclusion and support of cryptographic libraries this TOE comes with the optional Hardware Support
Library (HSL) in different alternative versions significantly simplifying the management of the SOLID FLASH™
NVM functionality. The HSL (all versions) constitutes an application interface (API) accessing the HSL state
machine and abstracting low level properties like special function registers and settings of specific hardware

features. In short the HSL provides a user friendly also use case oriented interface considering endurance,
reliability and performance.
All HSL library versions are delivered as object code.
The HSL is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software.
All HSL versions implement, beyond the low level driver, the basic method In-place Update leveraging the
dedicated advantages of the new SOLID FLASH™ NVM technology.
In addition to the above, all HSL versions provide an advanced additional method called Incremental Write (IWR).
This method provides enhanced endurance of the SOLID FLASH NVM even beyond the erase endurance limits
for often written objects. Thus this method serves applications with a demand for high endurance and fast
writing times. On the other hand, the read times using this method are slower than the other methods provided.
The HSL versions provide tearing save behavior, whereas we define tearing as an untimed power cut off which
could occur anytime and in the worse therewith could also occur during writing to or erasing of pages in the
SOLID FLASH™ NVM.
If the HSL – all versions are meant - comes with the TOE and the user implements the offered configuration and
dedicated functions tearing save behaviour of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM is provided. In these cases the user does
not need to care about tearing events since either the old data or the new data are correctly in place.
In addition to the versions 01.22.4346 and 02.01.6634, the HSLs in versions 03.11.8339 and 03.12.8812 provide a
furthermore improved method for the Incremental Write (IWR).
But, even in the cases where the user decides not to use the HSL and did also not implement own routines
preserving the consistency of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM, the hardware protection means prevent from operation
of inconsistent data. Therefore, in no cases a tearing event leads to an exploitable situation respectively
vulnerability.
Anyhow, the user should be aware and is recommended to use either the HSL or implement own routines
managing tearing events since if there would occur a faulty programmed SOLID FLASH™ NVM location the TOE
ends operation at that point.

The order option CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CIPURSE™ CL) provides cryptographic functionality to
implement a CIPURSE™ V2 conformant protocol.
This protocol provides a secure mutual authentication of two entities, namely the terminal (denoted as PCD =
Proximity Coupling Device (CIPURSE™-compliant terminal)) and a smart card or a token in other form factors
which is called PICC. PICC stands for Proximity Integrated Circuit Card (CIPURSE™-compliant card).
Beside the mutual authentication, the protocol implements measures to maintain the integrity of the after
passing successfully the authentication transferred data. It depends on the chosen operation mode whether the
user requires integrity protection only, for example if the exchange is used in a secure environment only, or
whether complete protection including the encrypted transfer of user data between the two authentication
entities is an issue. Both operation modes are part of the CIPURSE™ open standard and offered as integrity
protection mode and as confidential communication mode.
By that the CIPURSE™ CL supports the user to implement systems conformant to the CIPURSE™ open standard
implementing a secured, interoperable and flexible transit fare collection solution, including ISO 7816, ISO/IEC
14443-4 communication and AES-128 bit cryptography for multiple payment types.
The CIPURSE™ CL is conformant to the CIPURSE™ open standard [18] for both, the PICC and then PCD software
parts. It implements the by the OSPT alliance standardized application interface for the card and the terminal
side.
The scope of this certification of this TOE covers all parts of the CIPURSE™ CL which are later implemented by
the user on the user card respectively token based on this TOE and the functionality of the PCD software part
which is implemented in the terminal side. The PCD software operates also on the hardware of this TOE which is
implemented in the terminal.
The CIPURSE™ CL implements the by the OSPT alliance standardized application interface for the card and the
terminal side.
The certification comprises the entire functionality of the optional CIPURSE™ CL implemented and operated on
the TOE hardware. On one hand the TOE can operate the PICC side software part as a token and on the other
hand, a second TOE product operates the PCD side software part if used inside a terminal or similar system.

Public Security Target
Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Target of Evaluation Description


The environment on the terminal, the terminal systems, their security and their interfaces to the background
systems are not in the scope of this certification. The user operating system and further applications
implemented on the TOE are also out of scope of this certification.
To summarize, if used with the PCD software the certification view equals to the case where the TOE is running
the PICC software: The TOE operates one of the optional software parts of the CIPURSE™ CL – regardless
whether PICC or PCD part - and is enabled to communicate via the selected interfaces. The surrounding
environment is in both cases out of scope. The CIPURSE™ CL is delivered as object code and in this way
integrated in the user software.

The NRG software is a further order option, which implements the routines for a NRG interface. The NRG
implements an operating system handling the emulation of an NRG card together with the RF interface. One
part of the NRG software is permanently stored in the ROM and the second part consisting of patch and API is
located in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The second part is only present if the NRG is a part of the delivery. If the
NRG is not part of the delivery the ROM part is present but not used. The NRG implements tearing safe
behaviour in context with the SOLID FLASH™ NVM management and is therefore independent from the HSL.
The NRG NVM part is – if ordered – delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software.
The NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

Note 1:
The asymmetric cryptographic libraries regardless of the version chosen are delivery options.
Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations with the other libraries of or without these libraries. In the
case of coming without one or any combination of the asymmetric libraries the TOE does not provide the
Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or Elliptic Curve
Cryptography (EC).

The symmetric cryptographic library SCL, in two alternative versions, is a delivery option.
Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations with the other libraries of or without these libraries. In the
case of coming without the SCL the TOE does not provide the specific security functionality implemented by this
software. Even in case of a TOE coming without SCL, the symmetric cryptographic functionality is unchanged
covered by the hardware symmetric cryptographic coprocessor SCP.

The presence of the cryptographic library CIPURSE™ CL is a delivery option.
Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations with the other libraries of or without these libraries. In the
case of coming without the CIPURSE™ CL, the TOE does not provide the specific security functionality
implemented by this software.
End of note.

Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Target of Evaluation Description


The firmware and software parts of the TOE comprise:

Firmware
     in several alternative versions,
      whereas the latter version provides additional functionality regarding the TOE identification as order
      option
     Boot Software (BOS)
     Resource Management System (RMS)
     Flash Loader (FL)
     RFAPI functions
      The RFAPI is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
     NRG basic functions in ROM.
      The NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

Optional Software
    RSA cryptographic library in three alternative versions
    EC cryptographic library in three alternative versions
    Toolbox library in three alternative versions.
      None of the Toolbox libraries is part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
    SCL library in two alternative versions
    HSL library in four alternative versions
    CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library
    NRG library.
      The NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).


2.2.3          Interfaces of the TOE
       The physical interface of the TOE to the external environment is the entire surface of the IC.
       The electrical interface of the TOE to the external environment is constituted by the pads of the chip,
        particularly ISO pads, the CLK and power supply pads, as well as the pads used for contactless and
        contact based interfacing.
        A further electrical interface are the La and Lb pads used for the antenna connection and alternatively for
        the ACLB communication mode connecting an external reader chip which is not part of the TOE.
       The RF interface (radio frequency power and signal interface) enables contactless communication
        between a PICC (proximity integration chip card, PICC) and a PCD reader/writer (proximity coupling
        device, PCD). Power supply is received and data are received or transmitted by an antenna which
        consists of a coil with a few turns directly connected to the IC. Depending on customer orders the
        contactless interface options are set by means of blocking either at Infineon premises or at the premises
        of the user.
       The data-oriented I/O interface to the TOE is formed by the pads used for contact based or contactless
        communication.
       The interface to the firmware – regardless of the version chosen – is constituted by special registers used
        for hardware configuration and control (Special Function Registers, SFR).
       The interface of the TOE to the operating system is constituted by the RMS and by the instruction set of
        the TOE.
       The interface of the TOE to the test routines is formed by the BOS test routine call, i.e. entry to the test
        modes.

2.2.4          Guidance documentation
The following provides a brief overview of the document set constituting the user guidance for this TOE. The
exact document titles and versions are given in chapter 9.
    The document Hardware Reference Manual HRM [1] is the user data book of the TOE and contains the
        relevant module, function and feature description
    The document Production and Personalization User Manual [2] contains detailed information about the
        usage of the Flash Loader
    The document Programmers Reference Manual [3] describes the usage and interfaces of the Resource
        Management System RMS, of the NRG Software and of the RFAPI.
    The document [6] Security Guidelines User Manual provides the guidance and recommendations to
        develop secure software for and secure usage of this TOE.
    The document [7] Errata Sheet contains latest updates and corrections of the TOE relevant for the user
        and it is a kind addendum to the hardware reference manual HRM [1]. The Errata Sheet can be changed
        during the life cycle of the TOE. New Errata Sheet releases are reported in a monthly updated list
        provided from Infineon Technologies AG to the user. This list is not part of the certification process. Part
        of the TOE certification is the released version valid at the point in time the certificate was issued.
    The document asymmetric Cryptographic Library ACL [4-1] for Crypto@2304T user interface for the
        version v2.08.007 contains all interfaces of the RSA, EC and Toolbox library and are only delivered to the
        user in case the RSA library and/or the EC library is/are part of the delivered TOE.
    The document asymmetric Cryptographic Library ACL [4-2] for Crypto@2304T user interface for the
        version v2.07.003 contains all interfaces of the RSA, EC and Toolbox library and are only delivered to the
        user in case the RSA library and/or the EC library is/are part of the delivered TOE.
    The document asymmetric Cryptographic Library ACL [4-3] for Crypto@2304T user interface for the

2.2.5          Forms of delivery
The TOE can be delivered:
    in form of complete modules
    with or without inlay mounting
    with or without inlay antenna mounting
    in form of plain wafers
    in any IC case (for example TSSOP28, VQFN32, VQFN40, CCS-modules, etc.)
    in no IC case or package, simply as bare dies
    or in whatever type of package

The form of delivery does not affect the TOE security and it can be delivered in any type, as long as the processes
applied and sites involved have been subject of the appropriate audit.
The delivery can therefore be at the end of phase 3 or at the end of phase 4 which can also include pre-
personalization steps according to PP [9]. Nevertheless in both cases the TOE is finished and the extended test
features are removed. In this document are always both cases mentioned to avoid incorrectness but from the
security policy point of view the two cases are identical.
The delivery to the software developer (phase 2  phase 1) contains the development package and is delivered
in form of documentation as described above, data carriers and/or download from a secure server containing the
tools and emulators as development and debugging tool.
Part of the software delivery can also be the Flash Loader software running on the TOE and receiving the
transmitted information of the user software to be loaded into the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The download is only
possible after successful mutual authentication and the user software can also be downloaded in an encrypted
way. This download can also be done at a third party acting as download service provider for the user. This
organization is subject of the user.
In any case, the user is after finalization of the download and prior delivery to the field obligated to permanently
lock further use of the Flash Loader. How the user can do this is detailed in the user guidance [2].
Note that it depends on the procurement order, whether the Flash Loader program is present or not.

The belonging user guidance documents are delivered in electronic form: Either by user downloads from a secure
server or alternatively on request as encrypted email attachment.

2.2.6          Production sites
The TOE may be handled in different production sites until delivery, but the wafers of this TOE are produced in
Taiwan at two different production sites. For logistic and capacity reasons the production lines have been
doubled and thus this certification comprises the products of both production lines.
To distinguish the different production sites in the field, the two sites are coded into the Generic Chip Ident Mode
(GCIM) data. The exact coding of the generic chip identification data is described in the hardware reference
manual HRM [1].
The delivery measures are described in the ALC_DVS aspect.

The production lines are coded as follows:
Taiwan: One production line is coded with »0Dh« and the other is coded with »0Ah«

Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Conformance Claims (ASE_CCL)


The highest assurance component AVA_VAN.5 Vulnerability Assessment, advanced methodical vulnerability
analysis, is already standard requirement for the EAL6. Thus the augmentation is achieved by another assurance
class.

Conformance Rationale
This security target claims strict conformance only to the PP [9].
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is a typical security IC as defined in PP chapter 1.2.2 comprising:
•       the circuitry of the IC (hardware including the physical memories),
•       configuration data, initialization data related to the IC Dedicated Software and the behavior of the
security functionality
•       the IC Dedicated Software with the parts
•       the IC Dedicated Test Software,
•       the IC Dedicated Support Software.
The TOE is designed, produced and/or generated by the TOE Manufacturer.

Security Problem Definition
Following the PP [9], the security problem definition is enhanced by adding additional threats, organization
security policies and an augmented assumption. Including these add-ons, the security problem definition of this
security target is consistent with the statement of the security problem definition in the PP [9], as the security
target claimed strict conformance to the PP [9].

Conformance Rationale
The augmented organizational security policy P.Add-Functions, coming from the additional security
functionality of the cryptographic libraries, the augmented assumption A.Key-Function, related to the usage of
key-depending function, and the threat memory access violation T.Mem-Access, due to specific TOE memory
access control functionality, have been added. These add-ons have no impact on the conformance statements
regarding CC [10] and PP [9], with following rational:
•        The security target remains conformant to CC [10], claim 482 as the possibility to introduce additional
restrictions is given.
•        The security target fulfils the strict conformance claim of the PP [9] due to the application notes 5, 6 and
7 which apply here. By those notes the addition of further security functions and security services are covered,
even without deriving particular security functionality from a threat but from a policy.



3.1.1          Adding Objectives

Due to additional security functionality coming from
     the cryptographic libraries
            o O.Add-Functions,
     the memory access control
            o O.Mem-Access
     and objectives related to the Flash Loader
            o O.Authentication,

            o O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader and
            o O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality
additional security objectives have been introduced.
These add-ons have no impact on the conformance statements regarding CC [10] and PP [9] with following
rational:

Public Security Target
Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Conformance Claims (ASE_CCL)


       The security target remains conformant to CC [10], claim 482 as the possibility to introduce additional
        restrictions is given.
       The security target fulfils the strict conformance of the PP [9] due to the application note 9 applying
        here. This note allows the definition of high-level security goals due to further functions or services
        provided to the Security IC Embedded Software.


3.1.2          AES and TDES

The PP [9] implements the optional policy cryptographic services P.Crypto_Service with its packages TDES and
AES. This TOE provides these optional packages requiring secure hardware based cryptographic services for the
IC Embedded Software as outlined in chapter 7.1.4.
Due to these optional additional security functionalities the security objectives O.TDES and O.AES have been
introduced. These add-ons have no impact on the conformance statements regarding CC [10] and PP [9], with
following rational:
      The security target fulfils the strict conformance claim of the PP [9] due to the application notes applying
        here. By these notes the addition of further security functions and security services are covered, even
        without deriving particular security functionality from a threat or a policy.


3.1.3          Loader

The PP [9] implements the optional policy for applying a Loader. The Loader is used to load data into the SOLID
FLASH™ NVM.
The Flash Loader provides the service for authentication and implements the Package for Authentication of the
Security IC containing FIA_API.1 Authentication Proof of Identity of the TOE against a user.
This means that the user clearly can identify the TOE on his external request. This fulfils the objective
O.Authentication, authentication to external entities, and obligates an objective to the environment
OE.TOE_Auth, external entities authenticating of the TOE as outlined in the PP [9].
The Loader policy defines the Package 1 with its policy P.LIM_Block_Loader where the Loader is dedicated for
usage in secured environment only and the Package 2 with its policy P.Ctlr_Loader where the Loader is
dedicated for usage by authorized users only.
 This TOE provides a Flash Loader complying with the optional packages:
       Package 1:
        Loader dedicated for usage in secured environment only
       Package 2:
        Loader dedicated for usage by authorized users only as outlined in sections 7.2 and 7.3 of the PP [9]
 Due to these optional additional security functionalities the security objectives
    O.Cap_Avail_Loader, capability and availability of the Loader,
    O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader, access control and authenticity for the Loader and
    OE.Loader_Usage. secure communication and usage of the Loader
    O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality, protection of the confidentiality of the TSF
    OE.Lim_Block_Loader, limitation of capability and blocking the Loader
have been introduced.

3.1.4         CIPURSE Cryptographic Library (CCL)

The TOE provides “Additional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions)” including the CIPURSE™
Cryptography. This cryptographic functionality implements additional cryptographic services by implementation
of a protocol providing a secure mutual authentication of two entities, namely the terminal (denoted as PCD =
Proximity Coupling Device (CIPURSE™-compliant terminal)) and a smart card or a token in other form factors
which is called PICC. PICC stands for Proximity Integrated Circuit Card (CIPURSE™-compliant card).
Beside the mutual authentication, the protocol implements measures to maintain the integrity of the transferred
data and preserves in parallel the confidentiality of the transferred data.
Due to these additional security functionalities the security objectives
     O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL
     O.Prot_Integrity
     O.Prot_Confidentiality
have been introduced.

3.1.5          Summary

All of the above add-ons have no impact on the conformance statements regarding CC [10] and PP [9], with
following rational:
The security target fulfils the strict conformance claim of the PP [9] due to the application notes 9 applying here.
By this note the addition of further security functions and security services are covered, even without deriving
particular security functionality from a threat or a policy.
Due to the above rational, the security objectives of this security target are consistent with the statement of the
security objectives in the PP [9], as the security target claims package augmentation to the PP [9].
All security functional requirements defined in the PP [9] are included and completely defined in this ST.
A listing of all security functional requirements and where those are taken from is given in chapter 7.1.

The following security functional requirement is included and completely defined in this ST, section 6.

The content of the PP [9] applies to this chapter completely.


4.1            Threats
The threats are directed against the assets and/or the security functions of the TOE. For example, certain attacks
are only one step towards a disclosure of assets while others may directly lead to a compromise of the
application security. The more detailed description of specific attacks is given later on in the process of
evaluation and certification.
The threats to security are defined and described in PP [9] section 3.2, respectively for T.Masquerade_TOE in
chapter 7.2.1.

4.1.1          Additional Threat due to TOE specific Functionality
Threat Memory Access Violation
The additional functionality of introducing sophisticated privilege levels and access control allows the secure
separation between the operation system(s) and applications, the secure downloading of applications after
personalization and enables multitasking by separating memory areas and performing access controls between
different applications. Due to this additional functionality “area based memory access control” a new threat is
introduced.
The Smartcard Embedded Software is responsible for its User data of the Composite TOE according to the
assumption “Treatment of User data of the Composite TOE (A.Resp-Appl)”. However, the Smartcard Embedded
Software may comprise different parts, for instance an operating system and one or more applications. In this
case, such parts may accidentally or deliberately access data (including code) of other parts, which may result in
a security violation.

The TOE shall avert the threat “Memory Access Violation (T.Mem-Access)” as specified below:

 T.Mem-            Memory Access Violation
 Access
                   Parts of the Smartcard Embedded Software may cause security violations by accidentally or
                   deliberately accessing restricted data (which may include code) or privilege levels. Any
                   restrictions are defined by the security policy of the specific application context and must be
                   implemented by the Smartcard Embedded Software.

Threat Diffusion of Open Samples
The additional functionality of a Loader as defined in the PP [9], section 7.3 requires to address the following
threat, as defined in the document “PP0084: Interpretation” [9.1].
The TOE shall avert the threat “Diffusion of open Samples (T.Open_Samples_Diffusion)” as specified below:

 T.Open_Samples_Diffusion         Diffusion of Open Samples
                                  An attacker may get access to open samples of the TOE and use them to gain
                                  information about the TSF (loader, memory management unit, ROM code …).
                                  He may also use the open samples to characterize the behavior of the IC and its
                                  security functionalities (for example: characterization of side channel profiles,
                                  perturbation cartography …). The execution of a dedicated security features
                                  (for example: execution of a DES computation without countermeasures or by
                                  de-activating countermeasures) through the loading of an adequate code
                                  would allow this kind of characterization and the execution of enhanced
                                  attacks on the IC.

Note:
This threat is only relevant if the Flash Loader is still available and the attacker would in addition have the
authentication key. If both would be given, then this would enable downloading additional software.
End of note.

4.1.2          Assets regarding the Threats
The primary assets concern the User data which includes the user data of the Composite TOE as well as program
code (Security IC Embedded Software) stored and in operation and the provided security services. These assets
have to be protected while being executed and or processed and on the other hand, when the TOE is not in
operation.
This leads to four primary assets with its related security concerns:
     SC1 integrity of user data of the Composite TOE
     SC2 confidentiality of user data of the Composite TOE being stored in the TOE’s protected memory
        areas
     SC3 correct operation of the security services provided by the TOE for the Security IC Embedded
        Software
     SC4 continuous availability of random numbers
SC4 is an additional security service provided by this TOE which is the availability of random numbers. These
random numbers are generated either by a true random number or a deterministic random number generator or

by both, when a true random number is used as seed for the deterministic random number generator. Note that
the generation of random numbers is a requirement of the PP [9].
To be able to protect the listed assets the TOE shall protect its security functionality as well. Therefore critical
information about the TOE shall be protected. Critical information includes:
      logical design data, physical design data, IC Dedicated Software, and configuration data
      Initialization Data and Pre-personalization Data, specific development aids, test and characterization
        related data, material for software development support, and reticles.
The information and material produced and/or processed by the TOE Manufacturer in the TOE development and
production environment (Phases 2 up to TOE Delivery) can be grouped as follows:
      logical design data,
      physical design data,
      IC Dedicated Software, Security IC Embedded Software, Initialization Data and Pre-personalization
        Data,
      specific development aids,
      test and characterization related data,
      material for software development support, and
      reticles and products in any form
as long as they are generated, stored, or processed by the TOE Manufacturer.
For details see PP [9] section 3.1.


4.2            Organizational Security Policies
The TOE has to be protected during the first phases of their lifecycle (phases 2 up to TOE delivery which can be
after phase 3 or phase 4). Later on each variant of the TOE has to protect itself. The organizational security policy
according to PP [9] covers this aspect.

 P.Process-TOE              Identification during TOE Development and Production
                            An accurate identification must be established for the TOE. This requires that each
                            instantiation of the TOE carries this unique identification.

Due to the augmentations of PP [9] and the chosen packages additional policies are introduced and described in
the next chapter.

4.2.1          Augmented Organizational Security Policy
Due to the augmentations of the PP [9] and the chosen packages additional policies are introduced.
The TOE provides specific security functionality, which can be used by the Smartcard Embedded Software. In the
following specific security functionality is listed which is not derived from threats identified for the TOE’s
environment because it can only be decided in the context of the smartcard application, against which threats
the Smartcard Embedded Software will use the specific security functionality.
The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the policy “Additional Specific Security Functionality
(P.Add-Functions)” as specified below.

P.Add-Functions                   Additional Specific Security Functionality
                                  The TOE shall provide the following specific security functionality to the
                                  Smartcard Embedded Software:
                                      Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA)
                                      Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC)
                                      CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CCL)
                                      Cipher based Message Authentication Code (CMAC by the SCL-1)

Note 2:
The cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL, and the Toolbox library as stated in chapter 1.1 are delivery
options. Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations of or even without these libraries. In the case of
coming without one or any combination of the cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL, the TOE does not
provide the Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or Elliptic
Curve Cryptography (EC) and/or CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library and/or Cipher based Message Authentication
Code (CMAC by SCL-1).
The Toolbox Library is no cryptographic library, provides no additional specific security functionality and thus the
Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
End of note.

The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the organizational security policy “Cryptographic services of the
TOE (P.Crypto-Service)” as specified below:

 P.Crypto-Service              Cryptographic services of the TOE
                               The TOE provides secure hardware based cryptographic services for the IC
                               Embedded Software.
                                   Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES)
                                   Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

Note 3:
This TOE can come with both cryptographic coprocessors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked
Crypto2304T, or with both crypto co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior
to the production of the hardware. In case the SCP is blocked, no AES and DES respectively CMAC computation
supported by hardware or SCL is possible. In case the Crypto2304T is blocked, no RSA and EC computation – of
any version as stated in chapter 1.1 - supported by hardware is possible. No accessibility of the deselected
cryptographic co-processors is without impact on any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to
the situation where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic co-processors.

Security Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)


The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the organizational security policy “Limiting and Blocking the Loader
Functionality (P.Lim_Block_Loader)” as specified below:

 P.Lim_Block_Loader             Limiting and Blocking the Loader Functionality
                                The composite manufacturer uses the Loader for loading of Security IC
                                Embedded Software, user data of the Composite Product or IC Dedicated
                                Support Software in charge of the IC Manufacturer. He limits the capability
                                and blocks the availability of the Loader in order to protect stored data from
                                disclosure and manipulation.
 P.Ctrl_Loader                  Controlled usage to Loader Functionality
                                Authorized user controls the usage of the Loader functionality in order to
                                protect stored and loaded user data from disclosure and manipulation.



4.3           Assumptions
The TOE assumptions on the operational environment are defined and described in PP [9] section 3.4.
The assumptions concern the phases where the TOE has left the chip manufacturer.
The support of cipher schemas requires an additional assumption.

 A.Process-Sec-IC                Protection during Packaging, Finishing and Personalization
                                 It is assumed that security procedures are used after delivery of the TOE by
                                 the TOE Manufacturer up to delivery to the end-consumer to maintain
                                 confidentiality and integrity of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test
                                 data (to prevent any possible copy, modification, retention, theft or
                                 unauthorized use).
 A.Resp-Appl                     Treatment of User data of the Composite TOE
                                 All User data of the Composite TOE are owned by Security IC Embedded
                                 Software. Therefore, it must be assumed that security relevant User data of
                                 the Composite TOE (especially cryptographic keys) are treated by the
                                 Security IC Embedded Software as defined for its specific application context.


4.3.1         Augmented Assumptions
The developer of the Smartcard Embedded Software must ensure the appropriate “Usage of Key-dependent
Functions (A.Key-Function)” while developing this software in Phase 1 as specified below.

 A.Key-Function               Usage of Key-dependent Functions
                              Key-dependent functions (if any) shall be implemented in the Smartcard
                              Embedded Software in a way that they are not susceptible to leakage attacks
                              (as described under T.Leak-Inherent and T.Leak-Forced).

Note that here the routines which may compromise keys when being executed are part of the Smartcard
Embedded Software. In contrast to this the threats T.Leak-Inherent and T.Leak-Forced address (i) the
cryptographic routines which are part of the TOE. For details please refer to PP [9] section 3.4.

4.3.2          Note regarding CIPURSE™ CL
The CIPURSE™ CL as cryptographic functionality establishes a cryptographic secured communication channel
between two identified entities. Depending on the implementation and usage, the CIPURSE™ CL can act either
in the PICC or in the PCD role. In any case the secrets applied for establishing and usage of the secured channel
must be treated in an appropriate way by both entities PICC and PCD.
This means that it is essential on user side that the critical data for establishing this cryptographic secured
communication channel is generated and stored in an appropriate way and that integrity and confidentiality is
maintained.
These preconditions are treated in the PP [9] section 3.1 claims 67 and 68, and are the reason for not placing an
assumption here.

Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)



 5             Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)
This section shows the subjects and objects where are relevant to the TOE.
A short overview is given in the following.
The user has the following standard high-level security goals related to the assets:
     SG1 maintain the integrity of user data (when being executed/processed and when being stored in the
        TOE´s memories)
     SG2 maintain the confidentiality of user data (when being executed/processed and when being stored in
        the TOE´s memories)
     SG3 maintain the correct operation of the security services provided by the TOE for the Security IC
        Embedded Software
     SG4 provision of random numbers.


5.1            Security objectives for the TOE
The security objectives of the TOE are defined and described in PP [9] section 4.1, 7.2.1, 7.3.1, 7.3.2, 7.4.1 and

Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


Note 4:
The objectives O.Cap_Avail_Loader, O. Authentication, O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader and O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality
apply only at TOE products coming with activated Flash Loader enabled for software or data download by the
user. In other cases the Flash Loader is not available anymore and the user software or data download is
completed. Depending on the capabilities of the user software these objectives may then reoccur as subject of
the composite TOE.
End of note.

The TOE provides “Additional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions)” as specified below.

 O.Add-Functions              Additional Specific Security Functionality
                              The TOE must provide the following specific security functionality to the
                              Smartcard Embedded Software:
                                  Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA)
                                  Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC)
                                  CIPURSE™ Cryptography
                                  Cipher base Message authentication code (CMAC)

Note 5:
The cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL and the Toolbox library are delivery options, regardless of the
version chosen. Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations of or even without these libraries. In the
case of coming without one or any combination of the cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, SCL, CCL the TOE does
not provide the Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC) and/or CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library and/or Cipher based Message
Authentication Code (CMAC by the SCL-1).
The Toolbox Library is no cryptographic library, provides no additional specific security functionality and thus the
Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
End of note.

Note 6:
This TOE can come with both crypto co-processors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked
Crypto2304T, or with both crypto co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior
to the production of the hardware. In case the SCP is blocked, no AES and DES computation supported by
hardware is possible. In case the Crypto2304T is blocked, no RSA and EC computation – in any of the version
stated in chapter 1.1 – supported by hardware is possible. No accessibility of the deselected cryptographic co-
processors is without impact on any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the situation
where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic co-processors.
End of note.

Note 7:
In case the SCP is blocked, no AES, no DES and no Cipher based Message Authentication Code (CMAC by SCL)
computation supported by hardware is possible and thus the CIPURSE™ CL and SCL usage is not possible. This is
regardless of the library version chosen.
End of note.

The TOE shall provide “Area based Memory Access Control (O.Mem-Access)” as specified below.

 O.Mem Access                Area based Memory Access Control
                             The TOE must provide the Smartcard Embedded Software with the capability to
                             define restricted access memory areas. The TOE must then enforce the
                             partitioning of such memory areas so that access of software to memory areas and
                             privilege levels is controlled as required, for example, in a multi-application
                             environment.

The additional functionality of a Loader as defined in the PP [9], section 7.3 requires to address the following
objective, as defined in the document “PP0084: Interpretation” [9.1].
The TOE shall provide “Protection of the confidentiality of the TSF (O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality)” as specified
below:

O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality Protection of the confidentiality of the TSF
                           The TOE must provide protection against disclosure of confidential operations of
                           the Security IC (loader, memory management unit …) through the use of a
                           dedicated code loaded on open samples.

document:

 O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL              Authentication of entities
                              The CIPURSE™ CL must implement mutual authentication to establish a ready to

                              any other communication between the two entities is applied.

 O.Prot_Integrity             Integrity protection
                              The CIPURSE™ CL must implement integrity protection functionality for the user
                              data to be exchanged via the secure communication channel.

 O.Prot_Confidentiality Confidentiality protection
                        The CIPURSE™ CL must protect the confidentiality of the user data to be

5.2            Security Objectives from PP for development and environment
The security objectives for the security IC embedded software development environment and the operational
environment are defined in PP [9] section 4.2, 4.3, 7.2.1and 7.3.

For secure use of the CIPURSE™ CL it is essential that on user side the common secret is generated and stored in
an appropriate way and that integrity and confidentiality of this user secret is maintained. These preconditions
are treated in the PP [9] section 3.1 claims 67 and 68.

The operational environment of the TOE shall provide “Limitation of capability and blocking the Loader
“OE.Lim_Block_Loader”, “External entities authentication of the TOE “OE.TOE_Auth" and “Secure
communication and usage of the Loader “OE.Loader¬Usage” as specified below:

 OE.Lim_Block_Loader            Limitation of capability and blocking the Loader
                                The Composite Product Manufacturer will protect the Loader functionality
                                against misuse, limit the capability of the Loader and terminate irreversibly
                                the Loader after intended usage of the Loader.
 OE.TOE_Auth                    Authentication to external entities
                                The operational environment shall support the authentication verification
                                mechanism and know authentication reference data of the TOE.
 OE.Loader_Usage                Secure communication and usage of the Loader
                                The authorized user must support the trusted communication with the TOE by
                                confidentiality protection and authenticity proof of the data to be loaded and
                                fulfilling the access conditions required by the Loader.

                                The protection during packaging, finishing and personalization includes also
                                the personalization process (Flash Loader) and the personalization data (TOE
                                software components) during Phase 4, Phase 5 and Phase 6.

End of note.


5.3            Security Objectives for the Environment
Since the CIPURSE™ CL requires the presence of a common secret on both communication entities an additional
objective for the environment is generated:
Following objectives are defined here.

 OE.Resp-Appl                  Treatment of User data of the Composite TOE
                               Please refer to chapter 5.3.1 for clarification

Note 9:
The CIPURSE™ CL is a delivery option. In case the user has ordered the CIPURSE™ CL, the user is responsible to
implement the CIPURSE™ CL into his user software. In addition, the user has to generate and treat the common
secret in an appropriate way. The objective common secret is therefore similar to the OE.Resp-Appl. Anyhow,
processes and treatment is exclusively subject of the user and his logistic processes.
End of note.

Note 10:
If the user decides to use the integrity protection mode of the CIPURSE™ CL then the confidentiality of the user
data to be transferred is solely subject of the user.
End of note.

Note 11:
The CIPURSE™ CL as cryptographic functionality establishes a cryptographic secured communication channel
between two identified entities. Depending on the implementation and usage, the CIPURSE™ CL can act either
in the PICC or in the PCD role. In any case the secrets applied for establishing and usage of the secured channel

(1) These objectives are only valid if the TOE is delivered with active Flash Loader.


5.3.1          Clarification of “Treatment of User Data (OE.Resp-Appl)”
Regarding the cryptographic services this objective of the environment has to be clarified.
By definition cipher or plain text data and cryptographic keys are user data of the Composite TOE. The
Smartcard Embedded Software shall treat these data appropriately, use only proper secret keys (chosen from a
large key space) as input for the cryptographic function of the TOE and use keys and functions appropriately in
order to ensure the strength of cryptographic operation.
This means that keys are treated as confidential as soon as they are generated. The keys must be unique with a
very high probability, as well as cryptographically strong. For example, it must be ensured that it is beyond
practicality to derive the private key from a public key if asymmetric algorithms are used. If keys are imported
into the TOE and/or derived from other keys, quality and confidentiality must be maintained. This implies that
appropriate key management has to be realized in the environment.
Regarding the memory, software and firmware protection and the SFR and peripheral access rights handling
these objectives of the environment has to be clarified. The treatment of user data of the Composite TOE is also
required when a multi-application operating system is implemented as part of the Smartcard Embedded
Software on the TOE. In this case the multi-application operating system should not disclose security relevant
user data of one application to another application when it is processed or stored on the TOE.


5.3.2     Clarification of “Protection during Composite product Manufacturing
(OE.Process-Sec-IC)”
The protection during packaging, finishing and personalization includes also the personalization process (Flash
Loader) and the personalization data (TOE software components) during Phase 4, Phase 5 and Phase 6.

Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


 5.5           P.Add-Functions
The justification related to the security objective “Additional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions)”
is as follows: Since O.Add-Functions requires the TOE to implement exactly the same specific security
functionality as required by P.Add-Functions; the organizational security policy is covered by the objective.

Nevertheless the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing, O.Malfunction, O.Phys-Manipulation and
O.Leak-Forced define how to implement the specific security functionality required by P.Add-Functions. (Note
that these objectives support that the specific security functionality is provided in a secure way as expected from
P.Add-Functions.) Especially O.Leak-Inherent and O.Leak-Forced refer to the protection of confidential data
(User data of the Composite TOE or TSF data) in general. User data of the Composite TOE are also processed by
the specific security functionality required by P.Add-Functions.

The policy P.Add functions includes the function CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CCL). This functionality
implements the objectives O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL, O.Prot_Integrity and O.Prot_Confidentiality. The CIPURSE™
Cryptographic Library (CCL) first prepares and establishes a secure communication channel between two
authenticated entities. The mutual authentication means covers the objective O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL. The
implemented means of session key generation and integrity protection prepares for the confidential and
integrity protected exchange of user data between the two authenticated entities. Thus the objectives
O.Prot_Integrity and O.Prot_Confidentiality are covered too.

The policy P.Add functions includes the function Cipher base Message authentication code (CMAC). This
functionality is implemented by the optional software SCL and implements the option to protect the integrity of
a user data block with a message authentication code. The computing of the CMAC requires the use of either
AES or TDES, as outlined in the chapter P.Crypto-Service 5.9 and also implemented by the optional software
SCL.


 5.6           A.Key-Function
Compared to the PP [9] a further clarification has been made for the security objective “Treatment of user data
of the Composite TOE (OE.Resp-Appl)”: By definition cipher or plain text data and cryptographic keys are user
data of the Composite TOE. So, the Smartcard Embedded Software will protect such data if required and use
keys and functions appropriately in order to ensure the strength of cryptographic operation. Quality and
confidentiality must be maintained for keys that are imported and/or derived from other keys. This implies that
appropriate key management has to be realized in the environment. That is expressed by the assumption
A.Key—Function which is covered from OE.Resp–Appl. These measures make sure that the assumption
A.Resp-Appl is still covered by the security objective OE.Resp-Appl although additional functions are being
supported according to P.Add-Functions.

Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


 5.7           T.Mem-Access
Compared to the PP [9] an enhancement regarding memory area protection has been established. The clear
definition of privilege levels for operated software establishes the clear separation of different restricted memory
areas for running the firmware – regardless of the version in use -, downloading and/or running the operating
system and to establish a clear separation between different applications. Nevertheless, it is also possible to
define a shared memory section where separated applications may exchange defined data. The privilege levels
clearly define by using a hierarchical model the access right from one level to the other. These measures ensure
that the threat T.Mem-Access is clearly covered by the security objective O.Mem-Access.


 5.8           P.Ctrl_Loader, P.Lim_Block_Loader, T.Masquerade_TOE and
               T.Open_Samples_Diffusion
The PP [9] section 7.3 considers the life cycle phases of the TOE also with the organizational policy
P.Lim_Block_Loader and P.Ctlr_Loader as the TOE must be protected against unauthorized usage and control
and against download of malicious software before, during and after the user downloads his software. This is
formalized with the objectives O.Cap_Avail_Loader, O.Authentication and O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader requiring
authentication of the TOE to external entities and a trusted communication channel. The O.Authentication
implements a mutual authentication and involves the environment therefore.
And the policies cover also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must be
regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.
The implemented mutual authentication requires first to authenticate the TOE to the external user. This requires
also knowledge by the user about the sequence of the protocol, interpretation of the transferred data and how to
start the authentication of the TOE. This authentication mean counters the threat T.Masquerade_TOE as only
the genuine TOE is able to identify itself correctly to the enabled user, which covers O.Authentication.
The second step of the mutual authentications mean implements the authentication of the user to the TOE. Only
the user enabled to present the correct authentication data and knowing about the sequence, data
interpretation and signaling of the authentication to the TOE is able to proceed further on.
This enforces OE.TOE_Auth, requiring the support of the verification mechanism and known authentication
reference data by the operational environment.

It is normal business that products enabled for software download by the user are either on their way to the user
or are already stored at user premises. At both situations it cannot be excluded that an attacker could manage to
steal such products enabled for software downloads. The ability to download software on a chip without
operating system and/or application is defined as open sample.
This situation generates the threat T.Open_Samples_Diffusion which is defined as follows:
The download of analysis software could enable an attacker to characterize the product and to construct an
attack path out of the gained information.
This threat is countered by the Flash Loader by following rational:
As long as the Flash Loader is active, controlled usage to the Flash Loader functionality (P.Ctrl_Loader) is
enforced which protects the TOE from achieving the status of being an open sample. And more, even the
attacker could observe, meaning in the sense of measurements during, or induce faults during an authorized
download, the Flash Loader protects the user data of the download by confidentiality and integrity protection
means. The Flash Loader functionalities of mutual authentication, establishing a dedicated trusted
communication channel, the encryption and integrity protection means cover the objectives
O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality, O.Leak-Inherent and O.Leak-Forced.
The policy P.Ctrl_Loader covers also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must
be regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.

Note regarding the Flash Loader:

Public Security Target
Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


The algorithm strength of the Flash Loader has not been cryptographic-analytically evaluated by the BSI, as
Infineon has implemented a proprietary extension.
End of note.

The objective O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader Access control and authenticity for the Loader is covered by following
rational:
The identification of the communication entities of the Flash Loader requires the presence of dedicated
identification data for passing successfully the mutual authentication. This enforces the policy P.Ctrl_Loader
comprising the aspect of the mutual authentication. After successful authentication the user is enabled to
change the keys used for authentication and downloading the user data. This first user is defined as the
administrator. The TOE can then further be operated for example by a service partner who is defined as being
the Download Operator. The equal protecting means as for the Administrator apply here again but due to the
key change different roles are established. The Download Operator downloads then the encrypted user data
with the Flash Loader into the defined and accessible SOLID FLASH™ NVM area. This area is access protected by
the MMU.
The policy O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader covers also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it
must be regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.

This objective O.Leak-Inherent is covered with following rational:
This false download threat is countered with the mutual authentication mean as only the correct identified user
is able to download the user intended software and data. Since it is not practical for an attacker to authenticate
correctly a threatening download of attack software is countered. By that possible confidential user data already
stored on the TOE remain protected from disclosure by this method.
If the user is the attacker, or does not follow the user guidance, or bad designed user software implements
weaknesses, the user data remain protected anyway, since even after passing the mutual authentication of the
loader the download is conducted encrypted only. And even more, a different encryption is applied to store the
data in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. Since also the number of Flash Loader trials is limited even comprehensive
side channel analysis would not leave sufficient information to conduct a successful attack.
The implemented authentication means cover also the environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user
premises, as it must be regardless in which environment the Flash Loader is operated.

This objective O.Leak-Forced is covered with following rational:
Another method to gain information is to force information leakage of confidential data processed in the TOE.
Such forcing requires malfunction or physical manipulation. Inducing errors of any kind during data processing
will be discovered by the Integrity Guard with high probability which leads to a security reset. Failures induced
during the mutual authentication or encrypted download process of the Flash Loader will also be discovered as
the perturbation of the sequences leads to fail of the process with trial counter decrement or a fail of the integrity
check of the downloaded data will occur. It would anyway not be practical to induce targeted errors as any
process managing data is protected due to the permanent and differently data encryption and integrity
protection on the TOE.
Physical static manipulation requires the presence of a worthwhile target. This is on one hand hard to identify
and would require intensive reverse engineering due to the topological means such as synthesis of the TOE and
other means. But, on the other hand, if we assume than an attacker could identify such spot, and the physical
preparation was successful too and thus it was possible to probe the targeted signal, then, even assumed the
attacker could analyze the traffic on the signal, the results would be worthless, since the signal data is encrypted
or masked. Thus, the data remains confidentiality protected even outside the TOE, since the analyst neither has
neither the encryption algorithm nor the key.
The Integrity Guard concept and encryption of memory contents are always present and cover also the
environmental objective OE.Process-Sec-IC at user premises, as it must be regardless in which environment the
Flash Loader is operated.

Public Security Target
Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Security objectives (ASE_OBJ)


All requirements are fulfilled by the Flash Loader due the strong mutual authentication means enabling only the
authorized user for the download, due to the download of encrypted data only and due to the final locking
command to be applied by the user before delivery. As a consequence the operational environment objectives
OE.Lim_Block_Loader, OE.TOE_Auth and OE.Loader_Usage obligate the composite manufacturer to protect
the authentication data (e.g. keys) against misuse and limit the capability of the Loader.
In addition, the user guidance implements the obligation to permanent disable the Flash Loader prior delivery to
the end-user.

The package 1 defines the final locking of the Flash Loader prior delivery to the end-user and the usage in secure
environment. The package 2 defines that the Flash Loader can be used also in insecure environment. By claiming
both packages the user has the choice to apply the active Flash Loader either in insecure or in secure
environment and achieves by that a maximum of flexibility. Anyhow, the user is obligated to lock the Flash
Loader prior delivery to the end-user in both cases. This is an obligation implemented by the user guidance.
The Flash Loader provides the required functionality to be applied by the composite manufacturer for covering
these objectives.

The objectives O.Cap_Avail_Loader, O.Authentication, O.Loader_Usage and O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality and
the organizational policies P.Lim_Block_Loader and P.Ctlr_Loader as discussed in the PP [9] section 7.2 and 7.3
apply only at TOE products at the life cycle phase delivery, if these products come with activated Flash Loader
enabled for software or data download by the user. In other cases the Flash Loader is not available anymore and
the user software or data download is completed. Depending on the capabilities of the user software these
objectives may then reoccur as subject of the composite TOE.

 5.9          P.Crypto-Service
The PP [9] includes the organizational security policy P.Crypto-Service Cryptographic services of the TOE in a
different extend as it formalizes the objectives O.TDES and O.AES.
For the objective O.TDES a concrete standard reference (NIST) with operational modes is given the
implementation must follow and also the cryptographic key destruction is regulated. The implementation
complies to the given security functional requirements and the objective O.TDES is met.
For the objective O.AES a concrete standard reference (NIST) with a selection of key lengths is given the
implementation must follow and also the cryptographic key destruction is regulated. The implementation
complies to the given security functional requirements and the objective O.AES is met.
For the objective O.AES a concrete standard reference with an algorithm selection is given the implementation
must follow. The implementation complies to the given security functional requirements and the objective
O.AES is met.
The justification of the additional policy and the additional assumption show that they do not contradict to the
rationale already given in the Protection Profile for the assumptions, policy and threats defined there.

Extended Component Definition (ASE_ECD)




6             Extended Component Definition (ASE_ECD)
There are following extended components defined and described for the TOE:
     the family FCS_RNG at the class FCS Cryptographic Support
     the family FMT_LIM at the class FMT Security Management
     the family FAU_SAS at the class FAU Security Audit
     the component FDP_SDC.1 at the class FDP User Data Protection
     the component FPT_TST.2 at the class FPT Protection of the TSF
     the component FIA_API.1 at the class FIA Identification and Authentication
The extended components FCS_RNG, FMT_LIM, FAU_SAS, FDP_SDC and FIA_API are defined and described in
PP [9] section 5 and the extended component FIA_API is defined and described in PP [9] section 7.2.
The component FPT_TST.2 is defined in the following.


6.1           Component Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)
The security is strongly dependent on the correct operation of the security functions. Therefore, the TOE shall
support that particular security functions or mechanisms are tested in the operational phase (Phase 7). The tests
can be initiated by the Smartcard Embedded Software and/or by the TOE or is done automatically and
continuously.
Part 2 of the Common Criteria provides the security functional component “TSF testing (FPT_TST.1)”. The
component FPT_TST.1 provides the ability to test the TSF’s correct operation.
For the user it is important to know which security functions or mechanisms can be tested. The functional
component FPT_TST.1 does not mandate to explicitly specify the security functions being tested. In addition,
FPT_TST.1 requires verification of the integrity of TSF data and of the stored TSF executable code which might
violate the security policy. Therefore, the functional component ”Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)” of
the family TSF self-test has been newly created. This component allows that particular parts of the security
mechanisms and functions provided by the TOE are tested.

 6.1.1        Definition of FPT_TST.2
The functional component “Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)” has been newly created (Common Criteria
Part 2 extended). This component allows that particular parts of the security mechanisms and functions provided
by the TOE can be tested after TOE Delivery or are tested automatically and continuously during normal
operation transparent for the user.
This security functional component is used instead of the functional component FPT_TST.1 from Common
Criteria Part 2. For the user it is important to know which security functions or mechanisms can be tested. The
functional component FPT_TST.1 does not mandate to explicitly specify the security functions being tested. In
addition, FPT_TST.1 requires verifying the integrity of TSF data and stored TSF executable code which might
violate the security policy.
The functional component “Subset TOE testing (FPT_TST.2)” is specified as follows (Common Criteria Part 2
extended).

   (1) Applies in two alternative operation modes: one mode preserves integrity protected communication and
       the second preserves integrity and confidential communication. Choosing the mode is up to the user and
       his responsibility. For example, the integrity protected mode can be used at secure premises, i.e. where
       eavesdropping is no issue, and the second mode can be applied where the environment is out of control
       of the user.
   (2) These security functional requirements SFR apply only if the SCL- meaning one of the two alternatives -
       is on board of the delivered TOE products.
   (3) Note that the assignment of the in the table above selected SFRs to Flash Loader or CIPURSE™ CL do
       not implement an augmentation as the extension it is just to clarify the part of the TOE claiming the

Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)


All assignments and selections of the security functional requirements of the TOE are done in PP [9] and in the
following description.
Notes:
      The security functional requirements valid for the ACL in all alternative versions ACL-1 to ACL-3 are
         FCS_CKM.1/EC, FCS_CKM.1/RSA, FCS_COP.1/ECDH, FCS_COP.1/ECDSA and FCS_COP.1/RSA. These
         SFRs apply only if the corresponding asymmetric cryptographic library is on bard.
      The security functional requirements FMT_LIM.1/Loader, FMT_LIM.2/Loader, FIA_API.1, FTP_ITC.1,
         FDP_UCT.1, FDP_UIT.1, FDP_ACC.1/Loader and FDP_ACF.1/Loader applying only at TOE products
         coming with activated Flash Loader enabled for user data download. In other cases the Flash Loader is
         not available anymore and the user data download is completed. Depending on the capabilities of the
         user software these security functional requirements may then reoccur as subject of the composite TOE.
      The security functional requirements FCS_COP.1/CCL, FCS_CKM.1/CCL, FCS_CKM.4/CCL apply only if
         the CCL is on board and if the operation mode confidential communication is chosen.


7.1.1          Extended Components FCS_RNG.1 and FAU_SAS.1

7.1.1.1        FCS_RNG
To define the IT security functional requirements of the TOE an additional family (FCS_RNG) of the Class FCS
(cryptographic support) is defined in the PP [9]. This family describes the functional requirements for random
number generation used for cryptographic purposes.

Please note that the national regulation are outlined in PP [9] chapter 7.5.1 and in AIS31 [13]. These regulations
apply for this TOE.

Note 12:
The functional requirements FCS_RNG.1/TRNG, FCS_RNG.1/HPRG, FCS_RNG.1/DRNG, FCS_RNG.1/KSG, are

7.1.3          Memory access control
Usage of multiple applications in one Smartcard often requires code and data separation in order to prevent that
one application can access code and/or data of another application. For this reason the TOE provides Area based
Memory Access Control. The underlying memory management unit (MMU) is documented in section 4 in the
hardware reference manual HRM [1].
The security service being provided is described in the Security Function Policy (SFP) Memory Access Control
Policy. The security functional requirement “Subset access control (FDP_ACC.1)” requires that this policy is in
place and defines the scope were it applies. The security functional requirement “Security attribute based
access control (FDP_ACF.1)” defines security attribute usage and characteristics of policies. It describes the
rules for the function that implements the Security Function Policy (SFP) as identified in FDP_ACC.1. The
decision whether an access is permitted or not is taken based upon attributes allocated to the software. The
Smartcard Embedded Software defines the attributes and memory areas. The corresponding permission control
information is evaluated “on-the-fly” by the hardware so that access is granted/effective or denied/inoperable.
The security functional requirement “Static attribute initialization (FMT_MSA.3)” ensures that the default
values of security attributes are appropriately either permissive or restrictive in nature. Alternative values can be
specified by any subject provided that the Memory Access Control Policy allows that. This is described by the
security functional requirement “Management of security attributes (FMT_MSA.1)”. The attributes are
determined during TOE manufacturing (FMT_MSA.3) or set at run-time (FMT_MSA.1).
From TOE’s point of view the different roles in the Smartcard Embedded Software can be distinguished
according to the memory based access control. However the definition of the roles belongs to the user software.
The following Security Function Policy (SFP) Memory Access Control Policy is defined for the requirement
“Security attribute based access control (FDP_ACF.1)”:

Memory Access Control Policy
The TOE shall control read, write, delete and execute accesses of software running at the privilege levels as defined
below. Any access is controlled, regardless whether the access is on code or data or a jump on any other privilege
level outside the current one.

The memory model provides distinct, independent privilege levels separated from each other in the virtual
address space. The access rights are controlled by the MMU and related to the privilege level. More information
is given in the confidential Security Target [8].

The TOE shall meet the requirement “Subset access control (FDP_ACC.1)” as specified below.

7.1.4               Support of Cipher Schemes
The following additional specific security functionality is implemented in the TOE:
FCS_COP.1 Cryptographic operation requires a cryptographic operation to be performed in accordance with a
specified algorithm and with a cryptographic key of specified sizes. The specified algorithm and cryptographic
key sizes can be based on an assigned standard; dependencies are discussed in chapter 0.

The following additional specific security functionality is implemented in the TOE:
    Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)1
    Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC)1
    Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
    Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES)
    Cipher based Message Authentication Code (CMAC)
    CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CCL)

The RSA cryptographic library, regardless of the version chosen, is offered in two parts: The 2k part of the RSA
library can be used for key lengths of up to 2048 bits and the 4k part of the RSA library can be used for key
lengths of up to 4096 bits.

Note 14:
This TOE can come with both crypto co-processors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked
Crypto2304T, or with both crypto co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior
to the production of the hardware. In case the SCP is blocked, no AES and DES respectively CMAC computation,
as well as CCL operation supported by hardware is possible. In case the Crypto2304T is blocked, no RSA and EC
computation supported by hardware is possible. No accessibility of the deselected cryptographic co-processors is
without impact on any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the situation where the user
decides just not to use the cryptographic co-processors.
End of note.




1
    For the case the TOE comes without RSA and/or EC library, the TOE provides basic HW-related routines for RSA and/or EC calculations.
      For a secure library implementation the user has to implement additional countermeasures himself.

7.1.4.1        Preface regarding Security Level related to Cryptography
Implemented cryptography, regardless whether proprietary or following public standards is subject of ageing
due to the evolution and progress of technology, mathematics and analysis methods. For that reason,
guarantees for the absence of exploitable properties cannot be given - by anybody. But, the risk for the absence
of such properties is severely reduced if the implementation is based on a long time published and publicly
discussed standard algorithm.
If the vendor implements a proprietary algorithm, then the BSI analyses this algorithm in the course and time
frame of the certification process. It is obvious that this local, one party and short timed analysis cannot replace a
long time publicly discussed standard algorithm. Possible risk mitigation, if not an industrial secret, is the
publication of the proprietary standard and starting the public discussion. This transparency could provide on
one hand some mitigation of risk; on the other hand, the algorithm is then directly a valuable analyst target. In
that case, also no one can say, when such publication is sufficiently discussed; and again guarantees for the life
time being in the field can no one give.
As of today, using public standards is often not possible due to compromises with regard to acceptable
computing time and available energy. For that reason it is up to the user to decide. The SFR claims assign
whether an algorithm or proprietary or following a standard or implementing a standard with deviations.

The BSI states that the strength of the cryptographic algorithms is not rated in the course of the product
certification (see [25] Section 9, Para.4, Clause 2). But cryptographic functionalities with a security level of lower
than 100 bits can no longer be regarded as secure without considering the application context. Therefore, for
these functions it shall be checked whether the related cryptographic operations are appropriate for the
intended system. The assignment to the 100 Bit level by BSI can be read in the certification report issued by BSI.
Some further hints and guidelines can be derived from the Technische Richtlinie BSI TR-02102,
www.bsi.bund.de.

Notes for FCS_COP.1/TDES:

   1.   The proprietary BLD and Recrypt operation modes are described in the hardware reference manual HRM [1] while
        the implementations of the other modes follow the referenced standards. Also the BLD is compliant to the
        referenced standards but is operated in a masked way. The proprietary modes offer increased protection against
        failure and side channel analysis.
   2.   Using the TDES algorithm with three keys of which two keys equal is a so called two key triple DES operation. This
        operation can be configured and managed by the user but does not meet the national requirements issued by BSI
        and achieves therefore not the 100 Bits security level.

Notes for FCS_CKM.1.1/RSA-1 or FCS_CKM.1.1/RSA-2:
1. The function CryptoGeneratePrime has been assigned to the appropriate security level by BSI. The proprietary
CryptoGeneratePrimeMask function has not been cryptographic-analytically evaluated and certified by BSI.
End of note.

2. The minimum key length follows the national recommendations by the BSI which means that RSA key lengths
below 1976 bits are not included in the certificate. The key length requirements can differ between the countries.
Please note that the BSI expects this key length as appropriate until 2022 and recommends for longer usage
times key lengths of 3000 bits or higher.

3. For easy integration of RSA functions into the user’s operating system and/or application, the library contains
single cryptographic functions respectively primitives which are compliant to the standard. The primitives are
referenced above. Therefore, the library supports the user to develop an application representing the standard if

 7.1.4.5.3     General Preface regarding Elliptic Curve Cryptography
The EC library is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software. The security functional
requirement covers the standard Brainpool [19] and NIST [26] Elliptic Curves with key lengths of 160, 163, 192,
224, 233, 256, 283, 320, 384, 409, 512 or 521 bits. For one part the definition of the key lengths follows the
national AIS32 regulation regarding the 100 bit security level by the BSI. Numerous other curve types, being also
secure in terms of side channel attacks on this TOE, exist, which the user optionally can add in the composition
certification process.
All curves are based on finite field GF(p) with value p є [241-1; 2521[ as well as curves based on a finite field GF(2n)
with size n є [41-1; 521] are supported.

7.1.6          Application Note to FPT_FLS.1 Failure with preservation of secure state
The SFR FPT_FLS.1 is defined in the PP [9] but with application note 14 it is required to describe the secure state:
Where ever FPT_FLS.1 is claimed it depends on the source or affected piece of data the failure was detected.
Induced failures on other than memory contents could in the worse lead to exploitable situations if not
discovered and treated properly. This includes i.e. internal transported keys and other TSF data. For that reasons
the integrity of the transport ways and also the modules the TSF and critical data are used is protected against
failure.
Depending on the criticality where the failure occurred and in most cases a security reset is triggered. Only in
case of a peripheral bus error or an address translation mismatch, a user software action is required as described
in the user guidance.
In case of a security reset, the user cannot take any action. The chip immediately stops operation and reboots.


7.2            Support by the Flash Loader

The TOE provides the Flash Loader to download user data into the SOLID FLASH™ NVM, either during
production of the TOE or at customer site. The Flash Loader is dedicated for usage by authorized users only in
secured and insecure environment during the production up to Phase 6 Security IC Personalisation.
The Flash Loader has to be permanently deactivated before entering Phase 7 Security IC end-usage.
For this reason the TOE shall meet the requirements as defined and described in the PP [9] section 7.3 Packages
for Loader and 7.2 Package Authentication of the Security IC:
     Limited capabilities (FMT_LIM.1/Loader),
     Limited availability – Loader (FMT_LIM.2/Loader),
     Authentication Proof of Identity (FIA_API.1),
     Inter-TSF trusted channel (FTP_ITC.1),
     Basic data exchange confidentiality (FDP_UCT.1),
     Data exchange integrity (FDP_UIT.1),
     Subset access control – Loader (FDP_ACC.1/Loader) and
     Security attribute based access control – Loader (FDP_ACF.1/Loader)
as defined in the PP [9], section 7.2 and 7.3.

The Flash Loader supports the following security function policy (SFP):
    Loader SFP:
        provides the mutual authentication between the TOE and the administrator user or download operator
        user and the download of the user data into the memory of the TOE.

The Flash Loader supports the following two subjects:
    Administrator user:
        is enabled performing mutual authentication with the keys Kc and Kd, to manage (set, exchange, delete)
        the keys Kc, Kd and Kfdi and to process the download of the user data into the memory of the TOE.
    Download operator user:
        is enabled performing mutual authentication with Kd, to exchange the key Kd and to perform the
        download of the user data into the memory of the TOE. He can also delete Kfdi.

       Dependencies:        FDP_ACF.1 Security attribute based access control.
 FDP_ACC.1.1/Loader         The TSF shall enforce the Loader SFP on
                               (1) the subjects Administrator user and the Download operator user,
                               (2) the objects User data in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM memory of the TOE,
                               (3) the operation deployment of the Loader.

Additional requirement to the environment with regard to GBIC: If the GBIC process is to be applied, the keys Kc,
Kd and Kfdi shall be generated with sufficient entropy considering the requirements by GBIC as outlined in
section 10 to prove the identity of the TOE to an external entity.

The TOE shall meet the requirement “Limited availability – Loader (FTP_ACF.1/Loader)” as specified below:

7.3.1           Refinements
Some refinements are taken unchanged from the PP [9]. In some cases a clarification is necessary. In Table 17 an
overview is given where the refinement is done.
The refinements from the PP [9] have to be discussed here in the Security Target, as the assurance level is
increased. The refinements from the PP [9] are included in the chosen assurance level EAL 6 augmented with
ALC_FLR.1.
7.3.1.1         Development (ADV)
ADV_IMP Implementation Representation:
The refined assurance package ADV_IMP.1 implementation representation of the TSF requires the availability of
the entire implementation representation, a mapping of the design description to the implementation
representation with a level of detail that the TSF can be generated without further design decisions. In addition,
the correspondence of design description and implementation representation shall be demonstrated.
The covered higher assurance package ADV_IMP.2 requires a complete and not curtailed mapping of the
implementation representation of the TSF, and the mapping of the design description to the entire
implementation representation. In addition, the correspondence of design description and the implementation
representation shall be demonstrated. The ADV_IMP.1 aspect and refinement remains therefore valid. The
enhancement underlines the refinement in the PP [9] and by that the entirely complete design i.e. not curtailed
representation with according mapping was provided, demonstrated and reviewed.

ADV_FSP Functional Specification:
The ADV_FSP.4 package requires a functional description of the TSFIs and there assignment to SFR-enforcing,
SFR-supporting, SFR-non-interfering, including related error messages, the assurance package. The
enhancement of ADV_FSP.5 requires additionally a complete semi-formal functional specification with
additional error information. In addition the package includes a tracing from the functional specification to the
SFRs, as well as the TSFIs descriptions including error messages not resulting from an invocation of a TSFI.
These aspects from ADV_FSP.5 are independent from the ADV_FSP.4 refinements from the PP [9] but
constitute an enhancement of it. By that the aspects of ADV_FSP.4 and its refinement in the PP [9] apply also
here. The assurance and evidence was provided accordingly.

ADV_SPM Formal Security Policy Model
It is the objective of this family to provide additional assurance from the development of a formal security policy
model of the TSF, and establishing a correspondence between the functional specification and this security
policy model. Preserving internal consistency the security policy model is expected to formally establish the
security principles from its characteristics by means of a mathematical proof.

Note:
All HSL versions implement tearing save behavior for the SOLID Flash™ NVM. Its features are close to physical
SOLID Flash™ NVM behavior which is not part of the SPM. Therefore, the HSL functionality contributing to
FPT_FLS:1, FPT_PHP.3 and FDP_SDI.2 is excluded from the SPM even though it contributes to the named SFRs
which are listed and modelled in the ADV_SPM.1.1D definition.

Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)


7.3.1.2        Life-cycle Support (ALC)
ALC_CMS Configuration Management Scope:
The refinement of ALC_CMS.4 in the PP [9] defines with some conditions the possibility that the Security IC
embedded firmware can be part of the delivered TOE. This is the case as the Security IC embedded firmware –
regardless of the version in use - and the optional software are part of TOE and delivered together with the TOE
as the firmware and optional software are stored in the ROM and/or SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The presence of the
optional parts belongs to the user order. Both, the firmware and software delivered with the TOE are controlled
entirely by Infineon Technologies.
In addition, the TOE offers the possibility that the user can download his software at his own premises. These
parts of the software are user controlled only and are not part of this TOE. The download of this solely user
controlled software into the SOLID FLASH™ NVM is protected by strong authentication means. In addition, the
download itself could also be encrypted.
The requirements by ALC_CMS.4 are fulfilled including the refinements from the PP [9].
The ALC_CMS.5 implements the additional requirement to include development tools and related information
into the configuration list. This add on has no influence on the refinement of ALC_CMS.4 in the PP [9] as the
delivery of Security IC embedded firmware is independent from the TOE development tools and related
information. The package ALC_CMS.5 is therefore an enhancement to ACL_CMS.4 and the package with its
refinement in the PP [9] remains valid. The assurance and evidence was provided accordingly.

ALC_CMC Configuration Management Capabilities:
The PP refinement from the assurance package ALC_CMC.4 Production support, acceptance procedures and
automation points out that the configuration items comprise all items defined under ALC_CMS to be tracked
under configuration management. In addition a production control system is required guaranteeing the
traceability and completeness of different charges and lots. Also the number of wafers, dies and chips must be
tracked by this system as well as procedures applied for managing wafers, dies or complete chips being removed
from the production process in order to verify and to control predefined quality standards and production
parameters. It has to be controlled that these wafers, dies or assembled devices are returned to the same
production stage from which they are taken or they have to be securely stored or destroyed otherwise.
The additionally covered extended package of ALC_CMC.5 Advance Support requires advanced support
considering the automatisms configuration management systems, acceptance and documentation procedures
of changes, role separation with regard to functional roles of personnel, automatisms for tracking and version
controlling in those systems, and includes also production control systems. The additional aspects of
ADV_CMC.5 constitute an enhancement of ACL_CMC.4 and therefore the aspects and ACL_CMC.4 refinements
in the PP [9] remain valid. The assurance and evidence was provided.

ALC_DVS Development Security:
The requirement ALC_DVS.2 is refined in the PP [9] requiring the development security documentation
comprising all the physical, procedural, personnel, and other security measures that are necessary to protect the
confidentiality and integrity of the TOE design and implementation in its development environment.
The documentation and evidence was given, reviewed, audited and thus the assurance and evidence was
provided accordingly.

Considering the GBIC requirements as outlined in section 10 this assurance class is refined with the confirmation
that the:
      keys are generated with sufficient entropy
      the keys are stored within a HSM as integral part of the vendor environment
      the keys are stored in the non-volatile memory of the chip
All these requirements were subject of an audit; assurance and evidence was provided.

ALC_DEL Delivery Procedure:
Considering the GBIC requirements as outlined in section 10 this assurance class is refined with the confirmation
that the delivery process of the Flash Loader keys - as referenced in the section 10 - is separated from the chip
delivery to the user.


7.3.1.3         Tests (ATE)
ATE_COV Test Coverage:
The PP refined assurance package ATE_COV.2 Analysis of coverage addresses the extent to which the TSF is
tested, and whether or not the testing is sufficiently extensive to demonstrate that the TSF operates as specified.
It includes the test documentation of the TSFIs in the functional specification. In particular the refinement
requires that The TOE must be tested under different operating conditions within the specified ranges. In
addition, the existence and effectiveness of mechanisms against physical attacks should be covered by evidence
that the TOE has the particular physical characteristics. This is furthermore detailed in the PP [9].
This assurance package ATE_COV.2 has been enhanced to ATE_COV.3 to cover the rigorous analysis of
coverage. This requires the presence of evidence that exhaustive testing on rigorous entirely all interfaces as
documented in the functional specification was conducted. By that ATE_COV.2 and refinements as given in the
PP [9] are enhanced by ATE_COV.3 and remain as well. The TSFIs were completely tested according to
ATE_COV.3 and the assurance and evidence was provided.


7.3.1.4         AVA_VAN Vulnerability Analysis
The assurance package AVA_VAN remains unchanged compared to the forerunner processes and requires
advanced methodical vulnerability analysis.

7.4           Security Requirements Rationale

7.4.1         Rationale for the Security Functional Requirements
The objectives O.Authentication and OE.TOE_Auth are discussed in the PP [9] chapter 7.2.1.
The objectives O.Cap_Avail_Loader and OE.Lim_Block_Loader and the covering security functional
requirements FMT_LIM.1/Loader and FMT_LIM.2/Loader are discussed in the PP [9] chapter 7.3.1.
The policy P.Ctrl_Loader and the objectives O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader and OE.Loader_usage are discussed in the PP
[9] chapter 7.3.2.

Additionally, the objective O.Add-Function includes the objectives implemented by the CIPURSE™
Cryptographic Library versions: O.Ctrl_Auth_CCL, O.Prot_Integrity and O.Prot_Confidentiality.
These extended objectives are discussed in this ST in chapter 5.5 P.Add functions.

The additional objectives O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality is defined in chapter 5.1 and 5.8 in this document.
PP [9] chapter 6.1 includes also the definition of FDP_SDI.2 „Stored data integrity monitoring and action“.
While the above mentioned security functional requirements rationale of the TOE are defined and described in
PP [9] section 6.3.1, the additional introduced SFRs are listed and discussed below:

Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)


For clarity please find following assignment to versions:
     ACL-1 covers version v2.08.007
     ACL-2 covers version v2.07.003
     ACL-3 covers version v2.06.003
     SCL-1 covers version v2.04.002
     SCL-2 covers version v2.02.010
     CCL covers version v02.00.0004


 7.4.1.1       Cryptographic Aspects
The justification related to the security objective “Additional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions)”
is as follows:
The security functional requirement(s) “Cryptographic operation (FCS_COP.1)” exactly require(s) those functions
to be implemented which are demanded by O.Add-Functions:
      The ACL library – regardless of the version chosen – implements the SFRs FCS_CKM.1/RSA, supporting
          the generation of RSA keys, and the FCS_CKM.1/EC, supporting the generation of EC keys, needed for
          these cryptographic operations.
          To sum up, the ACL versions implement the SFRs as follows:
              o FCS_COP.1/RSA-1, FCS_COP.1/ECDSA-1, FCS_COP.1/ECDH-1, FCS_CKM.1/RSA-1, and
                  FCS_CKM/EC-1 respectively
              o FCS_COP.1/RSA-2, FCS_COP.1/ECDSA-2, FCS_COP.1/ECDH-2, FCS_CKM.1/RSA-2, and
                  FCS_CKM/EC-2 respectively
              o FCS_COP.1/RSA-3, FCS_COP.1/ECDSA-3, FCS_COP.1/ECDH-3, FCS_CKM.1/RSA-3, and
                  FCS_CKM/EC-3
      The SCL library of version v2.04.002 implements the function of cipher based message authentication
          code CMAC, supporting the authenticity and integrity of data blocks for example used for messages.
      The CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library implements the SFRs FCS_COP.1/CCL Cryptographic Operation
          CCL Trusted Channel, establishing the trusted channel between two authenticated entities and
          FCS_CKM.1/CCL Cryptographic key generation, supporting the generation of the keys used for
          authentication and confidentiality. The CIPURSE™ CL operation requires the presence of the SCP.

The implementation covers the functional requirements and meets the objective O.Add-Functions.
The use of the supporting library Toolbox has no impact on any security functional requirement nor does the use
generate additional requirements. The Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

All these requirements have to be fulfilled to support OE.Resp-Appl for the SFRs implemented by the:
      SCP:
             o FCS_COP.1/TDES
             o FCS_COP.1/AES
      SCL for version v2.04.002:
             o FCS_COP.1/TDES-SCL-1
             o FCS_COP.1/AES-SCL-1
             o FCS_COP.1/CMAC-SCL-1
      SCL for version v2.02.010:
             o FCS_COP.1/TDES-SCL-2
             o FCS_COP.1/AES-SCL-2
      CCL for version v02.00.0004:

              o   FCS_CKM.4/CCL Cryptographic key destruction

Nevertheless, the developer of the Smartcard Embedded Software must ensure that the additional functions are
used as specified and that the User data of the Composite TOE processed by these functions are protected as
defined for the application context. These issues are addressed by the specific security functional requirements:
     [FDP_ITC.1 Import of user data of the Composite TOE without security attributes or
        FDP_ITC.2 Import of user data of the Composite TOE with security attributes or
        FCS_CKM.1 Cryptographic key generation],
     FCS_CKM.4 Cryptographic key destruction

The security functional requirements required to meet the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing,
    O.Malfunction, O.Phys-Manipulation and O.Leak-Forced define how to implement the specific security
functionality. However, key-dependent functions could be implemented in the Smartcard Embedded Software.

The usage of cryptographic algorithms requires the use of appropriate keys. Otherwise these cryptographic
functions do not provide security. The keys have to be unique with a very high probability, and must have a
certain cryptographic strength etc. In case of a key import into the TOE (which is usually after TOE delivery) it
has to be ensured that quality and confidentiality are maintained. Keys for DES and AES are provided by the
environment. Keys for RSA and EC algorithms can be provided either by the TOE or the environment.

The justification of the security objective and the additional requirements (both for the TOE and its environment)
show that they do not contradict to the rationale already given in the Protection Profile for the assumptions,
policy and threats defined there.

Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)


 7.4.1.2       Hardware related Aspects
The security functional component Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2) has been newly created (Common
Criteria Part 2 extended). This component allows that particular parts of the security mechanisms and functions
provided by the TOE can be tested after TOE Delivery. This security functional component is used instead of the
functional component FPT_TST.1 from Common Criteria Part 2. For the user it is important to know which
security functions or mechanisms can be tested. The functional component FPT_TST.1 does not mandate to
explicitly specify the security functions being tested. In addition, FPT_TST.1 requires verification of the integrity
of TSF data and stored TSF executable code which might violate the security policy.
The tested security enforcing functions are SF_DPM Device Phase Management, SF_CS Cryptographic Support
and SF_PMA Protection against modifying attacks.

The justification related to the security objective “Protection against Physical Manipulation (O.Phys-
Manipulation)” is as follows:
The security functional requirement FPT_TST.2 will detect attempts to conduce a physical manipulation on the
monitoring functions of the TOE. The objective of FPT_TST.2 is O.Phys-Manipulation. The physical manipulation
will be tried to overcome security enforcing functions.

The security functional requirement “Subset access control (FDP_ACC.1)” with the related Security Function
Policy (SFP) “Memory Access Control Policy” exactly require the implementation of an area based memory
access control as required by O.Mem-Access. The related TOE security functional requirements FDP_ACC.1,
FDP_ACF.1, FMT_MSA.3, FMT_MSA.1 and FMT_SMF.1 cover this security objective. The implementation of
these functional requirements is represented by the dedicated privilege level concept.

The justification of the security objective and the additional requirements show that they do not contradict to
the rationale already given in the Protection Profile for the assumptions, policy and threats defined there.
Moreover, these additional security functional requirements cover the requirements by the PP [9] user data of
the Composite TOE protection of chapter 1.2.5 claim 35 and 36 which are not refined by the PP [9].
Nevertheless, the developer of the Smartcard Embedded Software must ensure that the additional functions are
used as specified and that the User data of the Composite TOE processed by these functions are protected as
defined for the application context. The TOE only provides the tool to implement the policy defined in the
context of the application.

The justification related to the security objective Protection against Malfunction due to Environmental Stress
(O.Malfunction) is as follows:
The security functional requirement Stored data integrity monitoring and action (FDP_SDI.2) requires the
implementation of an integrity observation and correction which is implemented by the Error Detection (EDC)
and Error Correction (ECC) measures. The EDC is present throughout all memories of the TOE while the ECC is
realized in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. These measures detect and inform about one and more bit errors. In case
of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM 1 bit errors of the data are corrected automatically. The ECC mechanism protects
the TOE from the use of corrupt data. Therefore FDP_SDI.2 is suitable to meet the security objective
O.Malfunction.

The presence of true random numbers is the security goal 4 (SG4) which is formalized in the objective O.RND
Random Numbers. This objective must be covered by fulfillment of the security functional requirement
FCS_RNG. This is defined in the PP [9] chapter 5.1. The requirement implements a quality metric which is defined
by national regulations. The implemented random number generation fulfils the definitions of AIS 31 [13] in the
quality classes as outlined in chapter 7.1.1.1. Therefore the SFR FCS_RNG and the objective O.RND are covered.

 7.4.1.3       Flash Loader related Aspects
The justification related to the Flash Loader security objectives are as follows. Note that the following objectives
and related rationales apply only at TOE products coming with activated Flash Loader enabled for software or
data download by the user. In other cases the Flash Loader is not available anymore and the user data download
is completed. Depending on the capabilities of the user software these security functional requirements may
then reoccur as subject of the composite TOE.
The Flash Loader related objectives are:

The objective O.Authentication requires the presence of an authentication mechanism proving the identity of a
given security IC to an external entity. This objective is covered by the functional requirement FIA_API
Authentication Proof of Identity. The Flash Loader implements this functionality and outputs identification data
to external requesting entity. The user guidance describes in more detail how this authentication request is
applied and conducted by the external entity. As the functional requirements are met by the Flash Loader the
objective is covered.

The objective O.Cap_Avail_Loader requires limited capabilities of the Loader functionality and irreversible
termination of the Loader. First, this is covered by the functional requirement FMT_LIM.1/Loader which
implements protection against data manipulation and disclosure by unauthorized users after permanent
deactivation of the Flash Loader. Second, the functional requirement FMT_LIM.2/Loader limits the Flash Loader
availability after the download has been finished by the user. The Flash Loader provides a final locking command
which irreversibly terminates the Flash Loader availability. This command execution must be applied after user
has finalized his download. As the functional requirements are met by the Flash Loader the objective is covered.

The objectives O.Ctrl_Auth_Loader and O.Prot_TSF_Confidentiality require that a trusted communication
channel with an authorized user, a confidentiality protection during the download and authentication of the user
data and access control for the usage of the Loader functionality are provided by the Loader.
Without successfully passing the authentication functionality of the Flash Loader no usage of the Flash Loader is
possible. Passing the authentication successfully assigns also a user role to the current user.
The Flash Loader implements mutual authentication functionality and if successfully passing this mutual
authentication, the TOE and the external user are established as trusted entities. Furthermore, the Flash Loader
enforces the exchange of the download key by the user which provides clear separation from the hardware
vendor and preserves confidentiality of the user data download. In addition, the Flash Loader preserves the
integrity of the downloaded data against for example induced errors by hashing functionality.
As the functional requirements are met by the Flash Loader the objective is covered.

Note regarding the Flash Loader:
The algorithm strength of the Flash Loader has not been cryptographic-analytically evaluated by the BSI, as
Infineon has implemented a proprietary extension.

Comment 1:
The dependency FMT_SMR.1 introduced by the two components FMT_MSA.1 and FMT_MSA.3 is considered to
be satisfied because the access control specified for the intended TOE is not role-based but enforced for each
subject. Therefore, there is no need to identify roles in form of a security functional requirement FMT_SMR.1.
End of comment.

Comment 2:
These requirements all address the appropriate management of cryptographic keys used by the specified
cryptographic function and are not part of the PP [9]. Most requirements concerning key management shall be
fulfilled by the environment since the Smartcard Embedded Software is designed for a specific application
context and uses the cryptographic functions provided by the TOE.
For the security functional requirements:
         SCP:
              o FCS_COP.1/TDES and
              o FCS_COP.1/AES
      SCL-1:
              o FCS_COP.1/TDES-SCL-1
              o FCS_COP.1/AES-SCL-1
              o FCS_COP.1/CMAC-SCL-1
      SCL-2:
              o FCS_COP.1/TDES-SCL-2
              o FCS_COP.1/AES-SCL-2
the respective dependencies FCS_CKM.1, FDP_ITC.1 or FDP_ITC.2 have to be fulfilled by the environment,
because the TOE does not provide the accompanying functionality; i.e. generate and import keys.
That means that the environment shall meet the requirements FCS_CKM.1, FDP_ITC.1 or FDP_ITC.2 as defined
in Common Criteria Part 2 [11], section 10.1 and 11.7.
The cryptographic key destruction can be done by overwriting the key register interfaces or by software reset of
the SCP which provides immediate zeroing of all SCP key registers. Please refer also to the application notes 41
and 42 in the PP [9].

For the security functional requirements:
     ACL-1:
            o FCS_COP.1/RSA-1
            o FCS_COP.1/ECDSA-1
            o FCS_COP.1/ECDH-1
     ACL-2:

            o FCS_COP.1/ECDH-2
     ACL-3:
            o FCS_COP.1/RSA-3
            o FCS_COP.1/ECDSA-3
            o FCS_COP.1/ECDH-3

and the respective dependency FCS_CKM.1 has to be fulfilled by the TOE with the security functional
requirements:
     FCS_CKM.1/RSA-1 for FCS_COP.1/RSA-1,
     FCS_CKM.1/RSA-2 for FCS_COP.1/RSA-2 and
     FCS_CKM.1/RSA-3 for FCS_COP.1/RSA-3
     FCS_CKM.1/EC-1 for FCS_COP.1/ECDSA-1,
     FCS_CKM.1/EC-2 for FCS_COP.1/ECDSA-2 and
     FCS_CKM.1/EC-3 for FCS_COP.1/ECDSA-3
     FCS_COP.1/ECDH-1,
     FCS_COP.1/ECDH-2 and
     FCS_COP.1/ECDH-3
     FCS_CKM.1/EC-1 for FCS_COP.1/ECDH-2
     FCS_CKM.1/EC-2 for FCS_COP.1/ECDH-2
     FCS_CKM.1/EC-3 for FCS_COP.1/ECDH-3
as defined in section 7.1.4.

The respective dependency FCS_CKM.4 has to be fulfilled by the environment because the TOE does not provide
the functionality to delete keys. That mean, that the environment shall meet the requirement FCS_CKM.4 as
defined in Common Criteria Part 2 [11], section 10.1.
Additionally, the requirement FCS_CKM.1 can be fulfilled by the environment as defined in Common Criteria
Part 2 [11], section 10.1.
For the security functional requirements
     FCS_CKM.1/RSA-1,
     FCS_CKM.1/RSA-2 and
     FCS_CKM.1/RSA-3
     FCS_CKM.1/EC-1,
     FCS_CKM.1/EC-2 and
     FCS_CKM.1/EC-3
the respective dependency FCS_COP.1/RSA-1, FCS_COP.1/RSA-2 and FCS_COP.1/RSA-3 is fulfilled by the TOE.
Again, the respective dependency FCS_CKM.4 has to be fulfilled by the environment because the TOE does not
provide this functionality. Therefore, the environment shall meet the requirement FCS_CKM.4 as defined in
Common Criteria Part 2 [11], section 10.1.

Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)



The cryptographic libraries RSA, EC and the Toolbox library are delivery options, regardless of the version
chosen. Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations of or even without these libraries. In the case of
coming without one or any combination of the cryptographic libraries RSA and EC, the TOE does not provide the
Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or Elliptic Curve
Cryptography (EC). The Toolbox is no cryptographic library and provides no additional specific security
functionality. The Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
The IT environment has to fulfill the requirements of this section depending if the TOE comes with or without
a/the library/ies.
End of comment.

Comment 3:
The inter-TSF trusted channel SFR FTP_ITC.1 has no dependency and is provided as main purpose by the Flash
Loader. The Flash Loader provides a distinct and independent communication channel with authenticated end
points and protection from modification or disclosure.
The dependency FMT_MSA.3 introduced by the component FDP_ACF.1/Loader is considered to be not required,
because the security attributes enforcing the Loader SFP are fixed by the IC manufacturer and no new objects
under the control of the Loader SFP are created. Claim 371 of PP [9] applies.
End of comment.

Comment 4:
The security of the cryptographic functions FCS_CKM.1/CCL, FCS_CKM.4/CCL and FCS_COP.1/CCL relies on the
secure use of the CIPURSE™ CL: This means that it is essential on user side that the common secret is generated
and stored in an appropriate way and that integrity and confidentiality of this user secret is maintained.
These preconditions are treated in the PP [9] section 3.1 claims 67 and 68.
The key destruction FCS_CKM.4/CCL applies only for the keys generated during and for a session and not for the
common secret.
End of comment.

the different assurance levels are shown as well as the augmentations. The augmentations are in compliance
with the Protection Profile [9].
An assurance level EAL6 with the augmentations ALC_FLR.1 is required for this type of TOE since it is intended
to defend against highly sophisticated attacks without protective environment over a targeted long life time.
Thereby, the TOE must withstand attackers with high attack potential, which is achieved by fulfilling the
assurance class AVA_VAN.5.
In order to provide a meaningful level of assurance and that the TOE provides an adequate level of defense
against such high potential attacks, the evaluators have access to all information regarding the TOE including
the TSF internals, the low level design and source code including the testing of the modular design. Additionally
the mandatory technical document “Application of Attack Potential to Smartcards” [14] shall be taken as a basis
for the vulnerability analysis of the TOE.
Due to the targeted long life time of the Infineon Technologies products, a comprehensive flaw remediation
process and database is in place to maintain the TOE also in future. Reported flaws of any kind, meaning,
regardless whether the flaws reported have a more directed towards quality, functional or security, are tracked
by a dedicated database and related processes.
And more, in order to continuously improve also future products reported flaws are analyzed whether they could
affect also future products. Due to its overall importance for future development, the assurance class ALC_FLR.1
is included in this certification process.
This evaluation assurance package was selected to permit a developer gaining maximum assurance from positive
security engineering based on good commercial practices as well as the assurance that the TOE is maintained
during its targeted life time. The evaluation assurance package follows the EAL6 assurance classes as given in
Common Criteria Part 3 [12].
7.4.2.1        ALC_FLR.1 Basic Flaw Remediation
Flaws of any kind are entered into a dedicated database with related processes to solve those.
At the point in time where a flaw is entered, it is automatically logged who entered a flaw and who is responsible
for solving it. In addition, it is also documented if, when and how an individual flaw has been solved.
Flaws are prioritized and assigned to a responsibility.
The assurance class ALC_FLR.1 has no dependencies.

8              TOE Summary Specification (ASE_TSS)
The product overview is given in section 2.1. In the following the Security Features are described and the relation
to the security functional requirements is shown.
The TOE is equipped with following Security Features to meet the security functional requirements:
     SF_DPM            Device Phase Management
     SF_PS             Protection against Snooping
     SF_PMA            Protection against Modification Attacks
     SF_PLA                     Protection against Logical Attacks
     SF_CS             Cryptographic Support
The following description of the Security Features is a complete representation of the TSF.


8.1            SF_DPM: Device Phase Management
The life cycle of the TOE is split-up in several phases: Chip development and production (covering phases 2, 3 and
4) and the final use (phase 4 to 7). This is a rough split-up from TOE point of view. These phases are implemented
in the TOE as test mode (phase 3) and user mode (phase 4-7).

In addition, chip identification modes are implemented being active in all TOE life cycle phases. The chip
identification data (O.Identification) is stored in a in the not changeable and access protected configuration page
area of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. In the same area further TOE configuration data is stored. In addition, user
initialization data can be stored in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM during the production phase as well. During this first
data programming, the TOE is still in the secure environment and in Test Mode.
The covered security functional requirement is FAU_SAS.1 “Audit storage”.

During start-up of the TOE the decision for one of the various operation modes is taken in dependency of the
corresponding phase identifiers. The decision of accessing a certain mode is defined as phase entry protection as
defined conditions have to be met. The phases follow also a defined and flow protected sequence. The sequence
of the phases is protected by means of authentication.
The covered security functional requirements are FMT_LIM.1”Limited Capabilities” and FMT_LIM.2 “Limited
availability”.

During the production phase (phase 3 and 4) or after the delivery to the user (phase 5 or phase 6), the TOE
provides the possibility to download and finalize the user data. Using the download functionality of the Flash
Loader requires passing a successful authentication process and a key exchange. The key exchange ensures that
only the user defines the encryption key which is used during the download. If the conditions are met, user code
and data can be flashed into the SOLID FLASH™ NVM area as specified by the associated control information of
the Flash Loader software. The download into the chip is done in an encrypted way only.
The usage of the Flash Loader is only possible after a successful mutual authentication process of the external
entity and the TOE itself.
In case the user has ordered TOE derivatives without Flash Loader, the software download by the user (phase 5
or phase 6) is disabled and all user data of the Composite TOE has been flashed on the TOE at Infineon premises.
In both cases the integrity of the loaded data is checked with a hashing process. The data to be loaded is
transferred always in encrypted form.
After finalizing the load operation and prior delivery to the end-user, the Flash Loader shall be permanently
deactivated. The permanent deactivation is named locking and is a user obligation documented in the user
guidance. This locking removes any possibility to use or reactivate the Flash Loader and provides a clear
separation between the firmware-domain – regardless of the version in use - and the user software domain
regarding downloads: Software updates after delivery to the end user are exclusively in the responsibility of the

These Flash Loader related security functional requirements apply only at TOE products coming with activated
Flash Loader enabled for user data download by the user. In other cases the Flash Loader is not available
anymore and the user data download is completed.

During operation within a selected life cycle phase the accesses to memories are granted by the MMU controlled
access rights and related privilege levels. The TOE operates always in a dedicated life cycle phase.
The covered security functional requirements are FDP_ACC.1 “Subset Access Control, FDP_ACF.1 “Security
Attribute based Access Control and FMT_MSA.1 “Management of Security Attributes.

In addition, during each start-up of the TOE the address ranges, belonging memory keys and access rights are
initialized by the BOS with predefined values. The covered security functional requirement is FMT_MSA.3 “Static
Attribute Initialization”.

The TOE clearly defines access rights and privilege levels in conjunction with the appropriate key management in
dependency of the firmware – regardless of the version in use - or software to be executed. By this clearly
defined management functions are implemented, enforced by the MMU, and the covered security functional
requirement is FMT_SMF.1 “Specification of Management Functions”.

During the testing phase in production within the secure environment the entire SOLID FLASH™ NVM is
deleted. The covered security functional requirement is FPT_PHP.3 “Resistance to physical attack”.
Each operation phase is protected by means of authentication and encryption. The covered security functional
requirements are FDP_ITT.1 “Basic internal Transfer Protection” and FPT_ITT.1 “Basic internal TSF Data Transfer
Protection”.

8.2             SF_PS: Protection against Snooping
Memories
All contents of all memories of the TOE are encrypted on chip to protect against data analysis on stored data as
well as on internally transmitted data. There is no plain data on the chip and the encryption of the memories
cover also the stored error detection values, and with regard to the SOLID FLASH™ NVM, also the error
correction values. Induced errors will lead with very high probability to an encryption and/or decryption fail in the
MED and to the appropriate action.
In contrast to the linear virtual address range, the physical SOLID FLASH™ NVM pages are transparently
mapped to different physical address ranges and controlled by the MMU. Thus the data is continuously
protected during transfer and storage by encryption and the mapping means of the address ranges. On top this,
the address scrambling provides a completely user transparent chip-individual physical memory layout of the
SOLID FLASH™ NVM. By that even in the unlike event of two equal TOE derivatives coming with equal software,
equal MMU settings and equal MMU mapping, finding an equal piece of data – for example a previously
identified target – at the equal physical location in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM on the second chip is extremely
unlikely and from attackers perspective not practical. This address scrambling is entirely independent from the
user software and the MMU.
MED
The encryption of the memories is performed by the MED with a proprietary cryptographic algorithm and with a
complex and dynamic key management providing protection against cryptographic analysis attacks. This
includes also the possibility of user chosen keys for SOLID FLASH™ NVM areas. The only key remaining static
over the product life cycle is the specific ROM key, changing in case of a mask change only. The few keys which
have to be stored on the chip, for example the user chosen key and the chip specific ROM key, are protected
against read out. Note that the ROM contains the firmware only and no user data of the Composite TOE.
The covered security functional requirements are FPT_PHP.3 “Resistance to physical attack”, FDP_IFC.1 “Subset
information flow control”, FPT_ITT.1 “Basic internal TSF data transfer protection”, FDP_ITT.1 “Basic internal
transfer protection”FPT_FLS.1, “Failure with preservation of secure state” and FDP_SDC.1 “Stored data
confidentiality”.
Peripheral Bus
In addition the data transferred over the memory bus to and from (bi-directional encryption) the CPU, Co-
processors, the special SFRs and selected peripheral devices connected to the peripheral bus are encrypted
automatically with a dynamic key change. All security relevant transfer of addresses or data via the peripheral
bus are dynamically masked and thus protected against readout and analysis. Induced errors effect either on the
bus protocols or the masked data which then will be discovered with high probability and with taking the
appropriate action.
The covered security functional requirements are FPT_PHP.3 “Resistance to physical attack”, FDP_IFC.1 “Subset
information flow control”, FPT_ITT.1 “Basic internal TSF data transfer protection”, FDP_ITT.1 “Basic internal
transfer protection and FPT_FLS.1 “Failure with preservation of secure state”.
CPU
The TOE computes and handles data even in the core only encrypted respectively masked. At no time plain data
is processed – except when communicating to the outer world. By this plain data is only available at the interface
modules. The dual CPU computes entirely masked and in addition dynamic mask changes are applied. Also the
register files are masked and at no time plain data is present.

information flow control”, FPT_ITT.1 “Basic internal TSF data transfer protection”, FDP_ITT.1 “Basic internal
transfer protection and FPT_FLS.1 “Failure with preservation of secure state”.
SCP/Cache
The symmetric cryptographic co-processor (SCP) is also entirely masked and also here the masks change
dynamically. The Cache being in ongoing use during core operation is also entirely and dynamically encrypted.
The encryption covers the data processing policy and FDP_IFC.1 “Subset information flow control“. The covered
security functional requirements are FPT_PHP.3, FDP_IFC.1, FPT_ITT.1 and FDP_ITT.1.
MMU
In addition to their protection during processing of code and data, their storage in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM is
protected with a further mean too: Even if users operate with direct and static addressing for storing their
secrets, the addresses are always translated to virtual addresses – if the address call is in the correct privilege
level which is monitored by the MMU. Addresses and privilege level must match and induced errors lead to
appropriate error message and action.
The covered security functional requirements are FPT_PHP.3 “Resistance to physical attacks”, FPT_ITT.1 “Basic
internal TSF data transfer protection”, FDP_ITT.1 “Basic internal transfer protection” and FPT_FLS.1 “Failure
with preservation of secure state”.
Proprietary CPU
A proprietary dual CPU implementation with a non-public bus protocol renders analysis very complicated and
time consuming. Besides the proprietary structures also the internal timing behavior is proprietary and by this
aggravating significantly the analysis in addition. Important parts of the chip are especially designed to counter
leakage or side channel attacks like DPA/SPA or EMA/DEMA. Therefore, even the physical data gaining is
difficult to perform, since timing and current consumption is almost independent of the dynamically encrypted,
respectively masked and/or randomized data.
Important parts of the chip are especially designed to counter leakage or side channel attacks like DPA/SPA or
EMA/DEMA. Therefore, even identifying and collecting physical data is difficult to perform, since timing and
current consumption are almost independent of the processed data, as those are protected by a bunch of other
internal protecting means.
Synthesis
In the design a number of components are automatically synthesized and mixed up to disguise and complicate
analysis. The covered security functional requirement is FPT_PHP.3 “Resistance to physical attack”.
Secure Wiring/I2 shield
A further protective design method used is secure wiring. All security critical wires have been identified and
protected by special routing measures against probing. Additionally, artificial shield lines are implemented and
mixed up with normal signal lines required for chip operation, rendering probing attacks with high feasibility to
not practical. This provides the so called intelligent implicit active shielding “I2-shield”.
The covered security functional requirements are FPT_PHP.3 “Resistance to physical attack”, FPT_ITT.1 “Basic
internal TSF data transfer protection” and FDP_ITT.1”Basic internal transfer protection”.
FSE
A low system frequency sensor FSE is implemented to prevent the TOE from single stepping.
The covered security functional requirements are FPT_PHP.3 “Resistance to physical attack” and FPT_FLS.1
“Failure with preservation of secure state”.

8.3            SF_PMA: Protection against Modifying Attacks
First of all we can say that all security mechanisms effective against snooping SF_PS apply also here since a
reasonable modification of data is almost impossible on dynamically encrypted, masked, scrambled,
transparently relocated, randomized and topologically protected hardware. Due to this the covered security
functional requirements are FPT_PHP.3, FDP_SDC.1, FDP_IFC.1, FPT_ITT.1, FDP_ITT.1 and FPT_FLS.1.

The TOE is equipped with an error detection code (EDC) which covers the memory system of RAM, ROM and
SOLID FLASH™ NVM and includes also the MED and MMU. Thus introduced failures could be detected and the
appropriate action is taken. In terms of single bit errors in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM, the errors are also
automatically corrected. This contributes to FDP_SDI.2 Stored data integrity monitoring and action and
FRU_FLT.2 Limited fault tolerance. In order to prevent accidental bit faults during production in the ROM an EDC
value is calculated and stored as well.
The error detection and partly correction means protect against physical and provide the appropriate reaction in
terms of induced errors and faults. The covered security functional requirements are FRU_FLT.2 Limited fault
tolerance, FPT_PHP.3 Resistance to physical attack, and FDP_SDI.2 Stored data integrity monitoring and action.

The Cache integrity is protected by a different method as the other memories and provides also error detection
and appropriate reaction in case of induced errors. This contributes to FDP_SDI.2 Stored data integrity
monitoring and action.

The TOE is protected against fault and modifying attacks. The core provides the functionality of double-
computing and result comparison of all tasks to detect incorrect calculations. The detection of an incorrect
calculation is stored and the TOE enters a defined secure state which causes the chip internal reset process.
The implementation of the dual CPU computing on the same data is by this one of the most important security
features of this platform. As also the results of both CPU parts are compared at the end, a fault induction of
modifying attacks would have to be done on both CPU parts at the correct place with the correct timing – despite
all other countermeasures like dynamic masking, encryption and others. The comparison and the register files
are also protected by various measures. The covered security functional requirements are FPT_FLS.1 Failure with
preservation of secure state, FPT_PHP.3 Resistance to physical attack, FPT_ITT.1 Basic internal TSF data transfer
protection and FDP_ITT.1 Basic internal transfer protection.

During start up, the BOS performs various configurations and subsystem tests. After the BOS has finished, the
operating system or application can call the RMS function User Mode Security Life Control (UMSLC) test. This
function provides the testing of the security features enabled to generate an alarm and can be released actively
by the user software during normal chip operation any time. Attempts to modify the security features will be
detected from this test and lead to the appropriate reaction. The covered security functional requirement is
FPT_TST.2 Subset TOE security testing.

In the case that a physical manipulation or a physical probing attack is detected, for example by the intelligent
intrinsic shield (I2), the processing of the TOE is immediately stopped and the TOE enters a secure state called

security reset. The I2 shield is also part of the UmSLC. The covered security functional requirements are Failure
with preservation of secure state, FPT_FLS.1 Failure with preservation of secure state, FPT_PHP.3 Resistance to
physical attack and FPT_TST.2 Subset TOE security testing.

As physical effects or manipulative attacks may also address the program flow of the user software, a watchdog
timer and a check point register are implemented. These features allow the user to check the correct processing
time and the integrity of the program flow of the user software.
Another measure against modifying and perturbation respectively differential fault attacks (DFA) is the
implementation of backward calculation in the SCP. By this induced errors are discovered.
The covered security functional requirements are FPT_FLS.1 Failure with preservation of secure state, FDP_IFC.1
Subset information flow control, FPT_ITT.1 Basic internal TSF data transfer protection, FDP_ITT.1 Basic internal
transfer protection and FPT_PHP.3 Resistance to physical attack.

All communication via the busses is in addition protected by a monitored hardware handshake. If the handshake
was not successful an alarm is generated.
The covered security functional requirements are FPT_FLS.1 Failure with preservation of secure stateand
FPT_PHP.3 Resistance to physical attack.

The virtual memory system and privilege level model are enforced by the MMU. This controls the access rights
throughout the TOE. There is a clear differentiation within the defined privilege levels. Addresses and privilege
level must match and induced errors and/or manipulation lead to appropriate error message and action. The
covered security functional requirements are FDP_ACC.1 Subset access control, FDP_ACF.1 Security attribute
based access control, FMT_MSA.1 Management of security attributes, FMT_MSA.3 Static attribute initialization
and FMT_SMF.1 Specification of Management Functions. The virtual memory system controlled by the MMU is
an additional protection against manipulation and the privilege level based access control are also contributions
to FDP_SDC.1 Stored data confidentiality.

All the measures of controlling the access rights, checking the integrity of data and code, the coverage of the
integrity protecting values by means of encryption, the continuously masked calculation and operation stands
for the Integrity Guard. The implemented measures interact like a gearing mechanism and by that an induced
error will be discovered with very high feasibility followed by the appropriate reaction. While single bit faults may
be corrected automatically, other faults which cannot be corrected lead to an alarm, and in case of security
critical detections a security alarm and reset is generated. The covered security functional requirement is
FPT_FLS.1 Failure with preservation of secure state.

If the hardware support library HSL – in all versions – comes with the TOE and the Low Level Driver (LLD) and/or
the In-Place-Update (IPU) functionality are used in certain configurations as outlined in the version specific user
guidance document HSL [15], the TOE behavior is protected against sudden power off events and its behavior is
tearing safe. Induced faults will be both detected and repaired, or the system enters a secure state. This
protection is additionally claimed for the IWR method as offered in the version 03.12.8812 and 03.11.8339.
This means in detail that the SFRs Failure with preservation of secure state FPT_FLS.1 and FPT_PHP.3
Resistance to physical attack as well as FDP_SDI.2 Stored data integrity and action are covered for the methods
LLD and IPU for the HSL versions 02.01.6634 and 01.22.4346 if the user follows the recommendation and
configuration of the user guidance.
In addition, the equal SFRs Failure with preservation of secure state, Resistance to physical attacks and Stored
data integrity and action, FPT_FLS.1, FPT_PHP.3 and FDP_SDI.2 are claimed for versions 03.12.8812 and
03.11.8339. These versions claim the named SFR for the methods LLD, IPU and also IWR if the user follows the
recommendation and configuration of the user guidance.
In all versions, tearing safe implements an atomicity in the concerned operations, resulting that if the process of
writing to the SOLID FLASH™ NVM is interrupted by an accidental or intentional power loss or reset, the SOLID
FLASH™ NVM data will be either the original data or will be in the new data. The interruption possibly involves
some recovery steps that have to be taken before the data is accessed. After successful completion of the

processing a secure state is entered.
The covered security functional requirements are FPT_FLS.1 Failure with preservation of secure state,
FPT_PHP.3 Resistance to physical attack and FDP_SDI.2 Stored data integrity and action.

If the NRG Software comes with the TOE its behavior is protected against sudden power off events and tearing
safe. The implemented tearing safe behavior is an additional do-not-need-to-care-about-service for the user.
However, the NRG is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).

8.4            SF_PLA: Protection against Logical Attacks
The memory access control of the TOE uses a memory management unit (MMU) to control the access to the
available physical memory by using virtual memory addresses and to segregate the code and data to a privilege
level model. The MMU controls the address permissions of up to seven privileged levels and gives the software
the possibility to define different access rights for the user available privileged levels. The address permissions of
the privilege levels are controlled by the MMU. In case of an access violation the MMU will trigger a reset and
then a trap service routine can react on the access violation. The policy of setting up the MMU and specifying the
memory ranges for the privilege levels – with the exception of the IFX level – is defined from the user software
(OS). The privilege levels 0, 1 and 2 are reserved for TOE internal operations. The privilege levels 3 and 4 are
reserved for operation systems and the privilege levels 5, 6 and 7 are reserved for applications.
Therefore, the TOE provides support for secure separation of memory areas covering the security functional
requirements FPT_PHP.3 “Resistance to physical attack”, FDP_ACC.1 “Subset access control”, FDP_ACF.1
“Security attribute based access control”, FMT_MSA.1 “Management of security attributes”, FMT_MSA.3 “Static
attribute initialization” and FMT_SMF.1 “Specification of Management functions”.

The TOE provides the possibility to protect the property rights of user code and data by the encryption of the
SOLID FLASH™ NVM areas with a specific key defined by the user. Due to this key management FDP_ACF.1 is
fulfilled. In addition, each memory present on the TOE is encrypted using either mask specific or chip individual
or even session keys, assigned by a complex key management. Induced errors are recognized by the Integrity
Guard concept and lead to an alarm with high feasibility. In case of security critical errors a security alarm is
generated and the TOE ends up in a secure state. The covered security functional requirements are FPT_PHP.3

8.5            SF_CS: Cryptographic Support
The TOE is equipped with several hardware accelerators and software modules to support the standard
symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic operations. This security function is introduced to include the
cryptographic operation in the scope of the evaluation as the cryptographic function respectively mathematic
algorithm itself is not used from the TOE security policy. On the other hand these functions are of special interest
for the use of the hardware as platform for the software. The components are a cryptographic co-processor
supporting the DES and AES algorithms and a combination of a co-processor and software library modules to
support RSA cryptography, RSA key generation, ECDSA signature generation and verification, ECDH key
agreement and EC public key calculation and public key testing.
Note that the additional function of the EC library, ECC_ADD providing the primitive elliptic curve operations,
does not add specific security functionality and that the according user guidance abbreviates the Elliptic Curve
cryptographic functions with ECC.

Note 17:
The symmetric cryptographic library SCL in two alternative versions is a delivery option. Therefore the TOE may
come with or without one of the SCLs. In the case of coming without any of the alternative SCLs, the TOE does
not provide the related AES and TDES security functional requirements. The equal case applies if the symmetric
cryptographic coprocessor is blocked. Then neither the SCL versions nor the SCP implement the related AES and
TDES security functional requirements. The SCL requires the presence of the SCP.
End of note.

Note 18:
Not used. Kept for consistency.

Note 19:
The cryptographic libraries RSA, EC and the Toolbox library are delivery options, regardless of the version
chosen. Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations of or even without these libraries. In the case of
coming without one or any combination of the cryptographic libraries RSA and EC, the TOE does not provide the

Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or Elliptic Curve
Cryptography (EC). The Toolbox Library is no cryptographic library, provides no additional specific security
functionality and thus the Toolbox library is not part of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
End of note.

Note 20:
This TOE can come with both crypto co-processors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked
Crypto2304T, or with both crypto co-processors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior
to the production of the hardware. In case the SCP is blocked, no AES and DES computation supported by
hardware is possible. In case the Crypto2304T is blocked, no RSA and EC computation supported by hardware is
possible. No accessibility of the deselected cryptographic co-processors is without impact on any other security
policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the situation where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic
co-processors.
End of note.

Note 21:
The presence of the alternative cryptographic library CIPURSE™ CL is a delivery option.
Therefore the TOE may come with free combinations with the other libraries of or without these libraries.
In the case of coming without the CIPURSE™ CL the TOE does not provide the specific security functionality
implemented by this software.

8.5.5             Toolbox Library for all versions
The Toolbox provides the following basic long integer arithmetic and modular functions in software, supported
by the cryptographic coprocessor: Addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, comparison, reduction,
modular addition, modular subtraction, modular multiplication, modular inversion and modular exponentiation.
No security relevant policy, mechanism or function is supported. The Toolbox library is deemed for software
developers as support for simplified implementation of long integer and modular arithmetic operations.
The Toolbox does not cover security functional requirements and thus the Toolbox library is not part of the TOE
Security Functionality (TSF).

8.5.6          CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library
The order option CIPURSE™ Cryptographic Library (CCL) provides cryptographic functionality to implement a
CIPURSE™ V2 conformant protocol [35-1].
This protocol provides a secure mutual authentication of two entities, namely the terminal (denoted as PCD =
Proximity Coupling Device (CIPURSE™-compliant terminal)) and a smart card or a token in other form factors
which is called PICC. PICC stands for Proximity Integrated Circuit Card (CIPURSE™-compliant card).
Beside the mutual authentication, the protocol implements cryptographic measures to maintain the integrity of
the transferred data and preserves in parallel the confidentiality of the transferred data.

The CIPURSE™ CL covers the following cryptographic security functional requirements as follows:
CCL in version v02.00.0004
    FCS_CKM.1/CCLCryptographic key generation,
    FCS_CKM.4/CCLCryptographic key destruction – AES
    FCS_COP.1/CCLCryptographic Operation – CCL Trusted Channel

                     The implemented cryptographic operation applies following standards:
       Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 197 [31]
       NIST Special Publication SP 800-38A [21]
       CIPURSE™ V2 Cryptographic Protocol [35-1] chapter 5.2 Session key Derivation
       CIPURSE™ V2 Cryptographic Protocol [35-1] chapter 6.2 Key Derivation for the first frame
       CIPURSE™ V2 Cryptographic Protocol [35-1] chapter 6.3 Integrity Protection
       CIPURSE™ V2 Cryptographic Protocol [35-1] chapter 6.4 Confidential Communication


8.5.7          Hybrid PTRNG
Random data is essential for cryptography as well as for security mechanisms. The TOE is equipped with a Hybrid
Physical True Random Number Generator (HPTRNG, FCS_RNG.1). The random data can be used from the
Smartcard Embedded Software and is also used from the security features of the TOE, i.e. masking. The
HPTRNG implements various topological means, masked bus interface and is self-checking.
The produced genuine random numbers are available as a security service for the user and are also used for
internal purposes. Together with the security guidelines in [6] the hybrid PTRNG operates in the following modes
of operation and is conformant to the named classes:
     True Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.2
     Hybrid Random Number Generation, meeting AIS31 PTG.3
     Deterministic Random Number Generation (DRNG) AIS31 DRG.3
     Key Stream Generation (KSG), stream cipher generation AIS31 DRG.2

The details of AIS31 are given in [13].

The Hybrid PTRNG implements protected a protected peripheral bus interface is a synthesized module and
covers therefore FPT_PHP.3 “Resistance to physical attack”. The transferred random data are masked as well as
other configuration data transferred over the peripheral bus. This covers FDP_ITT.1 “Basic internal transfer
protection” and FPT_ITT.1 “Basic internal TSF data transfer protection”. The correct function of the Hybrid
PTRNG is subject of internal self-testing and in case of errors a secure state is achieved to protect the user from
random data with bad entropy. Therefore, the output of the Hybrid PTRNG is conformant to the above claimed
classes or there is no random data output. This covers FPT_FLS.1 “Failure with preservation of secure state”.

8.6        Assignment of Security Functional Requirements to TOE’s Security
Functionality
The justification and overview of the mapping between security functional requirements (SFR) and the TOE’s
security functionality (SF) is given in sections the sections above. The results are shown in Table 20. The security
functional requirements are addressed by at least one relating security feature.
The various functional requirements are often covered manifold. As described above the requirements ensure
that the TOE is checked for correct operating conditions and if a not correctable failure occurs that a stored
secure state is achieved, accompanied by data integrity monitoring and actions to maintain the integrity
although failures occurred. An overview is given in the table below.

TOE Summary Specification (ASE_TSS)


8.7            Security Requirements are internally Consistent
For this chapter the PP [9] section 6.3.4 can be applied completely.
In addition to the discussion in section 6.3 of PP [9] the security functional requirement FCS_COP.1 is introduced.
The security functional requirements required to meet the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing,
O.Malfunction, O.Phys-Manipulation and O.Leak-Forced also protect the cryptographic algorithms
implemented according to the security functional requirement FCS_COP.1. Therefore, these security functional
requirements support the secure implementation and operation of FCS_COP.1.
As disturbing, manipulating during or forcing the results of the test checking the security functions after TOE
delivery, this security functional requirement FPT_TST.2 has to be protected. An attacker could aim to switch off
or disturb certain sensors or filters and preserve the detection of his manipulation by blocking the correct
operation of FPT_TST.2. The security functional requirements required to meet the security objectives O.Leak-
Inherent, O.Phys-Probing, O.Malfunction, O.Phys-Manipulation and O.Leak-Forced also protect the security
functional requirement FPT_TST.2. Therefore, the related security functional requirements support the secure
implementation and operation of FPT_TST.2.
The requirement FPT_TST.2 allows testing of some security mechanisms by the Smartcard Embedded Software
after delivery. In addition, the TOE provides an automated continuous user transparent testing of certain
functions.
The implemented privilege level concept represents the area based memory access protection enforced by the
MMU. As an attacker could attempt to manipulate the privilege level definition as defined and present in the
TOE, the functional requirement FDP_ACC.1 and the related other requirements have to be protected
themselves. The security functional requirements required to meet the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent,
O.Phys-Probing, O.Malfunction, O.Phys-Manipulation and O.Leak-Forced also protect the area based memory
access control function implemented according to the security functional requirement described in the security
functional requirement FDP_ACC.1 with reference to the Memory Access Control Policy and details given in
FDP_ACF.1. Therefore, those security functional requirements support the secure implementation and operation
of FDP_ACF.1 with its dependent security functional requirements.
The requirement FDP_SDI.2 enables for detection of integrity errors of data stored in memory and for the
correction of one bit errors and/or taking further action. This meets the security objective O.Malfunction. The
requirements FRU_FLT.2, FPT_FLS.1, and FDP_ACC.1 which also meet this objective are independent from
FDP_SDI.2 since they deal with the observation of the correct operation of the TOE and not with the memory
content directly.

Common Criteria v3.1 - EAL6 augmented / EAL6+
Annex: Consideration of additional Requirements by the GBIC Approval Scheme)



 10            Annex: Consideration of additional Requirements by the GBIC
               Approval Scheme)
After an alignment and harmonization phase between BSI and the German Banking Industry Committee (GBIC)1
in 2014/2015, the Common Criteria certificates are accepted also by GBIC, if the certification process considers
additional specific process requirements. These additional GBIC requirements are defined in the GBIC document
[33] chapter 7 (in German language only) which are considered in the following.

Translation:
1. The hardware vendor has to support confidentiality and integrity protected processes that
    a. Generate keys with sufficient entropy
    b. Store those keys in a HSM within the vendor environment
    c. Store those keys in the non-volatile memory of the chip
    d. Deliver these keys separated from the chip delivery to the user
2. The loading of software and data into the chip memories is only possible after passing a secure
    authentication
These security requirements are especially affective for the security functionality of the key Kchip respectively Kc
coming from the personalization concept of the Publishing Houses (Verlage). For the complete coverage
following the Common Criteria requirements it is essential that already the firmware of the TOE provides the
security functionality for Kchip.
In the course of migration to Common Criteria these security requirements must be modelled in the Security
Target.
End of translation.

Regarding requirement 1:
GBIC issues therewith an additional requirement for sufficient entropy of the used keys. This requires the
presence of a dedicated device and process in order to provide evidence that the keys used have been generated
appropriately. The keys used in this context are generated by a dedicated hardware security module (HSM)
operated in FIPS mode according to the FIPS 140-2 standard with a DRGB according to NIST SP 800-90A. This
covers requirement 1.a as well as the security standards from GBIC.
The requirement 1.b is sufficiently addressed by the refinements regarding development security (ALC_DVS)
taken from PP [9].
All data loaded into the chip is encrypted and integrity protected stored in the SOLID FLASH ™ NVM. This covers
the requirement 1.c.
The requirement 1.d implies the presence of a dedicated GBIC process with additional protection means for the
key handling and management after its generation in the HSM. Infineon Technologies has implemented a
dedicated process with role separation, access protection, transport protection during the internal different
instances and implements a separate specific process for protected delivery of the used keys to the user.
Therefore, the requirement 1.d. is sufficiently addressed by refinements regarding delivery procedure (ALC_DEL)
if the security functionality of the corresponding key is part of the TOE.
On request at Infineon Technologies, the user can receive under NDA information about the flow implemented
with the document “DK-SECCOSv7 Flow for Kchip Injection by Infineon, Customer Information” in version 1.0,
2017-09-26.

Regarding requirement 2:
This requirement implements the authentication aspects of the chip against the external world and vice versa,
which is covered by following packages taken from the PP [9]:

       FIA_API “Authentication of the Security IC“,
       “Package 2: Loader dedicated for usage by authorized users only” and additionally the TOE implements
        the
       “Package 1: Loader dedicated for usage in secured environment only” of the PP [9].
                  The rational shows that all GBIC specific requirements are met by the TOE.

Note for the additional objectives for GBIC respectively DK
 The requirement for sufficient entropy requires the presence of dedicated device and process in order to
  provide evidence that the key Kchip has been generated appropriately. As the key Kchip is generated by a
  dedicated hardware security module (HSM) with appropriate certification this requirement is fulfilled.
 The used HSM is operted in the FIPS mode according to the FIPS 140-2 standard with a DRGB according to
  the NIST SP 800-90A standard. Therewith the security standards as required by GBIC are met.
 The additional requirements imply the presence of a dedicated GBIC process with additional protection
  means for the key handling and management after its generation in the HSM. Infineon Technologies has
  implemented a dedicated process with role separation, access protection, transport protection during the
  internal different instances and implements a separate specific process for protected delivery of the key Kchip
  to the user.
 The GBIC requirement 2 is covered by the flash loader package 1 of PP [9] as justified in section 5.3.

Additional requirements issued by the general GBIC directive in September 2016
The related directive with file number 80-11 affects the software vendors respectively personalization step and
implements specific requirements. The rational is given by the fact that it can occur that an exclusively contact
based product, deemed for LCCS of MF for SECCOS ICC and ICC products referring to SECCOS 7, is based on a
dual interface controller. Since not all contact-based-only applications block the access to the contactless
interface, specific requirements are set immediately effective.
These requirements affect user software developers and the product personalization only and thus they are not
repeated here.
Anyhow, the given requirements target the complete disabling of the contactless interfaces if the product is used
contact based only and define the specific configuration of the LCCS-Byte of the MF with the hexadecimal value
“35” for those contact based products, referring on SECCOS ICC and ICC products for SECCOS 7.
When using this TOE, the user can easily follow these requirements since this dual interface controller can
permanently block the contactless interface by user applicable configuration means. And, in addition, dedicated
product derivatives are available by order option coming with the contact based interface only.
