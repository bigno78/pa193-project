      Chapter 2.2.4 describes briefly the contents of the individual documents of the User Guidance Documentation, while
the individual documents are versioned and entitled in chapter 9 literature and references. The listed set of user
guidance documents belongs to the TOE.


The TOE can be identified with the Generic Chip Identification Mode (GCIM). The GCIM outputs a chip identifier byte,
design step, firmware identifier version and further configuration information. The identification data and configuration
details are described in the confidential Security Target [39] and in the Family Hardware Reference Manual [6].


1.2      Remarks to the Target of Evaluation (TOE)

This TOE is represented by various products, differentiated by various configuration possibilities and order options.
Despite these configuration possibilities, all products are derived from the equal hardware design results, the M7892 B11.
The GCIM mode is explained and detailed in the user guidance document hardware reference manual HRM [6].

All product derivatives are identical in module design, basic layout and footprint, but are adapted to connect to different
types of antennas or to a contact based interface only. Therefore, the TOE is represented and made out of five different
mask sets with following TOE internal and security irrelevant differences:
The main difference between the mask sets of the TOE is to implement different input capacitances in the analogue part
of the radio frequency interface (RFI). One of the input capacitances is zero and marks a derivative deemed for contact
based communication only. This differentiation in the input capacitances allows the connection to a wider range of
various antenna types, or respectively, to a contact based interface only. Note that external antennas or interfaces are
not part of the TOE. The derivatives without available input capacitance are deemed for contact based communication
only.
A further additional mask set takes one of the previous mask sets and adds an additional mask on top of the very last
mask of the TOE. This last mask is deemed to produce a metal layer, just rerouting the pads for a special package type.
This additional top metal layer is comparable to an outer package, which would simply reconnect the TOE pads in a
different way. This last rerouting layer does not change the function of the TOE itself and is, in addition, subject of the
design requirements of the users. This last layer is flexible in design, naming and is of course, not relevant for the security
of the TOE. It is comparable to the scenario where someone takes a piece of wire and reconnects the pads of a smartcard
in a different way.
For logistical reasons and due to user demands the TOE products produced with this mask set output a different design
step C1x, where “x” represents a number from 1 up to 9. The number depends on the design variants of the additional
top metal layer and of the package, which can be customer specific.
To each of the capacitances related mask sets, an individual value is assigned, which is part of the data output of the
Generic Chip Identification Mode (GCIM). This number is located in the GCIM and allows clearly differentiating between
the mask sets related to the different input capacitances. In addition users can identify derivatives produced with the
additional top metal layer by the design step output “C1x” as described above. On those “C1x” derivatives the GCIM
remains unchanged and allows the identification of which of the other mask sets was used to produce the TOE with the
additional top metal layer. Therefore, the GCIM design step output - C11 up to C19 - of this extra top metal layer TOE
products correspond always to the TOE silicon design step B11. Thereby, the clear identification of the silicon design step
is given.
There are no other differences between the mask sets the TOE is produced with. Details are explained in the user
guidance hardware reference manual HRM [6] and in the errata sheet [15].
The M7892 B11 product allows for a maximum of configuration possibilities following the market needs. For example, a
                                                                                                             1
M7892 B11 product can come in one project with the fully available SOLID FLASH™ NVM or in another project with any
other SOLID FLASH™ NVM -size below the physical implementation size, or with a different RAM size. And more, the user
has the free choice, whether he needs the symmetric coprocessor SCP, or the asymmetric coprocessor Crypto@2304T, or
both, or none of them. In addition, the user decides, whether the TOE comes with a free combination of software libraries

or without any. And, to be even more flexible, various interface options can be chosen as well. To sum up the major
selections, the user defines by his order:
           The available memory sizes of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM and RAM.
            Note that there is no user available ROM on the TOE.
           The availability of the cryptographic coprocessors.
           The user has the free choice for combinations of optional cryptographic libraries. The TOE can be delivered with
            either v1.02.013 or v2.07.003 (or none) of these libraries, but it is not possible to combine different versions
            within the TOE.
           The availability of the Flash Loader for available interfaces like ISO-7816, contactless ISO-14443.
           The availability of various interface options.
           The possibility to tailor the product by blocking on his own premises.
           The degree of freedom of the chip configuration is predefined by Infineon Technologies AG and made available
            via the order tool.
Beside fix TOE configurations, which can be ordered as usual, this TOE implements optionally the so called Bill-Per-Use
(BPU) ability. This solution enables our customer to tailor the product on his own to the required configuration – project
by project. By that BPU allows for significant reduction of logistic cost at all participating parties and serves for
acceleration of delivery of tailored product to the end-user.
The blocking information can be modified by the users applying specific APDUs. Once final locking is done, further
modifications are disabled.
The BPU software part is only present on predefined products, which have been ordered with the BPU option. In all other
cases this software is not present on the product. More details can be obtained in the confidential Security Target [39].
In addition, after strong and successful authentication, the Flash Loader firmware part allows the download of user
software, or just parts of it, to the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. By this the user is free to decide:
           whether Infineon downloads (flashes) the user software entirely during the TOE production phase,
           or if this is done by the user himself after Infineon has delivered the TOE without user software,
           or Infineon downloaded only parts of the user software and the user completes his software at his own
            premises.
If Infineon is required to download the user software or parts of it, the user is of course required to provide Infineon the
code deemed for the download, prior production of the TOE. This user software transfer to Infineon is done by a secure
channel, of course being also part of this certificate.
Therefore, the user is entirely flexible in his process, regardless whether he intends to flash his code entirely on his own,
or sends his complete code or just parts of it to Infineon for high parallel flashing during production. After the flashing
steps have been completed, the Flash Loader firmware is permanently deactivated. A reactivation is then no more
possible.
Beside all configuration possibilities, it is self-evident that of course, exclusively all security relevant settings are contained
in the IFX-only part. The Flash Loader BPU software does not access and has no access to the IFX-only part.

Once the user blocking by applying the APDU has been finalized, the configuration page is no more accessible for changes.
After the final deactivation of the Flash Loader the product is permanently fixed regarding its configurations and
software. A reactivation of the Flash Loader is not possible. At the next start-up, the STS apply the settings, and, if called,
a RMS-function can output the finally made chip configuration for verification and information purposes.
The entire configuration storage area is protected against manipulation, perturbation and false access. Note that the IFX-
only part of the configuration page is already access protected prior delivery to the user and the TOE leaves the Infineon
Technology premises only locked into User Mode.
Beside the various TOE configurations further possibilities of how the user inputs his software on the TOE, i.e. the
operating system and applications, are in place. This provides a maximum of flexibility and for the entire process of how
users keep and manage their data. An overview is given in the following table:

For the cases with Flash Loader on board and whenever the user has finalized his SW-download, respectively the TOE is in
the final state and about to be delivered to the end-user, the user is obligated to lock the Flash Loader. The final locking of
the FL results in a permanent deactivation of the Flash Loader. This means that once being in the locked status, the Flash
Loader cannot be reactivated anymore.
The following listing contains a selection of configuration possibilities. More information is given in the confidential
Security Target [39]. Note that within those limitations the TOE configurations can vary under only one equal IC-hardware
and one development code – the M7892 B11 – and without impact on security.
Note also that following configuration possibilities are valid unchanged throughout all different mask sets.

often used memory pages, together with the means for error detection and correction serves at least for equal or even
higher reliability and endurance, compared to a dedicated ROM.
Beside the above listed flexible ranges, the user guidance contains a number of predefined configurations for those
customers not making use of the BPU option. All of these configurations belong to the TOE as well and are of course
made of the equal hardware and are inside the above declared ranges.
Today’s predefined configurations of the TOE are listed in the hardware reference manual [6]. These predefined products
come with the most requested configurations and allow to produce volumes on stock in order to simplify logistic
processes.
According to the BPU option, a not limited number of configurations of the TOE may occur in the field. The number of
various configurations depends on the user and purchase contract only.
Note that the TOE answers to the Non-ISO-ATR with the Generic Chip Identification Mode (GCIM) answer. This GCIM
outputs a coded clear identifier for the type of the GCIM, the platform identifier, the design step and further
configuration information. The hardware reference manual [6], being part of the user guidance, enables then for the clear
interpretation of the read out GCIM data.
These GCIM data enable the user for clear identification of the TOE and also of one of the different mask sets and
therewith for checking the validity of the certificate.
In addition, a dedicated RMS function allows reading out the present configuration in detail. Again, together with
hardware reference manual [6], this allows for clear identification of a product and its configuration.
All these steps for gathering identification and detailed configuration information can be done by the user himself,
without involving Infineon Technologies AG.
The TOE consists of the hardware part, the firmware parts and the optional software parts.
The firmware parts are the RMS library, the Service Algorithm Minimal (SAM), the STS firmware for test purpose (see
chapter 2.2.2), providing some functionality via an API to the Smartcard Embedded Software, the Flash Loader for
                                                                                                        1
downloading user software to the SOLID FLASH™ NVM and the NRG software interface. The firmware is located in the
ROM and the belonging patches are stored in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The ROM contains no user data.
The software parts are differentiated into:

The cryptographic libraries RSA , EC SHA-2 , and the symmetric cryptographic library (SCL), as well as the supporting
libraries Toolbox and Base.
The TOE can be delivered including - in free combinations - or not including any of the functionality of the cryptographic
libraries EC, RSA, SHA-2, SCL and the supporting Toolbox library. The Base library is used internally by the RSA, the EC and

the Toolbox library, thus if one of the aforementioned libraries is ordered, the Base library will be automatically included
in the delivery.
If the user decides not to use one or all of the crypto library(s), the specific library(s) is (are) not delivered to the user and
the accompanying “Additional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions)” Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and/ or EC
and/or SHA-2 and SCL based Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and/or SCL based Triple Data Encryption Standard
(TDES) is/are not provided by the TOE.
The Toolbox library provides the user optionally basic arithmetic and modular arithmetic operations, in order to support
user software development using long integer operations. These basic arithmetic operations do not provide any security
functionality, implement no security mechanism, and do not proved additional specific security functionality - as defined
for the cryptographic libraries.
The user developed software using the Toolbox basic operations is not part of the TOE.
Deselecting one of the libraries does not include the code implementing functionality, which the user decided not to use.
Not including the code of the deselected functionality has no impact of any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly
equivalent to the situation where the user decides just not to use the functionality.
The SCL, RSA, EC, SHA-2, Base and Toolbox libraries can be loaded, together with the Smartcard Embedded software, into
the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The Smartcard Embedded Software, i.e. the operating system and applications are not part of
the TOE and thus not subject of the evaluation.


1.3      Target of Evaluation Overview

The TOE comprises the Infineon Technologies AG Dual Interface Security Controller M7892 B11 with specific IC dedicated
firmware and optional SCL, RSA, EC, SHA-2, Base and Toolbox libraries.
The TOE is a member of the Infineon Technologies AG high security controller family SLE70 meeting the highest
requirements in terms of performance and security. A summary product description is given in this Security Target Lite
(ST).
The SLE70 family provides a common architecture upon which specific products can be tailored for markets ranging from
basic security applications (SLE76) up to high security and contactless applications (SLE78).
The TOE is intended to be used in any applications and devices with highest security requirements. For example in smart
cards and also in other applications, such as secure element in various devices. This new product family features a
progressive security philosophy focusing on data integrity. By that three main principles combined in close synergy are
utilized in the new security concept called the “Integrity Guard”. The Integrity Guard implements the main principles full
error detection, full encryption and intelligent active shielding.
With these capabilities this TOE can be used almost everywhere, where highly secure applications are in use and of
course in any other application as well. This TOE is deemed for governmental, corporate, transport and payment markets,
or wherever a secure root of trust is required. Various types of applications can use this TOE, for example in closed loop
logical access controls, physical access controls, secure internet access control and internet authentication, or as multi-
application token or simply as encrypted storage.

This dual interface controller is able to communicate using either the contact based or the contactless interface. The
implemented dual interface provides a maximum flexibility in using following communication protocols: ISO 7816-3, ISO
14443 Type A and Type B, ISO/IEC 18092 NFC passive mode, NRG software Interface as well as further communication
modes, allowing also the implementation of user defined concepts for contact based or contactless communication.
More details are given in the confidential Security Target [39] and the hardware reference manual [6].
In order to increase the contactless interface performance even more, the RFI can be configured in terms of baud rates
for reception and transmission and the setting of the sub-carrier frequency used for the load modulation. More details

Further details and options are described in the confidential Security Target [39].
The TOE provides a real 16-bit CPU-architecture. The major components of the core system are the two CPUs (Central
Processing Units), the MMU (Memory Management Unit) and MED (Memory Encryption/Decryption Unit). The two CPUs
control each other in order to detect faults and serve by this for data integrity. The TOE implements a full 16 MByte linear
addressable memory space for each privilege level, a simple scalable Memory Management concept and a scalable stack
size. The flexible memory concept consists of ROM- and Flash-memory as part of the non-volatile memory (NVM),
respectively SOLID FLASH™ NVM. For the SOLID FLASH™ NVM the Unified Channel Programming (UCP) memory
technology is used.
The RMS library providing some functionality via an API to the Smartcard Embedded Software contains for example SOLID
FLASH™ NVM service routines. The Service Algorithm provides functionality for the tearing save write into the SOLID
FLASH™ NVM. The STS firmware is used for test purposes during start-up and the Flash Loader allows downloading user
software to the SOLID FLASH™ NVM during the manufacturing process. The firmware parts are implemented in the ROM
and in access protected areas of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The BSI has changed names and abbreviations for Random
Number Generators, which is clarified as follows: The Physical True Random Number Generator (PTRNG), also named
True Random Number Generator (TRNG) is a physical random number generator and meets the requirements of the
functionality class AIS31 PTG.2, see [5]. It is used for provision of random number generation as a security service to the
user and for internal purposes. The produced genuine random numbers can be used directly or as seed for the
Deterministic Random Number Generator (DRNG), former named as Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG). The
DRNG respectively PRNG is not in the scope of the evaluation. The TRNG respectively PTRNG is specially designed for
smart cards, but can also be used in any other application where excellent physical random data are required.

The two cryptographic coprocessors serve the need of modern cryptography: The symmetric coprocessor (SCP) combines
both AES and Triple-DES with dual-key or triple-key hardware acceleration. The Asymmetric Crypto Coprocessor, called
Crypto@2304T in the following, is optimized for RSA-2048 bit (4096-bit with CRT) and Elliptic Curve (EC) cryptography.
The software part of the TOE consists of the cryptographic RSA-, EC-, SCL and the SHA-2 libraries and the supporting
Toolbox and Base libraries. The Base library is used internally by the RSA, the EC and the Toolbox library, thus if one of the
aforementioned libraries is ordered, the Base library will be automatically included in the delivery. The Base library does
not provide any additional specific security functionality.
The RSA library is used to provide a high level interface to RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman) cryptography implemented on
the hardware component Crypto@2304T and includes countermeasures against SPA, DPA and DFA attacks. The routines
are used for the RSA keys generation (only in v2.07.003), RSA signature verification, the RSA signature generation and the
RSA modulus recalculation. The hardware Crypto@2304T unit provides the basic long number calculations (add, subtract,
multiply, square with 1100 bit numbers) with high performance. The RSA library is delivered as object code and in this
way integrated in the user software. The RSA library can perform RSA operations from 512 to 4096 bits.
                        1
Following the BSI recommendations, key lengths below 1976 bit are not included in the certificate.
The EC library is used to provide a high level interface to Elliptic Curve cryptography implemented on the hardware
component Crypto@2304T and includes countermeasures against SPA, DPA and DFA attacks. The routines are used for
ECDSA signature generation, ECDSA signature verification, ECDSA key generation and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key
agreement. In addition, the EC library provides an additional function for calculating primitive elliptic curve operations
                                                                                                   n
like EC Add and EC Double. EC curves over prime field Fp, as well as over GF(2 ) finite field are supported too.
The EC library is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software. The certification covers the
standard NIST [17] and Brainpool [18] Elliptic Curves with key lengths as defined in the SFRs. Note that there are further
uncounted side-channel-secure curve types which the user can optionally add in the composition certification process.
The SHA-library provides the calculation of a hash value of freely chosen data input in the CPU. The SHA-library is
delivered as object code and is in this way available for the user software.
This secure hash-algorithm SHA-2 is intended to be used for signature generation, verification and generic data integrity
checks. The use for keyed hash operations like HMAC or similar security critical operations involving keys, is not subject of
this TOE and requires specific security improvements and DPA analysis including the operating system, which is not part
of this TOE. Further essential information about the usage is given in the confidential user guidance [11].
The toolbox library does not provide cryptographic support or additional security functionality as it provides only the
following basic long integer arithmetic and modular functions in software, supported by the cryptographic coprocessor:
Addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, comparison, reduction, modular addition, modular subtraction, modular
multiplication, modular inversion and modular exponentiation. No security relevant policy, mechanism or function is
supported. The toolbox library is deemed for software developers as support for simplified implementation of long
integer and modular arithmetic operations.

The SCL Library offers a high-level interface for performing symmetric cryptography algorithms using SCP coprocessor.
The SCL has implemented block repetitions, dummy calculations, backward calculation rounds and known-answer test
security functions using 128, 192 and 256 AES algorithm, and TDES or DES algorithms. The SCL also supports ECB, CBC,
CTR, CFB and PCBC block cipher modes, however the PCBC mode is not a part of this evaluation. The SCL provides public
API [10] containing cipher block management functions (Cipher*), block cipher mode encryption/decryption functions
(BCM*), cipher block instantiation helper functions CipAlg_*_Sec1 and CipAlg_*_Sec2, however the CipAlg_*_Sec1
functions are not a part of this evaluation.
Note that this TOE can come with both cryptographic coprocessors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked
Crypto@2304T, or with both cryptographic coprocessors blocked. The blocking depends on the user’s choice. No
accessibility of the deselected cryptographic coprocessors is without impact on any other security policy of the TOE; it is
exactly equivalent to the situation where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic coprocessors.
If the Crypto@2304T is blocked the user will not be able to use the functionality of the EC, the RSA and the Toolbox
library, as these optional software libraries perform their basic arithmetic operations of the asymmetric cryptographic
coprocessor. If the SCP is blocked the user will not be able to use the hardware based AES and TDES calculations and
furthermore he will not be able to use the functionality of the SCL, as this optional software library is based on the
symmetric cryptographic coprocessor.
The TOE can be also delivered without a specific optional software library. In this case the TOE does not provide the
additional specific security functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) or/and Elliptic Curve Cryptography
(EC) or/and SHA-2 or/and SCL based Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or/and SCL based Triple Data Encryption
Standard (TDES).
To fulfill the highest security standards for smartcards today and also in the future, this TOE implements a progressive
digital security concept, which already has been certified in various forerunner processes. Thereby, this TOE utilizes digital
security features to include customer friendly security, combined with a robust design overcoming the disadvantages on
analogue protection technologies. The TOE provides full on-chip encryption covering the complete core, busses,
memories and cryptographic coprocessors leaving no plaintext on the chip. Therefore the attractiveness for attackers is
extremely reduced as encrypted signals are of no use for the attacker – neither for manipulation nor for eavesdropping.
In addition, the TOE is equipped with a full error detection capability for the complete data path. The dual CPU approach
allows error detection even while processing. A comparator detects whether a calculation was performed without errors.
This approach does not leave any parts of the circuitry unprotected. The concept allows that the relevant attack scenarios
are detected, whereas other conditions that would not lead to an error would mainly be ignored. And more, the TOE is
equipped with signal protection implemented by an Infineon-specific shielding combined with secure wiring and shielding
of security critical signals.
In the confidential Security Target [39] the TOE is described and a summary specification is given. The security
environment of the TOE during its different phases of the lifecycle is defined. The assets are identified which have to be
protected through the security policy. The threats against these assets are described. The security objectives and the
security policy are defined, as well as the security requirements. These security requirements are built up of the security
functional requirements as part of the security policy and the security assurance requirements. These are the steps during

2         Target of Evaluation Description

The TOE description helps to understand the specific security environment and the security policy. In this context the
assets, threats, security objectives and security functional requirements can be employed. The following is a more
detailed description of the TOE than in the Protection Profile [1] as it belongs to the specific TOE.


2.1      TOE Definition

This TOE consists of Security Dual Interface Controllers as integrated circuits, meeting the highest requirements in terms
of performance and security. They are manufactured by Infineon Technologies AG in a 90 nm CMOS-technology (L90).
This TOE is intended to be used in smart cards for particularly security-relevant applications and for its previous use as
developing platform for smart card operating systems according to the lifecycle model from the Protection Profile [1].
The term Smartcard Embedded Software is used in the following for all operating systems and applications stored and
executed on the TOE regardless whether it is a smartcard or another application of form factor. The TOE is the platform
for the Smartcard Embedded Software. The Smartcard Embedded Software itself is not part of the TOE.
The TOE consists of a core system, memories, coprocessors, peripherals, security modules and analogue peripherals.

The major components of the core system are the dual CPU (Central Processing Units) including the internal encryption
leaving no plain data anywhere, the MMU (Memory Management Unit), the MED (Memory Encryption/Decryption Unit)
and the CACHE memory.
The CPU – here the two processor parts (CPU1 and CPU2) are seen from functional perspective as one - is compatible with
the instruction set of the forerunner family 66-PE. Anyhow, the dual-CPU is faster than the standard processor at the
equal clock frequency. It provides additional powerful instructions for smart card or other applications. It thus meets the
requirements for the new generation of operating systems. Despite its compatibility the CPU implementation is entirely
proprietary and not standard.
The two processor parts of the CPU control each other in order to detect faults and maintain by this the data integrity. A
comparator detects whether a calculation was performed without errors and allows error detection even while
processing. Therefore the TOE is equipped with a comprehensive error detection capability, which is designed to leave no
relevant parts of the circuitry unprotected.
The CPU accesses the memory via the integrated Memory Encryption and Decryption unit (MED), which transfer the data
from the memory encryption schema to the CPU encryption schema without decrypting into intermediate plain data. The
error detection unit (EDU) automatically manages the error detection of the individual memories and detects incorrect
transfer of data between the memories by means of error code comparison.
The access rights of the firmware, user operating system and application to the memories are controlled and enforced by
the memory management unit (MMU).
The CACHE memory – or simply, the CACHE – is a high-speed memory-buffer located between the CPU and the (external)
main memories holding a copy of some of the memory contents to enable access to the copy, which is considerably faster
than retrieving the information from the main memory. In addition to its fast access speed, the CACHE also consumes less
power than the main memories. All CACHE systems own their usefulness to the principle of locality, meaning that
programs are inclined to utilize a particular section of the address space for their processing over a short period of time.
By including most or all of such a specific area in the CACHE, system performance can be dramatically enhanced. The
implemented post failure detection identifies and manages errors if appeared during storage.
The controllers of this TOE store both code and data in a linear 16-MByte memory space, allowing direct access without
the need to swap memory segments in and out of memory using a memory management unit.
The memory block contains the ROM, RAM and the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. All data of the memory block is encrypted and
all memory types are equipped with an error detection code (EDC), the SOLID FLASH™ NVM in addition with an error
correction code (ECC). Errors in the memories are automatically detected (EDC) and in terms of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM
certain errors are also corrected (ECC). The TOE uses also Special Function Registers SFR. These SFR registers are used for
general purposes and chip configuration. These registers are located in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM as configuration area
page.
The non-volatile ROM contains the firmware parts and is accessible for Infineon only, while the RAM is a volatile memory
and used by the core.
The coprocessor block contains the two coprocessors for cryptographic operations are implemented on the TOE: The
Crypto2304T for calculation of asymmetric algorithms like RSA and Elliptic Curve (EC) and the Symmetric Cryptographic

Processor (SCP) for dual-key or triple-key triple-DES and AES calculations. These coprocessors are especially designed for
smart card applications with respect to the security and power consumption, but can of course be used in any other
application of form factor where suitable. The SCP module computes the complete DES algorithm within a few clock
cycles and is especially designed to counter attacks like DPA, EMA and DFA.
Note that this TOE can come with both crypto coprocessors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked
Crypto2304T, or with both crypto coprocessors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior to the
production of the hardware. If the SCP is blocked the user will neither be able to use the solely hardware based AES and
TDES calculations of the TOE nor the SCL based AES and TDES calculations. If the Crypto@2304T is blocked the user will
not be able to use the services of the optional RSA, EC and Toolbox libraries. No accessibility of the deselected
cryptographic co-processors is without impact on any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the
situation where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic coprocessors.
The security peripherals block contains the small remaining set of sensors and filters. This small set of sensors is left in
order to detect excessive deviations from the specified operational range, while not being over-sensitive. These features
do not need adjustment or calibration and makes the chip even more robust. Conditions that would not be harmful for
the operation would in most cases not influence the proper function. The small set of sensors is not necessary for the chip
security but serve for robustness. Having the integrity guard concept in place, the sensors - except a single one - are no
more required for the TOE security. The only sensor left, contributing to a security mechanism, is the frequency sensor.
All other sensors are assigned to be security supporting only.
The filters are on board to make the TOE more robust against perturbations on the supply lines.
The block control is constituted out of the modules Interrupt Controller (ITP) and Peripheral Event Channel controller
(PEC), the modules supplying clock (ICO) and Power Management / Voltage regulator, the Interface Management Module
combined with the UmSLC. The UmSLC enables for checking the proper functions of modules and subsystems and checks
the correct operation of the TOE.
The implemented clock management is optimized to reduce the overall power consumption. Contactless products
provide a low-power halt mode for operation with reduced power consumption. The Clock Unit (CLKU) supplies the clocks
for all components of the TOE. The Clock Unit can work in an internal and external clock mode. The system frequency can
be configured and this enables a programmer to choose the best-fitting frequency for an application in consideration of a
potential current limit and a demanded application performance. More details are given in the confidential Security
Target [39] and in the hardware reference manual [6].
The peripherals block is constituted out of PTRNG, DRNG, CRC, Timer & WDT, the RFI and the UART. The modules are
briefly described in the following:
The TRNG respectively PTRNG is specially designed for smart cards, but can also be used in any other application where
excellent physical random data are required. The TRNG respectively PTRNG fulfills the requirements from the
functionality class PTG.2 of the AIS31 and produces genuine random numbers which then can be used directly or as seed
for the Deterministic Random Number Generator (DRNG), former named as Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG).
The DRNG respectively PRNG is not in the scope of the evaluation.

The cyclic redundancy check (CRC) module is a checksum generator. The checksum is a unique number associated with a
message or another block of data consisting of several bytes. The idea of the CRC method is to treat the input data as a
binary bit stream and divide that stream by a fixed binary number. The remainder of that division is the CRC checksum.
The timer enables for easy implementation of communication protocols such as T=1 and all other time-critical operations.
The timer can be programmed for particular applications, such as measuring the timing behavior of an event. Timer
events can generate interrupt requests to be used for peripheral event channel data transfers. The watchdog is
implemented to provide the user some additional control of the program flow. More details are given in the hardware
reference module HRM [6].

This dual interface controller is able to communicate using either the contact based or the contactless interface. The
implemented dual interface provides a maximum flexibility in using different communication protocols: ISO 7816, ISO
14443 Type A and Type B, ISO/IEC 18092 NFC passive mode, NRG software Interface, as well as further communication
modes, allowing also implementation of user defined concepts for contact based or contactless communication. The
flexibility of the communication interfaces enable for example also the use cases involving external analogue modems,
which are typically deemed for applications running in mobile devices. Please note that these external parts are of course
not part of this TOE. More details are given the confidential Security Target [39] and the hardware reference manual [6].
Supporting a NRG software Interface application requires a dedicated small space of memory. In this context and
depending on user’s choice, various memory sections of 1 up to 4 kByte each can be defined. The number and location of
these memory sections is simply limited by the available SOLID FLASH™ NVM space. Also these memory sections are
read/write protected and are defined and generated by the user. Please note that the NRG part does not provide any TOE
security functionality.
The implemented sleep mode logic (clock stop mode per ISO/IEC 7816-3) is used to reduce the overall power
consumption. Contactless products provide a low-power halt mode for operation with reduced power.
The bus system comprises two separate bus entities: a memory bus supporting high-speed communication between the
Core and Memories, and a peripheral bus for communication with the peripherals.
Subsequently, an intelligent shielding algorithm finishes the layers, finally providing the so called intelligent implicit active
           2
shielding “I -shield”. This provides physical protection against probing and forcing.
The STS (self-test software), RMS (Resource Management System), Service Algorithm Minimal (SAM) and Flash Loader
together compose the TOE firmware stored in the ROM and the patches hereof in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. All mandatory
functions for internal testing, production usage and start-up behavior (STS), and also the RMS and SAM functions are
grouped together in a common privilege level. These privilege levels are protected by a hardwired Memory Management
Unit (MMU) setting.
The user software can be implemented in various options depending on the user’s choice as described in chapter 1.1.

Thereby the user software, or parts of it, can be downloaded into the SOLID FLASH™ NVM, either during production of
the TOE or at customer side. In the latter case, the user downloads his software or the final parts of it at his own
premises, using the Flash Loader software.
The toolbox library does not provide cryptographic support or additional security functionality as it provides only the
following basic long integer arithmetic and modular functions in software, supported by the cryptographic coprocessor:
Addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, comparison, reduction, modular addition, modular subtraction, modular
multiplication, modular inversion and modular exponentiation. No security relevant policy, mechanism or function is
supported. The toolbox library is deemed for software developers as support for simplified implementation of long
integer and modular arithmetic operations. Please note that the toolbox part does not provide any TOE security
functionality.
The RSA library is used to provide a high level interface to RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman) cryptography implemented on
the hardware component Crypto@2304T and includes countermeasures against SPA, DPA and DFA attacks. The routines
are used for the RSA key generation (only in v2.07.003), RSA signature verification, the RSA signature generation and the
RSA modulus recalculation. The hardware Crypto@2304T unit provides the basic long number calculations (add, subtract,
multiply, square with 1100 bit numbers) with high performance. The RSA library is delivered as object code and in this
way integrated in the user software. The RSA library can perform RSA operations from 512 to 4096 bits.
                        1
Following the BSI recommendations, key lengths below 1976 bit are not included in the certificate.
The EC library is used to provide a high level interface to Elliptic Curve cryptography implemented on the hardware
component Crypto@2304T and includes countermeasures against SPA, DPA and DFA attacks. The routines are used for
ECDSA signature generation, ECDSA signature verification, ECDSA key generation and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key
agreement. In addition, the EC library provides an additional function for calculating primitive elliptic curve operations
                                                                                                   n
like EC Add and EC Double. EC curves over prime field Fp, as well as over GF(2 ) finite field are supported too.
The EC library is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software. The certification covers the
standard NIST [17] and Brainpool [18] Elliptic Curves with key lengths as defined in the SFRs. Note that there are further
uncounted side-channel-secure curve types which the user can optionally add in the composition certification process.
The Base library is used internally by the RSA, the EC and the Toolbox library, thus if one of the aforementioned libraries is
ordered, the Base library will be automatically included in the delivery. The Base library does not provide any additional
specific security functionality.
The SHA-library provides the calculation of a hash value of freely chosen data input in the CPU. The SHA-library is
delivered as object code and is in this way available for the user software.
This secure hash-algorithm SHA-2 is intended to be used for signature generation, verification and generic data integrity
checks. The use for keyed hash operations like HMAC or similar security critical operations involving keys, is not subject of
this TOE and requires specific security improvements and DPA analysis including the operating system, which is not part
of this TOE. Further essential information about the usage is given in the confidential user guidance [11].

The SCL library provides public cipher API for user application. The Cipher API contains functionality on operation with the
SCL: configuration of runtime settings, encryption and decryption of multiple data blocks using one of the built-in Block
Cipher Modes: ECB, CBC, CTR, CFB and PCBC. The SCL also provides functionality of adding custom BCMs. Public AES API
provides encryption and decryption of a 128-bit block using AES standard. The following key sizes are supported: 128 bits,
192 bits, 256 bits. Public DES API provides encryption and decryption of a 64-bit block using the following algorithms: DES
and TDES with an effective key size of 56 bits (+ 8 parity bits) as well as 112 and 168 bits. Please note that the PCBC block
cipher mode and the “*_Sec1”-functions of the SCL are not part of this evaluation.
Note that the TOE can be delivered without a specific optional software library. In this case the TOE does not provide the
additional specific security functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) or/and Elliptic Curve Cryptography
(EC) or/and SHA-2 or/and SCL based Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or/and SCL based Triple Data Encryption
Standard (TDES).
The TOE sets a new, improved standard of integrated security features, thereby meeting the requirements of all smart
card and other related applications or form factors, such as information integrity, access control, mobile telephone and
identification, as well as uses in electronic funds transfer and healthcare systems.
To sum up, the TOE is a powerful dual interface security controller with a large amount of memory and special peripheral
devices with improved performance, optimized power consumption, free to choose contact based or contactless
operation, at minimal chip size while implementing high security. It therefore constitutes the basis for future smart card
and other related applications or form factors.

2.2       Scope of the TOE

The TOE comprises:
          The silicon die, respectively the IC or hardware, in several versions:
               o    Each version differences from each other just by the input capacity of the RFI or by the additional metal
                    layer on top.
          The TOE is also delivered in various configurations, achieved by means of blocking.
          The user’s guidance documentation including hardware, software, Flash Loader, secure coding, and other
           reference manuals.
All product derivatives of this TOE, including all configuration possibilities, regardless whether coming with or without top
metal layer, are manufactured by Infineon Technologies AG. In the following descriptions, the term “manufacturer”
stands short for Infineon Technologies AG, the manufacturer of the TOE.
New configurations can occur at any time but in any case the user is able to clearly identify the TOE hardware, its
configuration and proof the validity of the certificate independently, meaning without involving the manufacturer.
Entirely all means of blocking and the, for the blocking involved firmware respectively software parts have been subject of
the evaluation. All resulting configurations of a TOE derivative are subject of the certificate. All resulting configurations
are either at the predefined limits or within the predefined configuration ranges.
The firmware used for the TOE internal testing and TOE operation, the firmware and software parts exclusively used for
the blocking, the parts of the firmware and software required for cryptographic support are part of the TOE and therefore
part of the certification. The documents as described in section 2.2.4 and referenced in Table 1, are supplied as user
guidance.
Not part of the TOE and not part of the certification are:
          The Smartcard Embedded Software respectively user software, and
          commercial parts the Billing-Per-Use software.

2.2.2          Firmware and Software of the TOE
For this TOE, the user can chose between different alternative firmware packages and can also chose the optional
libraries. The exact versions of firmware respectively optional software alternatives are given in Table 1.
The entire firmware of the TOE consists of different parts:
One part comprises the RMS and SAM routines for SOLID FLASH™ NVM programming, security functions test, and random
number online testing (Resource Management System, IC Dedicated Support Software in the Protection Profile [1]).
The RMS and SAM routines are stored from Infineon Technologies AG in the ROM, while belonging patches (if any) are
located in a protected area of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The ROM is only available for Infineon Technologies AG, the user
has no access.

The second part is the STS, consisting of test and initialization routines (Self-Test Software, IC Dedicated Test Software in
PP [1]). The STS routines are stored in the ROM and the belonging patch (if any) is located in a protected area of the
SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The STS is not accessible for the user software.
The third part is the Flash Loader. This piece of software is located in the ROM, but some parts of it are also stored in the
SOLID FLASH™ NVM. It enables the download of the user software or parts of it to the SOLID FLASH™ NVM. After
completion of the download the Flash Loader shall be locked by the by the user.
The fourth part is the NRG software interface routines. Note that these routines are always present, but are deactivated,
in case that a derivative comes without RF interface. Thus the user software interface is identical in both cases and
consequently the related interface routines can be called in each of the derivatives. In case the related NRG software
interface routines are called in derivatives without RF interface, an error code is returned. In the other case the related
function is performed. Please note that the NRG software interface does not provide any specific TOE security
functionality.
All parts of the firmware above are combined together by the TOE generation process to a single file and stored then in
the data files, the TOE is produced from. This comprises the firmware files for the ROM, where only Infineon Technologies
AG has access, as well as the data to be flashed in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM.
The optional software part of the TOE consists of the SCL, RSA, EC, SHA-2, Base and Toolbox libraries.
The SCL library is used to provide a high-level interface to DES/TDES and AES symmetric cryptographic operation. It uses
the SCP of the underlying hardware and implements countermeasures against all known weaknesses of the SCP v3 (e.g.
dummy calculations, block repetitions and backward calculation). The SCL library consists of three C-library files:
Cipher.lib, AES.lib, and DES.lib. These files are not distributed separately, and, therefore, all three files are called together
Symmetric Cryptographic Library. The SCL supports the ECB, CBC, CTR CFB and PCBC block cipher modes. Please note that
the PCBC mode, as well as “*_Sec1”-functions of the SCL, are not covered by the evaluation.
The SHA-2 library provides the calculation of a hash value of freely chosen data input in the CPU. The SHA-2 library is
delivered as object code and is in this way available for the user software. This secure hash-algorithm SHA-2 is intended to
be used for signature generation, verification and generic data integrity checks. The use for keyed hash operations like
HMAC or similar security critical operations involving keys, is not subject of this TOE and requires specific security
improvements and DPA analysis including the operating system, which is not part of this TOE. Further essential
information about the usage is given in the confidential user guidance.
The RSA library is used to provide a high level interface to the RSA cryptography implemented on the hardware
component Crypto@2304T and includes countermeasures against SPA, DPA and DFA attacks. The routines are used for
the RSA signature verification, the RSA signature generation and the RSA modulus recalculation. The module provides the
basic long number calculations (add, subtract, multiply, square with 1100 bit numbers) with high performance.
The RSA library is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software. The RSA library can perform
RSA operations from 512 to 4096 bits. Depending on the customer’s choice, the TOE can be delivered with the 4096 code
portion or with the 2048 code portion only. The 2048 code portion is included in both. Parts of the evaluation are the RSA

straight operations with key length from 1976bits to 2048 bits, and the RSA CRT operations with key lengths of 1976Bits
to 4096 Bits.
The EC library is used to provide a high level interface to Elliptic Curve cryptography and includes countermeasures
against SPA, DPA and DFA attacks. The routines are used for ECDSA signature generation, ECDSA signature verification,
ECDSA key generation and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement. In addition, the EC library provides an interface to
an addition function for primitive elliptic curve operations like ECC Add and ECC Double. ECC curves over prime field Fp,
                        n
as well as over GF(2 ) finite field are supported too.
The EC library is delivered as object code and in this way integrated in the user software. The certification covers the
standard NIST [17] and Brainpool [18] Elliptic Curves with key lengths as defined in the SFRs. Note that there are further
uncounted side-channel-secure curve types which the user can optionally add in the composition certification process.
The toolbox library does not provide cryptographic support or additional security functionality as it provides only the
following basic long integer arithmetic and modular functions in software, supported by the cryptographic coprocessor:
Addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, comparison, reduction, modular addition, modular subtraction, modular
multiplication, modular inversion and modular exponentiation. No security relevant policy, mechanism or function is
supported. No security relevant policy, mechanism or function is supported. The toolbox library is deemed for software
developers as support for simplified implementation of long integer and modular arithmetic operations.
The Base Library provides the low level interface to the asymmetric cryptographic coprocessor and is necessary in order
to use the EC, RSA or Toolbox library. Thus it is automatically included in the delivery if any of the aforementioned
libraries (EC, RSA, Toolbox) is ordered. The Base library does not provide any security functionality on its own.
Note:
The cryptographic libraries SCL, RSA, EC and SHA-2 are delivery options. The TOE may come with free combinations of or
even without these libraries. In the case of coming without one or any combination of the cryptographic libraries SCL,
RSA, EC and SHA-2, the TOE does not provide the Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman
Cryptography (RSA) and/or Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC) and/or SHA-2 and/or SCL based Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES) and/or SCL based Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES).


2.2.3             Interfaces of the TOE
The interfaces are constituted out of:
           The physical interface of the TOE to the external environment is the entire surface of the IC.
           The electrical interface of the TOE to the external environment is constituted by the pads of the chip, particularly
            the contacted RES, I/O, CLK lines and supply lines VCC and GND, as well as by the contactless RF interface. The
            contact based communication is according to ISO 7816/ETSI/EMV.
            Further combinations involving the pads and parts of the RF interface are also possible and described in the
            confidential Security Target [39] and in the hardware reference manual [6].

        The interface of the TOE to the operating system is constituted on one hand by the RMS routine calls and on the
         other by the instruction set of the TOE.
        The interface of the TOE to the test routines is formed by the STS test routine call, i.e. entry to test mode
         (STS-TM entry).
        The interface to the RSA calculations is defined from the RSA library interface.

        The interface to the symmetric crypto-operations DES/TDES/AES is defined from the SCL library interface.
Note that the interfaces to the optional software libraries (RSA, EC, Toolbox, SHA-2 and SCL) are optionally depending on
the customer order.

        SCL78 Symmetric Crypto Library for SCPv3 DES / AES 16-bit Security Controller User Interface [10]. This
         document contains the description of the user interface, general concepts and important security guidelines for
         software designers.
        SLx 70 Family, Secure Hash Algorithm SHA-2, (SHA 256/224, SHA 512/384) [11]. This document contains all
         interfaces of the SHA-2 library and is only delivered to the user in case the SHA-2 library is part of the delivered
         TOE.
        Crypto@2304T User Manual [12], describing the architecture of cryptographic coprocessor on register level. It
         also provides a functional description of the register architecture, instruction set and gives programming
         guidance.
        AMM Advanced Mode for NRG SAM [13], Addendum to M7892 Hardware Reference Manual. Additional user
         guidance how to use AMM. This documentation is provisioned to the user if the AMM option has been ordered.
         This user guidance describes the interface and how to use this communication mode. This is an addendum to the
         HRM [6].
        M7892 Security Guidelines [14]. This document discusses and provides code examples of how the user can
         consider the secure programming recommendations.
        M7892 Controller Family for Security Applications, Errata Sheet [15]. It can occur that the TOE or related
         documentation can be updated during the life cycle. This is reported to the users by the confidential Errata
         Sheet.
Finally the certification report may contain an overview of the recommendations to the software developer regarding the
secure use of the TOE. These recommendations are also included in the ordinary documentation.


2.2.5           Forms of Delivery
The TOE can be delivered:

        in form of complete modules
        with or without inlay mounting
        with or without inlay antenna mounting
        in form of plain wafers
        in any IC case (for example TSSOP28, VQFN32, VQFN40, CCS-modules, etc.)
        in no IC case or IC package, simply as bare dies
        or in whatever type of IC package
The form of delivery does not affect the TOE security and it can be delivered in any type, as long as the processes applied
and sites involved have been subject of the appropriate audit.

The delivery can therefore be at the end of phase 3 or at the end of phase 4 which can also include pre-personalization
steps according to PP [11]. Nevertheless in both cases the TOE is finished and the extended test features are removed. In
this document are always both cases mentioned to avoid incorrectness but from the security policy point of view the two
cases are identical.

The delivery to the software developer (phase 2  phase 1) contains the development package and is delivered in form
of documentation as described above, data carriers containing the tools and emulators as development and debugging
tool.
Part of the software delivery could also be the MAE and Flash Loader program, provided by Infineon Technologies AG,
running on the TOE and receiving the transmitted information of the user software to be loaded into the SOLID FLASH™
NVM. The download is only possible after successful authentication and the user software can also be downloaded in an
encrypted way. In addition, the user is after he finalized the download and prior deliver to third party obligated to
permanently lock further use of the Flash Loader (and MAE). Note that it depends on the procurement order, whether
the MAE and Flash Loader program is present or not.

The following table illustrates all TOE components, which may be delivered to a costumer, including the identification of
the delivered format (e.g. whether the user guidance document is delivered as a *.pdf or *.doc file) and the delivery
method (e.g. delivery courier or PGP-encrypted Email).

2.2.6         Production Sites
The TOE may be handled in different production sites but the silicon of this TOE is produced in Dresden, Germany only, as
listed below. To distinguish the different production sites of various products in the field, the site is coded into the
Generic Chip Ident Mode (GCIM) data. The exact coding of the generic hip identification data is described in the hardware
reference manual, [6].
The delivery measures are described in the ALC_DVS aspect.

3            Conformance Claims (ASE_CCL)

3.1         CC Conformance Claim

This Security Target (ST) and the TOE claim conformance to Common Criteria version v3.1 part 1 [2], part 2 [3] and part 3
[4] following the evaluation methodology will be used for this evaluation “Common Methodology for Information
Technology Security Evaluation” [33].
Furthermore conformance of this ST is claimed for:
Common Criteria part 2 extended and Common Criteria part 3 conformant.
The extended Security Functional Requirements are defined in chapter 6.


3.2         PP Claim

This Security Target is conformant to the Security IC Platform Protection Profile [1].
The Security IC Platform Protection Profile is registered and certified by the Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der
                           1
Informationstechnik (BSI) under the reference:
BSI-PP-0035, Version 1.0, dated 2007-06-15.
The Protection Profile [1] requires the strict conformance for the ST claiming conformance to this PP. This is mentioned in
chapter 2.2 of [1].


3.3         Package Claim

This Security Target does not claim conformance to a package of the PP [1].
The Security Target is EAL6 augmented with the component ALC_FLR.1.
                                           Table 7: Augmentations of the assurance level of the TOE

                   Assurance Class                          Assurance components                                      Description

                  Life-cycle support                                ALC_FLR.1                                Basic flaw remediation


Thus the targeted EAL6+ level includes already the augmentations of the PP [1] (AVA_VAN.5 and ALC_DVS.2) and includes
further augmentations compared to the predefined EAL6 assurance level (this package is defined in CC part 3).


3.4         Conformance Rationale

This Security Target claims conformance to one PP, the Security IC Platform Protection Profile [1].
The Protection Profile requires the strict conformance for the ST claiming conformance to this PP. This is mentioned in
chapter 2.2 of [1].
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is a typical security IC as defined in PP chapter 1.2.2 comprising:
            The circuitry of the IC (hardware including the physical memories).

        Configuration data, initialization data related to the IC Dedicated Software and the behavior of the security
         functionality.
        The IC Dedicated Software with the parts.
        The IC Dedicated Test Software.
        The IC Dedicated Support Software.
        The associated user’s guidance documentation.
The TOE is designed, produced and/or generated by the TOE Manufacturer.


3.4.1         Security Problem Definition:
Compared to the PP [1], the security problem definition of this Security Target is enhanced by adding:
        Additional threats (for details refer to chapter 4.1.1).
        Additional organization security policies (for details refer to chapter 4.2.1).
        And additional assumptions (for details refer to chapter 4.3.1).
Aside these add-ons, the security problem definition of this Security Target is consistent with the statement of the
security problem definition in the PP [1], as the Protection Profile [1] demands strict conformance.
The threats and OSPs of the Security Target are a superset of the ones defined in the PP [1]. Although an additional
assumption is defined in the Security Target compared to the PP [1], the Security Target is still strict conformant to the PP
[1], as the added assumption does neither mitigate a threat, which is meant to be addressed by a security objective for
the TOE nor does it fulfils an OSP, which is meant to be addressed by the security objectives for the TOE.


3.4.2         Security Objectives
Compared to the PP [1], the security objectives of this Security Target are enhanced by adding supplemental security
objectives (for details refer to 5.1). These modifications are necessary due to the additional security functionalities, one
coming from the cryptographic libraries - O.Add-Functions, and due to the memory access control - O.Mem-Access,
additional security objectives have been introduced.
The Security Target is still strict conformant to the PP [1], as it is permissible for a Security Target to contain additional
security objectives compared to the PP.


3.4.3         Summary
Due to the rationale provided above the Security Problem Definition (refer to chapter 4) and the Security Objectives (refer
to chapter 5) are strict conformant to the PP [1].
The Security Target enhances the required assurance package EAL4+ augmented with AVA_VAN.5 and ALC_DVS.2 of the
PP [1] to EAL6+ augmented with ALC_FLR.1. Thus the Security Target contains all assurance requirements, respectively
hierarchically higher assurance requirements, of the PP [1].
Furthermore all security functional requirements defined in the PP [1] are included and completely defined in the Security
Target and the augmented security functional requirements are listed in Table 17.

4         Security Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)

The content of the PP [1] applies to this chapter completely.


4.1      Threats

The threats are directed against the assets and/or the security functions of the TOE. For example, certain attacks are only
one step towards a disclosure of assets while others may directly lead to a compromise of the application security. The
more detailed description of specific attacks is given later on in the process of evaluation and certification. An overview
on attacks is given in PP [1] section 3.2.
The threats to security are defined and described in PP [1] section 3.2.
                                              Table 8: Threats according PP [1]

                       T.Abuse-Func                 Abuse of Functionality

                       T.RND                        Deficiency of Random Numbers


4.1.1         Additional Threat due to TOE Specific Functionality
The additional functionality of introducing sophisticated privilege levels and access control allows the secure separation
between the operation system(s) and applications, the secure downloading of applications after personalization and
enables multitasking by separating memory areas and performing access controls between different applications. Due to
this additional functionality “area based memory access control” a new threat is introduced.
The Smartcard Embedded Software is responsible for its User Data according to the assumption “Treatment of User Data
(A.Resp-Appl)”. However, the Smartcard Embedded Software may comprise different parts, for instance an operating
system and one or more applications. In this case, such parts may accidentally or deliberately access data (including code)
of other parts, which may result in a security violation.
The TOE shall avert the threat “Memory Access Violation (T.Mem-Access)” as specified below.

      T.Mem-Access             Memory Access Violation

                               Parts of the Smartcard Embedded Software may cause security violations by
                               accidentally or deliberately accessing restricted data (which may include code) or
                               privilege levels. Any restrictions are defined by the security policy of the specific
                               application context and must be implemented by the Smartcard Embedded Software.

                       T.Mem-Access                 Memory Access Violation


4.1.2         Assets Regarding the Threats
The primary assets concern the User Data which includes the user data as well as program code (Security IC Embedded
Software) stored and in operation and the provided security services. These assets have to be protected while being
executed and or processed and on the other hand, when the TOE is not in operation.
This leads to four primary assets with its related security concerns:
        SC1 Integrity of User Data and of the Security IC Embedded Software (while being executed/processed and while
         being stored in the TOE’s memories),
        SC2 Confidentiality of User Data and of the Security IC Embedded Software (while being processed and while
         being stored in the TOE’s memories)
        SC3 Correct operation of the security services provided by the TOE for the Security IC Embedded Software.
        SC4 Continuous availability of random numbers
SC4 is an additional security service provided by this TOE which is the availability of random numbers. These random
numbers are generated either by a true random number or a deterministic random number generator or by both, when a
true random number is used as seed for the deterministic random number generator. Note that the generation of
random numbers is a requirement of the PP [1].
To be able to protect the listed assets the TOE shall protect its security functionality as well. Therefore critical information
about the TOE shall be protected. Critical information includes:
        logical design data, physical design data, IC Dedicated Software, and configuration data
        Initialization Data and Pre-personalization Data, specific development aids, test and characterization related
         data, material for software development support, and reticles.
The information and material produced and/or processed by the TOE Manufacturer in the TOE development and
production environment (Phases 2 up to TOE Delivery) can be grouped as follows:
        logical design data,
        physical design data,
        IC Dedicated Software, Security IC Embedded Software, Initialization Data and Pre-personalization Data,
        specific development aids,
        test and characterization related data,
        material for software development support, and
        photomasks and products in any form,
as long as they are generated, stored, or processed by the TOE Manufacturer.
For details see PP [1] section 3.1.

4.2      Organizational Security Policies

The TOE has to be protected during the first phases of their lifecycle (phases 2 up to TOE delivery which can be after
phase 3 or phase 4). Later on each variant of the TOE has to protect itself. The organizational security policy covers this
aspect.

      P.Process-TOE           Protection during TOE Development and Production

                              An accurate identification must be established for the TOE. This requires that each
                              instantiation of the TOE carries this unique identification.


The organizational security policies are defined and described in PP [1] section 3.3. Due to the augmentations of PP [1] an
additional policy is introduced and described in the next chapter.
                                 Table 10: Organizational Security Policies according PP [1]

              P.Process-TOE                Protection during TOE Development and Production


4.2.1         Augmented Organizational Security Policy
Due to the augmentations compared to the PP [1] an additional policy is introduced.
The TOE provides specific security functionality, which can be used by the Smartcard Embedded Software. In the
following specific security functionality is listed which is not derived from threats identified for the TOE’s environment
because it can only be decided in the context of the smartcard application, against which threats the Smartcard
Embedded Software will use the specific security functionality.
The IC Developer / Manufacturer must apply the policy “Additional Specific Security Functionality (P.Add-Functions)” as
specified below.

      P.Add-Functions         Additional Specific Security Functionality

                              The TOE shall provide the following specific security functionality to the Smartcard
                              Embedded Software
                                      Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
                                      Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES)
                                      Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA)
                                      Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC)
                                      Secure Hash Algorithm SHA-2
Note:
The cryptographic libraries SCL, RSA, EC, SHA-2 and the Toolbox library are delivery options. Therefore the TOE may come
with free combinations of or even without these libraries. In the case of coming without one or any combination of the
cryptographic libraries SCL, RSA, EC and SHA-2, the TOE does not provide the Additional Specific Security Functionality
Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC) and/or SHA-2 and/or SCL based
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and/or SCL based Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES). The Toolbox library is no
cryptographic library and provides no additional specific security functionality. If RSA, EC or Toolbox are part of the

shipment, the Base Library is automatically included. The Base Library does not provide additional specific security
functionality.
Note:
This TOE can come with both crypto coprocessors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked crypto@2304T, or
with both crypto coprocessors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior to the production of the
hardware. In case the SCP is blocked, no AES and TDES computation supported by hardware is possible (neither solely
hardware based nor SCL based). In case the crypto@2304T is blocked, no RSA and EC computation supported by
hardware is possible. The use of the SHA-2 library is also possible with both crypto coprocessors blocked. No accessibility
of the deselected cryptographic coprocessors is without impact on any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly
equivalent to the situation where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic coprocessors.


4.3      Assumptions

The TOE assumptions on the operational environment are defined and described in PP [1] section 3.4.
The assumptions concern the phases where the TOE has left the chip manufacturer.

      A.Process-Sec-IC         Protection during Packaging, Finishing and Personalization

                               It is assumed that security procedures are used after delivery of the TOE by the TOE
                               Manufacturer up to delivery to the end-consumer to maintain confidentiality and
                               integrity of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test data (to prevent any possible
                               copy, modification, retention, theft or unauthorised use).



      A.Plat-Appl              Usage of Hardware Platform

                               The Security IC Embedded Software is designed so that the requirements from the
                               following documents are met: (i) TOE guidance documents (refer to the Common
                               Criteria assurance class AGD) such as the hardware data sheet, and the hardware
                               application notes, and (ii) findings of the TOE evaluation reports relevant for the
                               Security IC Embedded Software as documented in the certification report.



      A.Resp-Appl              Treatment of User Data

                               All User Data are owned by Security IC Embedded Software. Therefore, it must be
                               assumed that security relevant User Data (especially cryptographic keys) are treated by
                               the Security IC Embedded Software as defined for its specific application context.

The support of cipher schemas needs to make an additional assumption.


4.3.1         Augmented Assumptions
The developer of the Smartcard Embedded Software must ensure the appropriate “Usage of Key-dependent Functions
(A.Key-Function)” while developing this software in Phase 1 as specified below.

     A.Key-Function          Usage of Key-dependent Functions
                             Key-dependent functions (if any) shall be implemented in the Smartcard Embedded
                             Software in a way that they are not susceptible to leakage attacks (as described under
                             T.Leak-Inherent and T.Leak-Forced).



Note that here the routines which may compromise keys when being executed are part of the Smartcard Embedded
Software. In contrast to this the threats T.Leak-Inherent and T.Leak-Forced address (i) the cryptographic routines which
are part of the TOE.

5           Security Objectives (ASE_OBJ)

This section shows the subjects and objects, which are relevant to the TOE.
A short overview is given in the following.
The user has the following standard high-level security goals related to the assets:
            SG1 maintain the integrity of User Data and of the Security IC Embedded Software
            SG2 maintain the confidentiality of User Data and of the Security IC Embedded Software
            SG3 maintain the correct operation of the security services provided by the TOE for the Security IC Embedded
             Software
            SG4 provision of random numbers.


5.1        Security Objectives for the TOE

The security objectives of the TOE are defined and described in PP [1] section 4.1.

The TOE provides “Additional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions)” as specified below.

      O.Add-Functions           Additional Specific Security Functionality
                                The TOE must provide the following specific security functionality to the Smartcard
                                Embedded Software:
                                          Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
                                          Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES)
                                          Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)
                                          Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC)
                                          Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-2)
Note:
The cryptographic libraries SCL, RSA, EC, SHA-2 and the Toolbox library are delivery options. Therefore the TOE may come
with free combinations of or even without these libraries. In the case of coming without one or any combination of the

cryptographic libraries SCL, RSA, EC and SHA-2, the TOE does not provide the Additional Specific Security Functionality
Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC) and/or SHA-2 and/or SCL based
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and/or SCL based Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES). The Toolbox library is no
cryptographic library and provides no additional specific security functionality. If RSA, EC or Toolbox are parts of the
shipment, the Base Library is automatically included. The Base Library does not provide additional specific security
functionality.
Note:
This TOE can come with both crypto coprocessors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked Crypto@2304T, or
with both crypto coprocessors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior to the production of the
hardware. In case the SCP is blocked, no AES and TDES computation supported by hardware is possible (neither solely
hardware based nor SCL based). In case the crypto@2304T is blocked, no RSA and EC computation supported by
hardware is possible. The use of the SHA-2 library is also possible with both crypto coprocessors blocked. No accessibility
of the deselected cryptographic coprocessors is without impact on any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly
equivalent to the situation where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic Coprocessors.


The TOE shall provide “Area based Memory Access Control (O.Mem-Access)” as specified below.

      O.Mem-Access               Area based Memory Access Control

                                 The TOE must provide the Smartcard Embedded Software with the capability to define
                                 restricted access memory areas. The TOE must then enforce the partitioning of such
                                 memory areas so that access of software to memory areas and privilege levels is
                                 controlled as required, for example, in a multi-application environment.

5.2.1         Clarification of “Usage of Hardware Platform (OE.Plat-Appl)”
Regarding the cryptographic services this objective of the environment has to be clarified. The TOE supports cipher
schemes as additional specific security functionality. If required the Smartcard Embedded Software shall use these
cryptographic services of the TOE and their interface as specified. When key-dependent functions implemented in the
Smartcard Embedded Software are just being executed, the Smartcard Embedded Software must provide protection
against disclosure of confidential data (User Data) stored and/or processed in the TOE by using the methods described
under “Inherent Information Leakage (T.Leak-Inherent)” and “Forced Information Leakage (T.Leak-Forced)“.
The objectives of the environment regarding the memory, software and firmware protection and the SFR and peripheral-
access-rights-handling have to be clarified. For the separation of different applications the Smartcard Embedded Software
(Operating System) may implement a memory management scheme based upon security functions of the TOE.


5.2.2         Clarification of “Treatment of User Data (OE.Resp-Appl)”
Regarding the cryptographic services this objective of the environment has to be clarified. By definition cipher or plain
text data and cryptographic keys are User Data. The Smartcard Embedded Software shall treat these data appropriately,
use only proper secret keys (chosen from a large key space) as input for the cryptographic function of the TOE and use
keys and functions appropriately in order to ensure the strength of cryptographic operation.
This means that keys are treated as confidential as soon as they are generated. The keys must be unique with a very high
probability, as well as cryptographically strong. For example, it must be ensured that it is beyond practicality to derive the
private key from a public key if asymmetric algorithms are used. If keys are imported into the TOE and/or derived from
other keys, quality and confidentiality must be maintained. This implies that appropriate key management has to be
realized in the environment.
Regarding the memory, software and firmware protection and the SFR and peripheral access rights handling these
objectives of the environment has to be clarified. The treatment of User Data is also required when a multi-application
operating system is implemented as part of the Smartcard Embedded Software on the TOE. In this case the multi-
application operating system should not disclose security relevant user data of one application to another application
when it is processed or stored on the TOE.


5.2.3         Clarification of “Protection during composite product manufacturing
                 (OE.Process-Sec-IC)”
The protection during packaging, finishing and personalization includes also the personalization process (Flash Loader
software) and the personalization data (TOE software components) during Phase 4, Phase 5 and Phase 6.

5.3      Security Objectives Rationale

The security objectives rationale of the TOE are defined and described in PP [1] section 4.4. For the additional objectives
of this ST a rational is provided below.
                                           Table 15: Security Objective Rationale
                       Assumption, Threat or Organisational
                       Security Policy                                Security Objective
                       P.Add-Functions                                O.Add-Functions
                                                                      OE.Plat-Appl
                       A.Key-Function
                                                                      OE.Resp-Appl
                       T.Mem-Access                                   O.Mem-Access


The justification related to the security objective “Additional Specific Security Functionality (O.Add-Functions)” is as
follows: Since O.Add-Functions requires the TOE to implement exactly the same specific security functionality as required
by P.Add-Functions; the organizational security policy is covered by the objective.
Nevertheless the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing, O.Malfunction, O.Phys-Manipulation and O.Leak-
Forced define how to implement the specific security functionality required by P.Add-Functions. (Note that these
objectives support that the specific security functionality is provided in a secure way as expected from P.Add-Functions.)
Especially O.Leak-Inherent and O.Leak-Forced refer to the protection of confidential data (User Data or TSF data) in
general. User Data are also processed by the specific security functionality required by P.Add-Functions.
Compared to PP [1] clarification has been made for the security objective “Usage of Hardware Platform (OE.Plat-Appl)”: If
required the Smartcard Embedded Software shall use these cryptographic services of the TOE and their interface as
specified. In addition, the Smartcard Embedded Software must implement functions which perform operations on keys (if
any) in such a manner that they do not disclose information about confidential data. The non-disclosure due to leakage
A.Key-Function attacks is included in this objective OE.Plat-Appl. This addition ensures that the assumption A.Plat-Appl is
still covered by the objective OE.Plat-Appl although additional functions are being supported according to O.Add-
Functions.
Compared to the PP [1] a clarification has been made for the security objective “Treatment of User Data (OE.Resp-Appl)”:
By definition cipher or plain text data and cryptographic keys are User Data. So, the Smartcard Embedded Software will
protect such data if required and use keys and functions appropriately in order to ensure the strength of cryptographic
operation. Quality and confidentiality must be maintained for keys that are imported and/or derived from other keys.
This implies that appropriate key management has to be realized in the environment. That is expressed by the
assumption A.Key-Function which is covered from OE.Resp-Appl. These measures make sure that the assumption A.Resp-
Appl is still covered by the security objective OE.Resp-Appl although additional functions are being supported according
to P.Add-Functions.
Compared to the PP [1] an enhancement regarding memory area protection has been established. The clear definition of
privilege levels for operated software establishes the clear separation of different restricted memory areas for running
the firmware, downloading and/or running the operating system and to establish a clear separation between different

applications. Nevertheless, it is also possible to define a shared memory section where separated applications may
exchange defined data. The privilege levels clearly define by using a hierarchical model the access right from one level to
the other. These measures ensure that the threat T.Mem-Access is clearly covered by the security objective O.Mem-
Access.
The justification of the additional policy and the additional assumption show that they do not contradict to the rationale
already given in the Protection Profile for the assumptions, policy and threats defined there.

6          Extended Component Definition (ASE_ECD)

There are four extended components defined and described for the TOE:
          the family FCS_RNG at the class FCS Cryptographic Support
          the family FMT_LIM at the class FMT Security Management
          the family FAU_SAS at the class FAU Security Audit
          the component FPT_TST.2 at the class FPT Protection of the TSF
The extended components FCS_RNG, FMT_LIM and FAU_SAS are defined and described in PP [1] section 5. The
component FPT_TST.2 is defined in the following.


6.1       Component “Subset TOE Security Testing (FPT_TST.2)”

The security is strongly dependent on the correct operation of the security functions. Therefore, the TOE shall support
that particular security functions or mechanisms are tested in the operational phase (Phase 7). The tests can be initiated
by the Smartcard Embedded Software and/or by the TOE or is done automatically and continuously.
Part 2 of the Common Criteria provides the security functional component “TSF testing (FPT_TST.1)”. The component
FPT_TST.1 provides the ability to test the TSF’s correct operation.
For the user it is important to know which security functions or mechanisms can be tested. The functional component
FPT_TST.1 does not mandate to explicitly specify the security functions being tested. In addition, FPT_TST.1 requires
verification of the integrity of TSF data and of the stored TSF executable code which might violate the security policy.
Therefore, the functional component “Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)” of the family TSF self-test has been newly
created. This component allows that particular parts of the security mechanisms and functions provided by the TOE are
tested.


6.2       Definition of FPT_TST.2

The functional component “Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2)” has been newly created (Common Criteria Part 2
extended). This component allows that particular parts of the security mechanisms and functions provided by the TOE can
be tested after TOE Delivery or are tested automatically and continuously during normal operation transparent for the
user.
This security functional component is used instead of the functional component FPT_TST.1 from Common Criteria Part 2.
For the user it is important to know which security functions or mechanisms can be tested. The functional component
FPT_TST.1 does not mandate to explicitly specify the security functions being tested. In addition, FPT_TST.1 requires
verifying the integrity of TSF data and stored TSF executable code which might violate the security policy.
The functional component “Subset TOE testing (FPT_TST.2)” is specified as follows (Common Criteria Part 2 extended).

7.1.1.1 FCS_RNG
To define the IT security functional requirements of the TOE an additional family (FCS_RNG) of the Class FCS
(cryptographic support) is defined as an extended component in the PP [1]. This family describes the functional
requirements for random number generation used for cryptographic purposes. The PP [1] does already provide an
instance of this SFR with a completed selection and a partially completed assignment. The instance of FCS_RNG.1 that will
be used within this ST is completed according to AIS31 [5]. The element FCS_RNG.1.1 was subject of an editorial
refinement in order to provide an easy integration of the PTG.2 class from AIS31 [5]. Furthermore the element

FCS_RNG.1.2 was functionally refined, which is indicated by the underlined text. This refinement does specify the format
of the provided random numbers and does not mitigate the security functional requirement, as defined in the PP [1]. The
Security Target is still strict conformant to the PP [1], as the refined FCS_RNG.1 still meets the requirement as defined in
the PP [1].

 Dependencies:               No dependencies.

 FCS_RNG.1                   Random numbers generation Class PTG.2 according to [5]

 FCS_RNG.1.1                 The TSF shall provide a physical random number generator that implements:

                               PTG.2.1          A total failure test detects a total failure of entropy source
                                   immediately when the RNG has started. When a total failure is detected, no random
                                   numbers will be output.

                               PTG.2.2          If a total failure of the entropy source occurs while the RNG is being
                                   operated, the RNG prevents the output of any internal random number that
                                   depends on some raw random numbers that have been generated after the total
                                   failure of the entropy source.

                               PTG.2.3          The online test shall detect non-tolerable statistical defects of the raw
                                   random number sequence (i) immediately when the RNG has started, and (ii) while
                                   the RNG is being operated. The TSF must not output any random numbers before
                                   the power-up online test has finished successfully or when a defect has been
                                   detected.

                               PTG.2.4          The online test procedure shall be effective to detect non-tolerable
                                   weaknesses of the random numbers soon.

                               PTG.2.5 The online test procedure checks the quality of the raw random number
                                   sequence. It is triggered continuously. The online test is suitable for detecting non-
                                   tolerable statistical defects of the statistical properties of the raw random numbers
                                   within an acceptable period of time.

 FCS_RNG.1.2                 The TSF shall provide numbers in the format 8- or 16-bit that meet:

                               PTG.2.6          Test procedure A, as defined in [5] does not distinguish the internal
                                   random numbers from output sequences of an ideal RNG.

                               PTG.2.7          The average Shannon entropy per internal random bit exceeds 0.997.
Note:
The physical random number generator implements total failure test of the random source and a continuous RNG test
according to following standard:

7.1.1.2 FAU_SAS
To define the security functional requirements of the TOE an additional family (FAU_SAS) of the Class FAU (Security Audit)
is defined here. This family describes the functional requirements for the storage of audit data. It has a more general
approach than FAU_GEN, because it does not necessarily require the data to be generated by the TOE itself and because
it does not give specific details of the content of the audit records.
The TOE shall meet the requirement “Audit storage (FAU_SAS.1)” as specified below (Common Criteria Part 2 extended).

 FAU_SAS.1                    Audit Storage

 Hierarchical to              No other components.

 Dependencies:                No dependencies.

 FAU_SAS.1.1                  The TSF shall provide the test process before TOE Delivery with the capability to store
                              the Initialization Data and/or Pre-personalization Data and/or supplements of the
                              Security IC Embedded Software in the not changeable configuration page area and non-
                              volatile memory.


7.1.2          Subset of TOE Testing
The security is strongly dependent on the correct operation of the security functions. Therefore, the TOE shall support
that particular security functions or mechanisms are tested in the operational phase (Phase 7). The tests can be initiated
by the Smartcard Embedded Software and/or by the TOE.
The TOE shall meet the requirement “Subset TOE testing (FPT_TST.2)” as specified below (Common Criteria Part 2
extended).

 FPT_TST.2                    Subset TOE testing

 Dependencies:                No dependencies.

 FPT_TST.2.1                  The TSF shall run a suite of self-tests at the request of the authorized user to
                              demonstrate the correct operation of the alarm lines and/or following environmental
                              sensor mechanisms:
                              Please refer to the confidential Security Target [39].


7.1.3          Memory Access Control
Usage of multiple applications in one Smartcard often requires code and data separation in order to prevent that one
application can access code and/or data of another application. For this reason the TOE provides Area based Memory
Access Control. The underlying memory management unit (MMU) is documented in section 4 of the hardware reference
manual [6].

The security service being provided is described in the Security Function Policy (SFP) Memory Access Control Policy. The
security functional requirement “Subset access control (FDP_ACC.1)” requires that this policy is in place and defines the
scope were it applies. The security functional requirement “Security attribute based access control (FDP_ACF.1)” defines
security attribute usage and characteristics of policies. It describes the rules for the function that implements the Security
Function Policy (SFP) as identified in FDP_ACC.1. The decision whether an access is permitted or not is taken based upon
attributes allocated to the software. The Smartcard Embedded Software defines the attributes and memory areas. The
corresponding permission control information is evaluated “on-the-fly” by the hardware so that access is
granted/effective or denied/inoperable.
The security functional requirement “Static attribute initialization (FMT_MSA.3)” ensures that the default values of
security attributes are appropriately either permissive or restrictive in nature. Alternative values can be specified by any
subject provided that the Memory Access Control Policy allows that. This is described by the security functional
requirement “Management of security attributes (FMT_MSA.1)”. The attributes are determined during TOE
manufacturing (FMT_MSA.3) or set at run-time (FMT_MSA.1).
From TOE’s point of view the different roles in the Smartcard Embedded Software can be distinguished according to the
memory based access control. However the definition of the roles belongs to the user software.
The following Security Function Policy (SFP) Memory Access Control Policy is defined for the requirement “Security
attribute based access control (FDP_ACF.1)”:
 Memory Access Control
 Policy

                              The TOE shall control read, write, delete and execute accesses of software running at
                              the privilege levels as defined below. Any access is controlled, regardless whether the
                              access is on code or data or a jump on any other privilege level outside the current one.

Note that the additional function of the EC library, providing the primitive elliptic curve operations, does not add specific
security functionality.
Note:
This TOE can come with both crypto coprocessors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked crypto@2304T, or
with both crypto coprocessors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior to the production of the
hardware. In case the SCP is blocked, no AES and TDES computation supported by hardware is possible (neither solely
hardware based nor SCL based). In case the crypto@2304T is blocked, no RSA and EC computation supported by
hardware is possible. In case of a blocked crypto@2304T the optionally delivered cryptographic and the supporting
Toolbox and Base Library cannot be used in that TOE product. The use of the SHA-2 library is also possible with both
crypto coprocessors blocked. No accessibility of the deselected cryptographic coprocessors is without impact on any
other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly equivalent to the situation where the user decides just not to use the
cryptographic coprocessors.

    For the case the TOE comes without RSA and/or EC library, the TOE provides basic HW-related routines for RSA and/or EC calculations. For a secure
library implementation the user has to implement additional countermeasures himself.

Note:
     The minimum key length follows the national recommendations by the BSI which means that RSA key length below
     1976 bits are not included in the certificate. The key length requirements can differ between the countries. Please
     note that the BSI expects this key length as appropriate until 2022 and recommends for longer usage times key
     lengths of 3000 bits or higher.

Note:
     For easy integration of RSA functions into the user’s operating system and/or application, the library contains single
     cryptographic functions respectively primitives which are compliant to the standard. The primitives are referenced
     above. Therefore, the library supports the user to develop an application representing the standard if required.

Vulnerability Assessment      AVA_VAN.5             Advanced methodical vulnerability analysis        in PP [1]


7.2.1         Refinements
Some refinements are taken unchanged from the PP [1]. In some cases a clarification is necessary. In the table above an
overview is given where the refinement is done.
The refinements from the PP [1] have to be discussed here in the Security Target, as the assurance level is increased. The
refinements from the PP [1] are included in the chosen assurance level EAL 6 augmented with ALC_FLR.1.

7.2.1.1 Development (ADV)
ADV_IMP Implementation Representation:
The refined assurance package ADV_IMP.1 implementation representation of the TSF requires the availability of the
entire implementation representation, a mapping of the design description to the implementation representation with a
level of detail that the TSF can be generated without further design decisions. In addition, the correspondence of design
description and implementation representation shall be demonstrated.
The covered higher assurance package ADV_IMP.2 requires a complete and not curtailed mapping of the implementation
representation of the TSF, and the mapping of the design description to the entire implementation representation. In
addition, the correspondence of design description and the implementation representation shall be demonstrated. The
ADV_IMP.1 aspect and refinement remains therefore valid. The enhancement underlines the refinement in the PP [1] and
by that the entirely complete design i.e. not curtailed representation with according mapping was provided,
demonstrated and reviewed.
ADV_FSP Functional Specification:
The ADV_FSP.4 package requires a functional description of the TSFIs and there assignment to SFR-enforcing, SFR-
supporting, SFR-non-interfering, including related error messages, the assurance package. The enhancement of
ADV_FSP.5 requires additionally a complete semi-formal functional specification with additional error information. In
addition the package includes a tracing from the functional specification to the SFRs, as well as the TSFIs descriptions
including error messages not resulting from an invocation of a TSFI.
These aspects from ADV_FSP.5 are independent from the ADV_FSP.4 refinements from the PP [1] but constitute an
enhancement of it. By that the aspects of ADV_FSP.4 and its refinement in the PP [1] apply also here. The assurance and
evidence was provided accordingly.

7.2.1.2 Life-cycle Support (ALC)
ALC_CMS Configuration Management Scope:
The Security IC embedded firmware and the optional software are part of TOE and delivered together with the TOE as the
firmware and optional software are stored in the ROM and/or SOLID FLASH™ NVM. The presence of the optional parts

                                                                                                   Security Target Lite

belongs to the user order. Both, the firmware and software delivered with the TOE are controlled entirely by Infineon
Technologies AG. In addition, the TOE offers the possibility that the user can download his software at his own premises.
These parts of the software are user controlled only and are not part of this TOE. The download of this solely user
controlled software into the SOLID FLASH™ NVM is protected by strong authentication means. In addition, the download
itself could also be encrypted. By the augmentation of ALC_CMS.4 to ALC_CMS.5 the configuration list includes additional
the development tools. The package ALC_CMS.5 is therefore an enhancement to ALC_CMS.4 and the package with its
refinement in the PP [1] remains valid. The assurance and evidence was provided accordingly.
ALC_CMC Configuration Management Capabilities:
The PP [1] refinement from the assurance package ALC_CMC.4 Production support, acceptance procedures and
automation points out that the configuration items comprise all items defined under ALC_CMS to be tracked under
configuration management. In addition a production control system is required guaranteeing the traceability and
completeness of different charges and lots. Also the number of wafers, dies and chips must be tracked by this system as
well as procedures applied for managing wafers, dies or complete chips being removed from the production process in
order to verify and to control predefined quality standards and production parameters. It has to be controlled that these
wafers, dies or assembled devices are returned to the same production stage from which they are taken or they have to
be securely stored or destroyed otherwise.
The additionally covered extended package of ALC_CMC.5 Advance Support requires advanced support considering the
automatisms configuration management systems, acceptance and documentation procedures of changes, role separation
with regard to functional roles of personnel, automatisms for tracking and version controlling in those systems, and
includes also production control systems. The additional aspects of ALC_CMC.5 constitute an enhancement of ALC_CMC.4
and therefore the aspects and ALC_CMC.4 refinements in the PP [1] remain valid. The assurance and evidence was
provided.

7.2.1.3 Tests (ATE)
ATE_COV Test Coverage:
The PP [1] refined assurance package ATE_COV.2 Analysis of coverage addresses the extent to which the TSF is tested,
and whether or not the testing is sufficiently extensive to demonstrate that the TSF operates as specified. It includes the
test documentation of the TSFIs in the functional specification. In particular the refinement requires that The TOE must be
tested under different operating conditions within the specified ranges. In addition, the existence and effectiveness of
mechanisms against physical attacks should be covered by evidence that the TOE has the particular physical
characteristics. This is furthermore detailed in the PP [1].
This assurance package ATE_COV.2 has been enhanced to ATE_COV.3 to cover the rigorous analysis of coverage. This
requires the presence of evidence that exhaustive testing on rigorous entirely all interfaces as documented in the
functional specification was conducted. By that ATE_COV.2 and refinements as given in the PP [1] are enhanced by
ATE_COV.3 and remain as well. The TSFIs were completely tested according to ATE_COV.3 and the assurance and
evidence was provided.

7.2.2         ADV_SPM Formal Security Policy Model:
It is the objective of this family to provide additional assurance from the development of a formal security policy model of
the TSF, and establishing a correspondence between the functional specification and this security policy model.
Preserving internal consistency the security policy model is expected to formally establish the security principles from its
characteristics by means of a mathematical proof. The assurance and evidence was provided.

The security functional requirement(s) “Cryptographic operation (FCS_COP.1)” exactly requires those functions to be
implemented, which are demanded by O.Add-Functions. The FCS_CKM.1/EC supports the generation of RSA and EC keys
needed for this cryptographic operations. Therefore, FCS_COP.1/RSA, FCS_COP.1/ECDSA, FCS_COP.1/ECDH and
FCS_CKM.1/EC are suitable to meet the security objective. The FCS_COP.1/SHA is a keyless algorithm and has no
dependencies to FCS_CKM.1.
The symmetric services demanded by O.Add-Functions are provided via the SFRs FCS_COP.1/AES, FCS_COP.1/TDES,
FCS_COP.1/AES_SCL and FCS_COP.1/TDES_SCL. The TOE may not provide key generation for the symmetric cryptographic
operations (for further details please refer to chapter 7.3.1.1), however the SFRs FCS_CKM.4/AES, FCS_CKM.4/TDES,
FCS_CKM.4/AES_SCL and FCS_CKM.4/TDES_SCL provide the user with the possibility to destroy the keys, which are stored
on the TOE.
The use of the supporting libraries Toolbox and Base has no impact on any security functional requirement nor does the
use generate additional requirements.
Nevertheless, the developer of the Smartcard Embedded Software must ensure that the additional functions are used as
specified and that the User Data processed by these functions are protected as defined for the application context. This is
described by the objective for the operational environment OE.Resp-Appl. Furthermore the following dependencies have
to be fulfilled in order to use the security functional requirement FCS_COP.1:
        [FDP_ITC.1 Import of user data without security attributes or
         FDP_ITC.2 Import of user data with security attributes or
         FCS_CKM.1 Cryptographic key generation],
        FCS_CKM.4 Cryptographic key destruction.
As already mentioned above, some of these dependencies are already achieved by the TOE and can optionally be
achieved by the operational environment as well. However the remaining dependencies have to be fulfilled by the TOE
accordingly (OE.Resp-Appl). For further details on the dependencies, which have to be achieved by the operational
environment, please refer to chapter 7.3.1.1.
The security functional requirements required to meet the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing,
O.Malfunction, O.Phys-Manipulation and O.Leak-Forced define how to implement the specific security functionality.
However, key-dependent functions could be implemented in the Smartcard Embedded Software.
The usage of cryptographic algorithms requires the use of appropriate keys. Otherwise these cryptographic functions do
not provide security. The keys have to be unique with a very high probability, and must have a certain cryptographic
strength etc. In case of a key import into the TOE (which is usually after TOE delivery) it has to be ensured that quality and
confidentiality are maintained. Keys for RSA, TDES and AES are provided by the environment. Keys for EC algorithms can
be provided either by the TOE or the environment.
In this ST the objectives for the environment OE.Plat-Appl and OE.Resp-Appl have been clarified. The Smartcard
Embedded Software defines the use of the cryptographic functions FCS_COP.1 provided by the TOE. The requirements for
the environment FDP_ITC.1, FDP_ITC.2, FCS_CKM.1 and FCS_CKM.4 have to support an appropriate key management (for

The justification of the security objective and the additional requirements (both for the TOE and its environment) show
that they do not contradict to the rationale already given in the Protection Profile for the assumptions, policy and threats
defined there.
The security functional component Subset TOE security testing (FPT_TST.2) has been newly created (Common Criteria
Part 2 extended). This component allows that particular parts of the security mechanisms and functions provided by the
TOE can be tested after TOE Delivery. This security functional component is used instead of the functional component
FPT_TST.1 from Common Criteria Part 2. For the user it is important to know which security functions or mechanisms can
be tested. The functional component FPT_TST.1 does not mandate to explicitly specify the security functions being tested.
In addition, FPT_TST.1 requires verification of the integrity of TSF data and stored TSF executable code which might
violate the security policy.
The tested security enforcing functions are SF_DPM Device Phase Management, SF_CS Cryptographic Support and
SF_PMA Protection against modifying attacks.
The security functional requirement FPT_TST.2 will detect attempts to conduce a physical manipulation on the monitoring
functions of the TOE. The objective of FPT_TST.2 is O.Phys-Manipulation.
The security functional requirement “Subset access control (FDP_ACC.1)” with the related Security Function Policy (SFP)
“Memory Access Control Policy” exactly require the implementation of an area based memory access control as required
by O.Mem-Access. The related TOE security functional requirements FDP_ACC.1, FDP_ACF.1, FMT_MSA.3, FMT_MSA.1
and FMT_SMF.1 cover this security objective. The implementation of these functional requirements is represented by the
dedicated privilege level concept.
The justification of the security objective and the additional requirements show that they do not contradict to the
rationale already given in the Protection Profile for the assumptions, policy and threats defined there. Moreover, these
additional security functional requirements cover the requirements by [3] user data protection of chapter 11 which are
not refined by the PP [1].
Nevertheless, the developer of the Smartcard Embedded Software must ensure that the additional functions are used as
specified and that the User Data processed by these functions are protected as defined for the application context. The
TOE only provides the tool to implement the policy defined in the context of the application.
The security functional requirement “Stored data integrity monitoring (FDP_SDI.1)” requires the implementation of an
Error Detection (EDC) algorithm which detects integrity errors of the data stored in all memories. By this the manipulation
of the TOE using corrupt data is prevented. Therefore FDP_SDI.1 is suitable to meet the security objective O.Phys-
Manipulation.
The security functional requirement “Stored data integrity monitoring and action (FDP_SDI.2)” requires the
implementation of an integrity observation and correction which is implemented by the Error Detection (EDC) and Error
Correction (ECC) measures. The EDC is present throughout all memories of the TOE while the ECC is realized in the SOLID
FLASH™ NVM. These measures detect and inform about one and more bit errors. In case of the SOLID FLASH™ NVM 1 bit
errors of the data are corrected automatically. By the ECC mechanisms it is prevented that the TOE uses corrupt data. The
security reset performs an action to prevent the TOE to operate with manipulated data. Therefore FDP_SDI.2 is suitable
to meet the security objective.

Comment 1:
The TOE is already a platform representing the lowest level in a Smartcard. There is no lower or »underlying abstract
machine« used by the TOE which can be tested. Therefore, the former dependency to FPT_AMT.1 is fulfilled without
further and by that dispensable. CC in the Revision 3 considered this and dropped this dependency.


Comment 2:
The dependency FMT_SMR.1 introduced by the two components FMT_MSA.1 and FMT_MSA.3 is considered to be
satisfied because the access control specified for the intended TOE is not role-based but enforced for each subject.

Therefore, there is no need to identify roles in form of a security functional requirement FMT_SMR.1.


Comment 3:
These requirements all address the appropriate management of cryptographic keys used by the specified cryptographic
function and are not part of the PP [1]. Most requirements concerning key management shall be fulfilled by the
environment since the Smartcard Embedded Software is designed for a specific application context and uses the
cryptographic functions provided by the TOE.
For the security functional requirements FCS_COP.1/TDES, FCS_COP.1/TDES_SCL, FCS_COP.1/AES, FCS_COP.1/AES_SCL,
FCS_CKM.4/TDES, FCS_CKM.4/TDES_SCL, FCS_CKM.4/AES and FCS_CKM.4/AES_SCL the respective dependencies
FCS_CKM.1 or [FDP_ITC.1 or FDP_ITC.2] have to be fulfilled by the environment. This means, that the environment should
have a choice either to generate the symmetric keys (FCS_CKM.1) as defined in [3], section 10.1 or to import the keys
([FDP_ITC.1 or FDP_ITC.2]), as defined in [3], section 11.7.
For the security functional requirement FCS_COP.1/RSA-v1.02.013, FCS_COP.1/RSA-v2.07.003, FCS_COP.1/ECDSA-
v1.02.013, FCS_COP.1/ECDSA-v2.07.003, FCS_COP.1/ECDH-v1.02.013 and FCS_COP.1/ECDH-v2.07.003 the respective
dependencies FCS_CKM.4 have to be fulfilled by the environment. This means, that the environment shall provide the
respective key destruction (FCS_CKM.4) as defined in [3], section 10.1. The TOE does already provide the respective key
generation (FCS_CKM.1/EC-v1.02.013, FCS_CKM.1/EC-v2.07.003 and FCS_CKM.1/RSA-v2.07.003) as defined in 7.1.4.5.
However, the environment has to either implement its own key generation (e.g. FCS_CKM.1) as defined in [3], section
10.1, or, instead, import the generated key into the TOE ([FDP_ITC.1 or FDP_ITC.2]), as defined in [3], section 11.7.
The cryptographic libraries SCL, RSA, EC, SHA-2 and the Toolbox library are delivery options. If one of the libraries RSA, EC
and Toolbox or combination hereof are delivered, the Base Lib is automatically part of it. Therefore the TOE may come
with free combinations of or even without these libraries. In the case of coming without one or any combination of the
cryptographic libraries RSA, EC and SHA-2, the TOE does not provide the Additional Specific Security Functionality Rivest-
Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC) and/or SHA-2 and/or SCL based Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES) and/or SCL based Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES). The Toolbox and Base Library are no
cryptographic libraries and provide no additional specific security functionality.
In case of a blocked Crypto@2304T the optionally delivered cryptographic libraries RSA and EC, as well as the supporting
Toolbox and Base Libraries cannot be used in that TOE product. In case the SCP is blocked the optionally delivered
cryptographic library SCL cannot be used and TOE does not provide the solely hardware based AES and TDES calculation
as well. The SHA-2 library is computed in the CPUs and thus independent from the availability of the cryptographic
coprocessors.
If the TOE is delivered without a specific cryptographic service, depending on the chosen delivery options, the operational
environment does not have to fulfill the corresponding dependencies.
Comment 4
The dependencies FCS_CKM.1 and FMT_CKM.4 are not required for the SHA-2 algorithm, because the SHA-2 algorithm is
a keyless operation. So the environment is not obligated to meet certain requirements for key management.

7.3.2          Rationale of the Assurance Requirements
The chosen assurance level EAL6 is augmentation with the requirements coming from ALC_FLR.1. In Table 18 the different
assurance levels are shown as well as the augmentations. The augmentations are in compliance with the Protection
Profile.
An assurance level EAL6 with the augmentations ALC_FLR.1 is required for this type of TOE since it is intended to defend
against highly sophisticated attacks without protective environment over a targeted long life time. Thereby, the TOE
must withstand attackers with high attack potential, which is achieved by fulfilling the assurance class AVA_VAN.5.
In order to provide a meaningful level of assurance and that the TOE provides an adequate level of defense against such
high potential attacks, the evaluators have access to all information regarding the TOE including the TSF internals, the low
level design and source code including the testing of the modular design. Additionally the mandatory technical document
“Application of Attack Potential to Smartcards” [16] shall be taken as a basis for the vulnerability analysis of the TOE.
Due to the targeted long life time of the Infineon Technologies AG products, a comprehensive flaw remediation process
and database is in place to maintain the TOE also in future. Reported flaws of any kind, meaning, regardless whether the
flaws reported have a more directed towards quality, functional or security, are tracked by a dedicated database and
related processes.
And more, in order to continuously improve also future products reported flaws are analyzed whether they could affect
also future products. Due to its overall importance for future development, the assurance class ALC_FLR.1 is included in
this certification process.
This evaluation assurance package was selected to permit a developer gaining maximum assurance from positive security
engineering based on good commercial practices as well as the assurance that the TOE is maintained during its targeted
life time. The evaluation assurance package follows the EAL6 assurance classes as given in [4].

7.3.2.1 ALC_FLR.1 Basic Flaw Remediation
Flaws of any kind are entered into a dedicated database with related processes to solve those.
At the point in time where a flaw is entered, it is automatically logged who entered a flaw and who is responsible for
solving it. In addition, it is also documented if, when and how an individual flaw has been solved.
Flaws are prioritized and assigned to a responsibility.
The assurance class ALC_FLR.1 has no dependencies.

8          TOE Summary Specification (ASE_TSS)

The product overview is given in section 2.1. In the following the Security Features are described and the relation to the
security functional requirements is shown.
The TOE is equipped with following Security Features to meet the security functional requirements:
          SF_DPM          Device Phase Management
          SF_PS           Protection against Snooping
          SF_PMA          Protection against Modification Attacks
          SF_PLA          Protection against Logical Attacks
          SF_CS           Cryptographic Support
The following description of the Security Features is a complete representation of the TSF.


8.1       SF_DPM: Device Phase Management

The life cycle of the TOE is split-up in several phases. Chip development and production (phase 2, 3, 4) and final use
(phase 4-7) is a rough split-up from TOE point of view. These phases are implemented in the TOE as test mode (phase 3)
and user mode (phase 4-7).
In addition a chip identification mode exists which is active in all phases. The chip identification data (O.Identification) is
stored in a not changeable configuration page area and non-volatile memory. In the same area further TOE configuration
data is stored. In addition, user initialization data can be stored in the non-volatile memory during the production phase
as well. During this first data programming, the TOE is still in the secure environment and in Test Mode. The covered
security functional requirement is FAU_SAS.1 “Audit storage”.
During start-up of the TOE the decision for one of the various operation modes is taken dependent on phase identifiers.
The decision of accessing a certain mode is defined as phase entry protection. The phases follow also a defined and
protected sequence. The sequence of the phases is protected by means of authentication.
The covered security functional requirements are FMT_LIM.1 and FMT_LIM.2.
During the production phase (phase 3 and 4) or after the delivery to the customer (phase 5 or phase 6), the TOE provides
the possibility to download, after a successful authentication process, a user specific encryption key and user code and
data into the empty (erased) SOLID FLASH™ NVM area as specified by the associated control information of the Flash
Loader software. This process is only possible after a successful authentication process. The integrity of the loaded data is
checked with a signature process. The data to be loaded may be transferred optionally in encrypted form. After finishing
the load operation, the Flash Loader can be permanently deactivated, so that no further load operation with the Flash
Loader is possible. These procedures are defined as phase operation limitation.
The covered security functional requirement is FPT_LIM.2 “Limited availability”.
During operation within a phase the accesses to memories are granted by the MMU controlled access rights and related
privilege level.
The covered security functional requirements are FDP_ACC.1, FDP_ACF.1 and FMT_MSA.1.

public

In addition, during each start-up of the TOE the address ranges and access rights are initialized by the STS with predefined
values. The covered security functional requirement is FMT_MSA.3.
The TOE clearly defines access rights and privilege levels in conjunction with the appropriate key management in
dependency of the firmware or software to be executed. By this clearly defined management functions are implemented,
enforced by the MMU, and the covered security functional requirement is FMT_SMF.1.
During the testing phase in production within the secure environment the entire SOLID FLASH™ NVM is deleted. The
covered security functional requirement is FPT_PHP.3.
Each operation phase is protected by means of authentication and encryption. The covered security functional
requirements are FDP_ITT.1 and FPT_ITT.1.
The SF_DPM “Device Phase Management” covers the security functional requirements FAU_SAS.1, FMT_LIM.1,
FMT_LIM.2, FDP_ACC.1, FDP_ACF.1, FMT_MSA.1, FMT_MSA.3, FMT_SMF.1, FPT_PHP.3, FDP_ITT.1 and FPT_ITT.1.


8.2      SF_PS: Protection against Snooping

All contents of all memories of the TOE are encrypted on chip to protect against data analysis on stored data as well as on
internally transmitted data. There is no plain data on the chip. In addition the data transferred over the buses, the SFRs
and the peripheral devices (CRC, RNG and Timer) are encrypted as well.
The memory content and bus encryption is done by the MED using a complex key management and by the memories
SOLID FLASH™ NVM, RAM, CACHE and the bus are entirely encrypted. Note that the ROM contains the firmware only and
no user data.
Therefore, no data in plain is handled anywhere on the TOE and thus also the two CPUs compute entirely masked. The
symmetric cryptographic coprocessor is entirely masked as well.
The encryption covers the data processing policy and FDP_IFC.1 “Subset information flow control“.
The covered security functional requirements are FPT_PHP.3, FDP_IFC.1, FPT_ITT.1 and FDP_ITT.1.
The user can define his own key for an SOLID FLASH™ NVM area to protect his data. This user individually chosen key is
then delivered by the operating system and included in the dynamic SOLID FLASH™ NVM encryption. The user specified
SOLID FLASH™ NVM area is then encrypted with his key and another component. The encryption of the memories is
performed by the memory encryption and decryption unit MED providing protection against cryptographic analysis
attacks. The few keys which have to be stored on the chip are protected against read out.
The covered security functional requirements are FPT_PHP.3, FDP_IFC.1, FPT_ITT.1, and FDP_ITT.1.
The CPU has no standard command set and discloses therefore no possibility for deeper analysis. The covered security
functional requirement is FPT_PHP.3.
The entire design is kept in a non-standard way to aggravate attacks using standard analysis methods to an almost not
practical condition. A proprietary CPU with a non-public bus protocol is implemented which makes analysis very
complicate and time consuming.
Important parts of the chip are especially designed to counter leakage or side channel attacks like DPA/SPA or
EMA/DEMA. Therefore, even the physical data gaining is difficult to perform, since timing and current consumption is
almost independent of the processed data, protected by a bunch of other protecting means.

In the design a number of components are automatically synthesized and mixed up to disguise their physical boarders
and to make an analysis more difficult.
A further protective design method implements special routing measure against probing.
The covered security functional requirements are FPT_PHP.3, FPT_ITT.1 and FDP_ITT.1.
In addition to their protection during processing of code and data their storage in the SOLID FLASH™ NVM is protected
against side channel attacks too: Even if users operate with direct and static addressing for storing their secrets, the
addresses are always translated and modified. In addition the correct privilege level is controlled by the MMU.
The covered security functional requirements are FPT_PHP.3, FPT_ITT.1 and FDP_ITT.1.
In contrast to the linear virtual address range the physical SOLID FLASH™ NVM pages are transparently and dynamically
scrambled. These measures cause that the physical location of data is different from chip to chip. Even user software
would always call the equal physical addresses.
An observation of the clock is used to prevent the TOE from single stepping. This is tested by the user mode security life
control UMSLC.
The covered security functional requirements are FPT_PHP.3 and FPT_FLS.1.
An induced error which cannot be corrected will be recognized by the Integrity Guard and leads to an alarm. In case of
security critical detections a security alarm and reset is generated. The covered security functional requirement is
FPT_FLS.1.
The SF_PS “Protection against Snooping” covers the security functional requirements FPT_PHP.3, FDP_IFC.1, FPT_ITT.1,
FDP_ITT.1 and FPT_FLS.1.


8.3      SF_PMA: Protection against Modifying Attacks

First of all we can say that all security mechanisms effective against snooping SF_PS apply also here since a reasonable
modification of data is almost impossible on dynamically encrypted, masked, scrambled, transparently relocated,
randomized and topologically protected hardware. Due to this the covered security functional requirements are
FPT_PHP.3, FDP_IFC.1, FPT_ITT.1, FDP_ITT.1 and FPT_FLS.1.
The TOE is equipped with an error detection code (EDC) which covers the memory system of RAM, ROM and SOLID
FLASH™ NVM and includes also the MED, MMU and the bus system. Thus introduced failures are detected and certain
errors are also automatically corrected (FDP_SDI.2).
In order to prevent accidental bit faults during production in the ROM, over the data stored in ROM an EDC value is
calculated (FDP_SDI.1).
The covered security functional requirements are FRU_FLT.2, FPT_PHP.3, FDP_SDI.1 and FDP_SDI.2.
If a user tears the card resulting in a power off situation during a SOLID FLASH™ NVM programming operation or if other
perturbation is applied, no data or content loss occurs and the TOE restarts power on. The SOLID FLASH™ NVM tearing
save write functionality covers FPT_FLS.1 “Failure with preservation of secure state” since if the programming was not
successful, the old data are still present and valid, which ensures a secure state although a programming failure occurred.
This action includes also FDP_SDI.1 “Stored data integrity monitoring” as the new data to be programmed are checked for
integrity and correct programming before the page with the old data becomes the new physical page for the next new

data.
The covered security functional requirement is also FPT_PHP.3 “Resistance to physical attack“, since these measures
make      it    difficult   to      manipulate    the       write   process       of   the     SOLID     FLASH™       NVM.
The covered security functional requirements are FPT_FLS.1, FPT_PHP.3 and FDP_SDI.1.
The TOE is protected against fault and modifying attacks. The core provides the functionality of double-computing and
result comparison of all tasks to detect incorrect calculations. The detection of an incorrect calculation is stored and the
TOE enters a defined secure state which causes the chip internal reset process.
The implementation of two CPUs computing on the same data is by this one of the most important security features of
this platform. As the results of both CPUs are compared at the end, a fault induction of modifying attacks would have to
be done on both CPUs at the correct place with the correct timing – despite all other countermeasures like dynamic
masking, encryption and others. As the comparison and the register files are also protected by various measures
successful manipulative attacks are seen as being not practical.
During start up, the STS performs various configurations and subsystem tests. After the STS has finished, the operating
system or application can call the User Mode Security Life Control (UMSLC) test. The UMSLC checks the alarm lines and
number of functions and sensors for correct operation.
This test can be released actively by the user software during normal chip operation at any time.
In the case that a physical manipulation or a physical probing attack is detected, the processing of the TOE is immediately
stopped and the TOE enters a secure state called security reset. By release of a security reset all logic and memory of the
coprocessors (SCP and Crypto) immediately reset with their respective reset values. The stored keys are overwritten with
the default reset values and memory data structures are overwritten with random values. The covered security functional
requirements are FCS_CKM.4 (all iterations), FPT_FLS.1, FPT_PHP.3 and FPT_TST.2.
As physical effects or manipulative attacks may also address the program flow of the user software, a watchdog timer and
a check point register are implemented. These features allow the user to check the correct processing time and the
integrity of the program flow of the user software.
Another measure against modifying and perturbation respectively differential fault attacks (DFA) is the implementation of
backward calculation in the SCP. By this induced errors are discovered.
The covered security functional requirements are FPT_FLS.1, FDP_IFC.1, FPT_ITT.1, FDP_ITT.1 and FPT_PHP.3.
The RMS provides the user also the testing of all security features enabled to generate an alarm. This security testing is
called user mode security life control (UMSLC). As attempts to modify the security features will be detected from the test,
the covered security functional requirement is FPT_TST.2.
All communication via the busses is in addition protected by a monitored hardware handshake. If the handshake was not
successful an alarm is generated.
The covered security functional requirements are FPT_FLS.1 and FPT_PHP.3.
The virtual memory system and privilege level model are enforced by the MMU. This controls the access rights
throughout the TOE. There is a clear differentiation within the privilege levels defined. The covered security functional
requirements are FDP_ACC.1, FDP_ACF.1, FMT_MSA.1, FMT_MSA.3 and FMT_SMF1.

The SF_PMA “Protection against Modifying Attacks” covers the security functional requirements FCS_CKM.4 (all
iterations), FPT_PHP.3, FDP_IFC.1, FPT_ITT.1, FDP_ITT.1, FMT_MSA.1, FMT_MSA.3, FMT_SMF.1, FDP_ACC.1, FDP_ACF.1,
FRU_FLT.2, FPT_TST.2, FDP_SDI.1, FDP_SDI.2 and FPT_FLS.1.


8.4      SF_PLA: Protection against Logical Attacks

The memory access control of the TOE uses a memory management unit (MMU) to control the access to the available
physical memory by using virtual memory addresses and to segregate the code and data to a privilege level model. The
MMU controls the address permissions of the privileged levels and gives the software the possibility to define different
access rights. The address permissions of the privilege levels are controlled by the MMU. In case of an access violation the
MMU will trigger a reset and then a trap service routine can react on the access violation. The policy of setting up the
MMU and specifying the memory ranges, to a certain extent, for the privilege levels – with the exception of the IFX level -
is defined from the user software (OS).
As the TOE provides support for separation of memory areas the covered security functional requirements are FDP_ACC.1
“Subset access control”, FDP_ACF.1 “Security attribute based access control”, FMT_MSA.3 “Static attribute initialization”,
FMT_MSA.1 “Management of security attributes” and FMT_SMF.1 “Specification of Management functions”.
The TOE provides the possibility to protect the property rights of user code and data by the encryption of the SOLID
FLASH™ NVM areas with a specific key defined by the user. Due to this key management FDP_ACF.1 is fulfilled. In
addition, all memories present on the TOE are individually encrypted using individual keys assigned by complex key
management. All data are protected by means of encryption or masking also during transportation via the busses.
Induced errors are recognized by the Integrity Guard concept and lead to an alarm. In case of security critical errors a
security alarm is generated and the TOE ends up in a secure state. The covered security functional requirements are
FPT_PHP.3, FDP_ITT.1, FPT_ITT.1, FDP_IFC.1 and FPT_FLS.1.
Beside the access protection and key management, also the use of illegal operation code is detected and will release a
security reset.
The SF_PLA “Protection against Logical Attacks” covers the security functional requirements FDP_ACC.1, FDP_ACF.1,
FMT_MSA.1, FMT_MSA.3, FPT_PHP.3, FDP_ITT.1, FPT_ITT.1, FDP_IFC.1, FPT_FLS.1 and FMT_SMF.1.


8.5      SF_CS: Cryptographic Support

The TOE is equipped with several hardware accelerators and software modules to support the standard symmetric and
asymmetric cryptographic operations. This security function is introduced to include the cryptographic operation in the
scope of the evaluation as the cryptographic function respectively mathematic algorithm itself is not used from the TOE
security policy. On the other hand these functions are of special interest for the use of the hardware as platform for the
software. The components are a coprocessor supporting the DES and AES algorithms (alternatively a combination of a
coprocessor and software, if the SCL is used) and a combination of a coprocessor and software modules to support RSA
cryptography, ECDSA signature generation and verification, ECDH key agreement and EC public key calculation and public
key testing.

Note that the additional function of the EC library, ECC_ADD, providing the primitive elliptic curve operations, does not
add specific security functionality and that the according user guidance abbreviates the Elliptic Curve cryptographic
functions with ECC.
Note:
The cryptographic libraries SCL, RSA, EC, SHA-2 and the Toolbox library are delivery options. If one of the libraries RSA, EC
and Toolbox or combination hereof are delivered, the Base Lib is automatically part of it. Therefore the TOE may come
with free combinations of or even without these libraries. In the case of coming without one or any combination of the
cryptographic libraries SCL, RSA, EC and/or SHA-2, the TOE does not provide the corresponding additional specific security
functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC) and/or SHA-2 and/or SCL
based Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and/or SCL based Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES). The Toolbox and
Base Library are no cryptographic libraries and provide no additional specific security functionality.
Note:
This TOE can come with both crypto coprocessors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked Crypto@2304T, or
with both crypto coprocessors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior to the production of the
hardware. In case the SCP is blocked, no AES and DES computation supported by hardware is possible (neither solely
hardware based nor SCL based). In case the Crypto@2304T is blocked, no RSA and EC computation supported by
hardware is possible. The use of the SHA-2 library is also possible with both crypto coprocessors blocked. No accessibility
of the deselected cryptographic coprocessors is without impact on any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly
equivalent to the situation where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic coprocessors.

The TOE implements the block cipher modes as specified in the SFR FCS_COP.1/TDES_SCL.
To implement FCS_CKM.4/TDES_SCL, SCL software performs reset triggering at the end of the kernel function
(Des3Green_EnDecryption) by writing the “trigger reset” value 0xFFFF to the SCP_CTRL register (hardware). As a result,
the key store register is overwritten with the reset value. The second step is a removal of the complete DES data object
from RAM by overwriting it by random value.
Please consider also the statement of chapter 7.1.4.1.
Please note that the PCBC mode and the “*_Sec1”-functions of the SCL are not part of the evaluation.
The covered security functional requirements are FCS_COP.1/TDES_SCL and FCS_CKM.4/TDES_SCL.

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), FIPS PUB 197.
The TOE implements the block cipher modes as specified in the SFR FCS_COP.1/AES.
Please consider also the statement of chapter 7.1.4.1.
The key destruction can be done by overwriting the key register interfaces of the SCP or by a software reset of the SCP,

8.5.5         SHA-2
The TOE comes optionally with the SHA-2 library for hash value calculation. Regarding the SHA-2 library it has to be noted
that the secure hash-algorithm SHA-2 is intended to be used for signature generation, verification and generic data
integrity checks. The use for keyed hash operations like HMAC or similar security critical operations involving keys, is not
subject of this TOE and requires specific security improvements and DPA analysis including the operating system, which is
not part of this TOE. Further essential information about the usage is given in the confidential user guidance [11].
Nevertheless, following is valid:
The TSF shall perform hash-value calculation of user chosen data in accordance with a specified cryptographic algorithm
SHA-2 and with cryptographic key sizes of none that meet the following standards:
U.S. Department of Commerce / National Institute of Standards and Technology, Secure Hash Standard (SHS), FIPS PUB

The covered security functional requirement is FCS_COP.1/SHA.


8.5.6         PTRNG Respectively TRNG
Random data is essential for cryptography as well as for security mechanisms. The TOE is equipped with a physical True
Random Number Generator (TRNG, FCS_RNG.1). The random data can be used from the Smartcard Embedded Software
and is also used from the security features of the TOE, like masking. The PTRNG or TRNG implements also self-testing
features. The PTRNG or TRNG meets the requirements of the functionality class PTG2 of the AIS31 [5].
The covered security functional requirement is FCS_RNG.1, FPT_PHP.3, FDP_ITT.1, FPT_ITT.1, FDP_IFC.1, FPT_TST.2 and

FCS_CKM.4/TDES, FCS_CKM.4/TDES_SCL, FCS_COP.1/AES, FCS_COP.1/AES_SCL, FCS_CKM.4/AES, FCS_CKM.4/AES_SCL,
FCS_COP.1/RSA-v1.02.013, FCS_COP.1/RSA-v2.07.003, FCS_CKM.1/RSA-v2.07.003, FCS_COP.1/ECDSA-v1.02.013,
FCS_COP.1/ECDSA-v2.07.003, FCS_CKM.1/EC-v1.02.013, FCS_CKM.1/EC-v2.07.003, FCS_COP.1/ECDH-v1.02.013,
FCS_COP.1/ECDH-v2.07.003, FCS_COP.1/SHA, FPT_PHP.3, FDP_ITT.1, FPT_ITT.1, FDP_IFC.1, FPT_TST.2, FPT_FLS.1 and
FCS_RNG.1.
Note:
The cryptographic libraries SCL, RSA, EC, SHA-2 and the Toolbox library are delivery options. If one of the libraries RSA, EC
and Toolbox or combination hereof are delivered, the Base Lib is automatically part of it. Therefore the TOE may come
with free combinations of or even without these libraries. In the case of coming without one or any combination of the
cryptographic libraries SCL, RSA, EC and SHA-2, the TOE does not provide the corresponding additional specific security
functionality Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Cryptography (RSA) and/or Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EC) and/or SHA-2 and/or SCL
based Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES) and/or SCL based Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The Toolbox and
Base Library are no cryptographic libraries and provide no additional specific security functionality.
Note:
This TOE can come with both crypto coprocessors accessible, or with a blocked SCP or with a blocked Crypto@2304T, or
with both crypto coprocessors blocked. The blocking depends on the customer demands prior to the production of the
hardware. In case the SCP is blocked, no AES and TDES computation supported by hardware is possible (neither solely
hardware based nor SCL based). In case the Crypto@2304T is blocked, no RSA and EC computation supported by
hardware is possible. The use of the SHA-2 library is also possible with both crypto coprocessors blocked. No accessibility
of the deselected cryptographic coprocessors is without impact on any other security policy of the TOE; it is exactly
equivalent to the situation where the user decides just not to use the cryptographic coprocessors.


8.6      Assignment of Security Functional Requirements to TOE’s Security Functionality

The justification and overview of the mapping between security functional requirements (SFR) and the TOE’s security
functionality (SF) is given in sections the sections above. The results are shown in Table 21. The security functional
requirements are addressed by at least one relating security feature.
The various functional requirements are often covered manifold. As described above the requirements ensure that the
TOE is checked for correct operating conditions and if a not correctable failure occurs that a stored secure state is
achieved, accompanied by data integrity monitoring and actions to maintain the integrity although failures occurred. An
overview is given in the table below.

8.7      Security Requirements are Internally Consistent

For this chapter the PP [1] section 6.3.4 can be applied completely.
In addition to the discussion in section 6.3 of PP [1] the security functional requirement FCS_COP.1 is introduced. The
security functional requirements required to meet the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing,
O.Malfunction, O.Phys-Manipulation and O.Leak-Forced also protect the cryptographic algorithms implemented
according to the security functional requirement FCS_COP.1. Therefore, these security functional requirements support
the secure implementation and operation of FCS_COP.1.
As disturbing, manipulating during or forcing the results of the test checking the security functions after TOE delivery, this
security functional requirement FPT_TST.2 has to be protected. An attacker could aim to switch off or disturb certain
sensors or filters and preserve the detection of his manipulation by blocking the correct operation of FPT_TST.2. The
security functional requirements required to meet the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing,
O.Malfunction, O.Phys-Manipulation and O.Leak-Forced also protect the security functional requirement FPT_TST.2.
Therefore, the related security functional requirements support the secure implementation and operation of FPT_TST.2.
The requirement FPT_TST.2 allows testing of some security mechanisms by the Smartcard Embedded Software after
delivery. In addition, the TOE provides an automated continuous user transparent testing of certain functions.
The implemented privilege level concept represents the area based memory access protection enforced by the MMU. As
an attacker could attempt to manipulate the privilege level definition as defined and present in the TOE, the functional
requirement FDP_ACC.1 and the related other requirements have to be protected themselves. The security functional
requirements required to meet the security objectives O.Leak-Inherent, O.Phys-Probing, O.Malfunction, O.Phys-
Manipulation and O.Leak-Forced also protect the area based memory access control function implemented according to
the security functional requirement described in the security functional requirement FDP_ACC.1 with reference to the
Memory Access Control Policy and details given in FDP_ACF.1. Therefore, those security functional requirements support
the secure implementation and operation of FDP_ACF.1 with its dependent security functional requirements.
The requirement FDP_SDI.2.1 allows detection of integrity errors of data stored in memory. FDP_SDI.2.2 in addition
allows correction of one bit errors or taking further action. Both meet the security objective O.Malfunction.

The requirements FRU_FLT.2, FPT_FLS.1, and FDP_ACC.1 which also meet this objective are independent from FDP_SDI.2
since they deal with the observation of the correct operation of the TOE and not with the memory content directly.
