A.      Certification

1.      Preliminary Remarks
Under the BSIG1 Act, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) has the task of
issuing certificates for information technology products.
Certification of a product is carried out on the instigation of the vendor or a distributor,
hereinafter called the sponsor.
A part of the procedure is the technical examination (evaluation) of the product according
to the security criteria published by the BSI or generally recognised security criteria.
The evaluation is normally carried out by an evaluation facility recognised by the BSI or by
BSI itself.
The result of the certification procedure is the present Certification Report. This report
contains among others the certificate (summarised assessment) and the detailed
Certification Results.
The Certification Results contain the technical description of the security functionality of
the certified product, the details of the evaluation (strength and weaknesses) and
instructions for the user.

2.      Specifications of the Certification Procedure
The certification body conducts the procedure according to the criteria laid down in the
following:
●   Act on the Federal Office for Information Security 1
●   BSI Certification and Approval Ordinance2
●   BSI Schedule of Costs3
●   Special decrees issued by the Bundesministerium des Innern (Federal Ministry of the
    Interior)
●   DIN EN ISO/IEC 17065 standard
●   BSI certification: Scheme documentation describing the certification process (CC-
    Produkte) [3]
●   BSI certification: Scheme documentation on requirements for the Evaluation Facility, its
    approval and licencing process (CC-Stellen) [3]
●   Common Criteria for IT Security Evaluation (CC), Version 3.1 4 [1] also published as
    ISO/IEC 15408.

3.      Recognition Agreements
In order to avoid multiple certification of the same product in different countries a mutual
recognition of IT security certificates - as far as such certificates are based on ITSEC or
CC - under certain conditions was agreed.

3.1.    European Recognition of CC – Certificates (SOGIS-MRA)
The SOGIS-Mutual Recognition Agreement (SOGIS-MRA) Version 3 became effective in
April 2010. It defines the recognition of certificates for IT-Products at a basic recognition
level and, in addition, at higher recognition levels for IT-Products related to certain SOGIS
Technical Domains only.
The basic recognition level includes Common Criteria (CC) Evaluation Assurance Levels
EAL 1 to EAL 4. For "Smartcards and similar devices" a SOGIS Technical Domain is in
place. For "HW Devices with Security Boxes" a SOGIS Technical Domains is in place, too.
In addition, certificates issued for Protection Profiles based on Common Criteria are part of
the recognition agreement.
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes, details on
recognition, and the history of the agreement can be seen on the website at
https://www.sogis.eu.
The SOGIS-MRA logo printed on the certificate indicates that it is recognised under the
terms of this agreement by the related bodies of the signatory nations. A disclaimer
beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of recognition.
This certificate is recognized under SOGIS-MRA for all assurance components selected.

3.2.    International Recognition of CC – Certificates (CCRA)
The international arrangement on the mutual recognition of certificates based on the CC
(Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement, CCRA-2014) has been ratified on 08
September 2014. It covers CC certificates based on collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP)
(exact use), CC certificates based on assurance components up to and including EAL 2 or
the assurance family Flaw Remediation (ALC_FLR) and CC certificates for Protection
Profiles and for collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP).
The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes can be seen on
the website: https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org.
The Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement logo printed on the certificate indicates
that this certification is recognised under the terms of this agreement by the related bodies
of the signatory nations. A disclaimer beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of
recognition.
This certificate is recognized according to the rules of CCRA-2014, i. e. up to and including
CC part 3 EAL 2+ ALC_FLR components.

conducted by TÜV Informationstechnik GmbH. The evaluation was completed on 16
November 2020. TÜV Informationstechnik GmbH is an evaluation facility (ITSEF)5
recognised by the certification body of BSI.
For this certification procedure the sponsor and applicant is: Infineon Technologies AG.
The product was developed by: Infineon Technologies AG.
The certification is concluded with the comparability check and the production of this
Certification Report. This work was completed by the BSI.

5.      Validity of the Certification Result
This Certification Report applies only to the version of the product as indicated. The
confirmed assurance package is valid on the condition that
●   all stipulations regarding generation, configuration and operation, as given in the
    following report, are observed,
●   the product is operated in the environment described, as specified in the following report
    and in the Security Target.
For the meaning of the assurance components and assurance levels please refer to CC
itself. Detailed references are listed in part C of this report.
The Certificate issued confirms the assurance of the product claimed in the Security Target
at the date of certification. As attack methods evolve over time, the resistance of the
certified version of the product against new attack methods needs to be re-assessed.
Therefore, the sponsor should apply for the certified product being monitored within the
assurance continuity program of the BSI Certification Scheme (e.g. by a re-assessment or
re-certification). Specifically, if results of the certification are used in subsequent evaluation
and certification procedures, in a system integration process or if a user's risk
management needs regularly updated results, it is recommended to perform a re-
assessment on a regular e.g. annual basis.

In order to avoid an indefinite usage of the certificate when evolved attack methods would
require a re-assessment of the products resistance to state of the art attack methods, the
maximum validity of the certificate has been limited. The certificate issued on 17
November 2020 is valid until 16 November 2025. Validity can be re-newed by re-
certification.
The owner of the certificate is obliged:
     1. when advertising the certificate or the fact of the product's certification, to refer to
        the Certification Report as well as to provide the Certification Report, the Security
        Target and user guidance documentation mentioned herein to any customer of the
        product for the application and usage of the certified product,
     2. to inform the Certification Body at BSI immediately about vulnerabilities of the
        product that have been identified by the developer or any third party after issuance
        of the certificate,
     3. to inform the Certification Body at BSI immediately in the case that security relevant
        changes in the evaluated life cycle, e.g. related to development and production sites
        or processes, occur, or the confidentiality of documentation and information related
        to the Target of Evaluation (TOE) or resulting from the evaluation and certification
        procedure where the certification of the product has assumed this confidentiality
        being maintained, is not given any longer. In particular, prior to the dissemination of
        confidential documentation and information related to the TOE or resulting from the
        evaluation and certification procedure that do not belong to the deliverables
        according to the Certification Report part B, or for those where no dissemination
        rules have been agreed on, to third parties, the Certification Body at BSI has to be
        informed.
In case of changes to the certified version of the product, the validity can be extended to
the new versions and releases, provided the sponsor applies for assurance continuity (i.e.
re-certification or maintenance) of the modified product, in accordance with the procedural
requirements, and the evaluation does not reveal any security deficiencies.

are the CPU (Central Processing Unit), an MPU (Memory Protection Unit), a Nested
Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC) and an Instruction Stream Signature Checking (ISS).
The dual interface controller is able to communicate using either the contact based or the
contactless interface. Also, a variety of software libraries is present or optionally available,
i.e. NRGTM library, HSL (hardware support library), UMSLC (user mode security life control)
library, SCL (symmetric cryptographic library) and ACL (asymmetric cryptographic library).
This TOE is intended to be used in smart cards for particular security relevant applications
and as a developing platform for smart card operating systems. The term smartcard
embedded software is used in the following for all operating systems and applications
stored and executed on the TOE. The TOE is the platform for the smartcard embedded
software.
Depending on the blocking configuration, the TOE can have e.g. different user available
memory sizes and can come with or without individual accessible cryptographic
coprocessors. All products are identical in regard to module design, layout and footprint.
The Security Target [6] is the basis for this certification. It is based on the certified
Protection Profile Security IC Platform Protection Profile with Augmentation Packages
Version 1.0, 13 January 2014, BSI-CC-PP-0084-2014 [8].
The TOE Security Assurance Requirements (SAR) are based entirely on the assurance
components defined in Part 3 of the Common Criteria (see part C or [1], Part 3 for details).
The TOE meets the assurance requirements of the Evaluation Assurance Level EAL 6
augmented by ALC_FLR.1.
The TOE Security Functional Requirements (SFR) relevant for the TOE are outlined in the
Security Target [6] and [9], chapter 6. They are selected from Common Criteria Part 2 and
some of them are newly defined. Thus the TOE is CC Part 2 extended.
The TOE Security Functional Requirements are implemented by the following TOE

                                      Table 2: Deliverables of the TOE

Please note that NRG functionality and toolbox are out of scope of this evaluation, hence
no evaluated TOE guidance documentation applies. However, respective developer
provided documentation may be available. User discretion is advised.
The delivery documentation describes all procedures that are necessary to maintain
security when distributing versions of the TOE or parts of it to the user’s site including the
necessary intermediate delivery procedures.
Furthermore, the delivery documentation describes in a sufficient manner how the various
procedures and technical measures provide for the detection of modifications and any
discrepancies between the TOE respective parts of it send by the TOE Manufacturer and
the version received by the Composite Product Manufacturer.
Three different delivery procedures have to be taken into consideration:
●   Delivery of the IC dedicated software components (IC dedicated SW, guidance) from the
    TOE Manufacturer to the IC Embedded Software Developer.
●   Delivery of the IC Embedded Software (ROM / Flash data, initialisation and pre-
    personalisation data) from the IC Embedded Software Developer to the TOE
    Manufacturer.




                                                                                                13 / 36
Certification Report                                                      BSI-DSZ-CC-1107-2020




●   Delivery of the final TOE from the TOE Manufacturer to the Composite Product
    Manufacturer. After phase 3 the TOE is delivered in form of wafers or sawn wafers, after
    phase 4 in form of modules (with or without inlay antenna) or any other packaging form
    as offered.
Respective distribution centers are listed in Appendix B (see end of document).
The individual TOE hardware is uniquely identified by its identification data. Each individual
TOE can therefore be traced unambiguously and thus assigned to the entire development
and production process.
The hardware part of the TOE is identified by IFX_CCI_00002Dh, IFX_CCI_000039h,
IFX_CCI_00003Ah,     IFX_CCI_000044h,       IFX_CCI_000045h,   IFX_CCI_000046h,
IFX_CCI_000047h,     IFX_CCI_000048h,      IFX_CCI_000049h,    IFX_CCI_00004Ah,
IFX_CCI_00004Bh, IFX_CCI_00004Ch, IFX_CCI_00004Dh, IFX_CCI_00004Eh design
step T11.
Another characteristic of the TOE are the chip identification data. These chip identification
data is accessible via the Generic Chip Identification Mode (GCIM) (see [12], section 4.5).
At TOE start-up the so called GCIM can be chosen by applying special signalling in
contactless or contact based communication and the TOE outputs then the generic chip
identification data (unless another configuration option is chosen). This data contain the
firmware identifier accompanied with the certification identifier, the design step and even
more tracking information. In combination with [12] (section 4.5) the user can identify the
data, interpret it and retrieve the TOE versioning information. This information includes
also the required mapping of firmware identifier and certification identifier.
The optional software libraries can be identified by their unique version numbers and by
calculating a hash value (e.g. SHA-256) over the delivered lib-files (.lib) and comparing the
calculated vales to the values stated in Security Target [6] and [9], sections 9 - 13.

3.      Security Policy
The security policy enforced is defined by the selected set of security functional
requirements and implemented by the TOE. It covers the following issues:
The security policy of the TOE is to provide basic security functionalities to be used by the
smart card operating system and the smart card application, thus providing an overall
smart card system security. Therefore, the TOE will implement a symmetric cryptographic
block cipher algorithm (Triple-DES and AES) to ensure the confidentiality of plain text data
by encryption and to support secure authentication protocols and it will provide different
random number generators.
The RSA library is used to provide a high-level interface to RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman)
cryptography implemented on the hardware component Crypto@2304T and includes
countermeasures against SPA, DPA and DFA attacks. The EC library is used to provide a
high-level interface to Elliptic Curve cryptography implemented on the hardware
component Crypto@2304T and includes countermeasures against SPA, DPA and DFA
attacks.
Besides that, the TOE can come with the optional Hardware Support Library (HSL)
providing a simplified interface for NVM management and provides the possibility to write
tearing safe into the NVM.




                                                                                        14 / 36
BSI-DSZ-CC-1107-2020                                                          Certification Report




As the TOE is a hardware security platform, the security policy of the TOE is also to
provide protection against leakage of information (e.g. to ensure the confidentiality of
cryptographic keys during AES, Triple-DES, RSA and EC cryptographic functions
performed by the TOE), against physical probing, against malfunctions, against physical
manipulations and against abuse of functionality. Hence the TOE shall:
●   maintain the integrity and the confidentiality of data stored in the memory of the TOE,
    and
●   maintain the integrity, the correct operation and the confidentiality of security
    functionalities (security mechanisms and associated functions) provided by the TOE.
Specific details concerning the above mentioned security policies can be found in sections
6 and 7 of the Security Target [6] and [9].

4.      Assumptions and Clarification of Scope
The assumptions defined in the Security Target and some aspects of threats and
organisational security policies are not covered by the TOE itself. These aspects lead to
specific security objectives to be fulfilled and measures to be taken by the IT environment,
the user or the risk manager. The following topics are of relevance:
The objective OE.Resp-Appl states that the IC embedded software developer shall treat
user data (especially keys) of the composite product appropriately. The IC embedded
software developer gets sufficient information on how to protect user data adequately in
the security guidelines [14].
The ST includes the following security objectives for the operational environment, which
are relevant for the Composite Product Manufacturer: OE.Process-Sec-IC,
OE.Lim_Block_Loader, OE.Loader_Usage, OE.TOE_Auth, and OE.Prevent_Masquerade.
The objective OE.Process-Sec-IC requires the protection of the TOE, as well as of its
manufacturing and test data up to the delivery to the end-consumer. As defined in [6] and
[9] section 1.4.5 the TOE can be delivered to the composite product manufacturer after
phase 3 or after phase 4. However, the single chips are identical in all cases. This means
that the test mode is deactivated and the TOE is locked in the user mode. Therefore, it is
not necessary to distinguish between these forms of delivery. Since Infineon has no
information about the security requirements of the implemented IC embedded software it is
not possible to define any concrete security requirements for the environment of the
composite product manufacturer.
The objective OE.TOE_Auth requires that the environment has to support the
authentication and verification mechanism and has to know the corresponding
authentication reference data. The composite product manufacturer receives sufficient
information with regard to the authentication mechanism in [15], section 2.1.5. Please note
that this objective is only valid in case the Flash Loader is ordered with mutual
authentication (i.e., option External Authentication is unavailable).
The objective OE.Prevent_Masquerade is valid in case the Flash Loader is ordered with
External Authentication (EA) instead of mutual authentication. In this case, customers
need to take care that not masquerading attacks can be performed. The objective replaces
OE.Loader-Usage. A description of the External Authentication is given in [15], section
2.1.5 and further highlights the risks of masquerading attacks when using this order option
of the flash loader:




                                                                                           15 / 36
Certification Report                                                      BSI-DSZ-CC-1107-2020




         The objective OE.Prevent_Masquerade is valid in case the Flash Loader is ordered
         with External Authentication (EA) instead of a mutual authentication. In this case,
         customers need to take care that not masquerading attacks can be performed.
The objective OE.Loader_Usage requires that the authorised user has to support the
trusted communication with the TOE by protecting the confidentiality and integrity of the
loaded data and he has to meet the access conditions defined by the flash loader. [ 15],
section 4 provides sufficient information regarding this topic.
The objective OE.Lim_Block_Loader requires the composite product manufacturer to
protect the loader against misuse, to limit the capability of the loader and to terminate the
loader irreversibly after the intended usage. The permanent deactivation of the flash loader
is described in [15], section 2.1.2.2. This objective for the environment originates from the
“Package 1: Loader dedicated for usage in secured environment only”. However, this TOE
also implements “Package 2: Loader dedicated for usage by authorized users only” and
thus the flash loader can also be used in an unsecure environment and is able to protect
itself against misuse if the authentication and download keys are handled appropriately.

5.      Architectural Information
For further information on the TOE architecture, see Security Target [6] and [9], section 1
(especially sections 1.3 and 1.4).

6.      Documentation
The evaluated documentation as outlined in table 2 is being provided with the product to
the customer. This documentation contains the required information for secure usage of
the TOE in accordance with the Security Target.
Additional obligations and notes for secure usage of the TOE as outlined in chapter 10 of
this report have to be followed.

7.      IT Product Testing
Regarding functional testing:
Different classes of functional tests were performed by the developer to test the TOE:
●   Simulation tests (design verification),
●   Qualification tests,
●   Verification Tests,
●   Security Evaluation Tests,
●   Production Tests.
The developer’s testing results demonstrate that the TSFs behave as specified. The
developer’s testing results also demonstrate that the TOE behaves as expected.
In the course of the evaluation of the TOE, the following classes of functional tests were
carried out by the ITSEF:
●   Module tests,
●   Simulation tests,




                                                                                         16 / 36
BSI-DSZ-CC-1107-2020                                                         Certification Report




●   Emulation tests,
●   Tests in user mode,
●   Tests in test mode,
●   Hardware tests,
●   Optional library tests,
●   repetition of developer tests (see above).
With these kinds of tests the entire security functionality of the TOE was tested.
The results of the (functional) developer tests, which have been repeated by the evaluator,
matched the results the developer stated.
Overall the TSF has been functionally tested against the functional specification, the TOE
design and the security architecture description. The tests demonstrate that the TSF
performs as specified.
Regarding AVA related tests:
The overall test result is that no deviations were found between the expected and the
actual test results. No attack scenario with the attack potential high was actually
successful in the TOE’s operational environment as defined in [6] and [9], provided that all
measures required by the developer are applied.
The embedded software has to implement the security advices given in [11] - [20].

8.      Evaluated Configuration
In the broadest sense, the production of the mask sets for the chip production may be
looked upon as the procedure for the system generation. The TOE can be delivered in the
following hardware configurations
IFX_CCI_00002Dh,    IFX_CCI_000039h,             IFX_CCI_00003Ah,         IFX_CCI_000044h,
IFX_CCI_000045h,    IFX_CCI_000046h,              IFX_CCI_000047h,        IFX_CCI_000048h,
IFX_CCI_000049h,   IFX_CCI_00004Ah,              IFX_CCI_00004Bh,        IFX_CCI_00004Ch,
IFX_CCI_00004Dh and IFX_CCI_00004Eh.
This TOE is represented by various configurations called products. The module design,
layout and footprint, of all products are identical. The degree of freedom for configuring the
TOE is predefined by the developer.
Furthermore comprising of firmware and optional software libraries with revisions stated in
section 2. The flash loader (part of FW) was enabled on evaluated derivative.
An extensive overview over all possible configuration options is given in the Security
Target [6] and [9] in sections 1.4.5 and 1.4.7.
The evaluation results, also including results of tests performed by the developer, are valid
for all hardware derivates mentioned above. All identifiers represent the equal hardware
platform but name differences in configurations or market segments. Configuration
differences are achieved by blocking only. The firmware and optional software libraries
were examined in those revisions, which are stated in table 2 (above).
The evaluation results are valid for all configurations and blocking options of the hardware
stated in section 1.4.7 of the Security Target [6] and [9]. Depending on configuration,
blocking option and on selection of optional software libraries, some of the services might

The user must ensure a working configuration. The evaluation results apply to all
configurations of Flash Loader, BPU and PIN-Letter as stated in the Security Target [6] and
[9].
The evaluation results cannot be extended to further versions/derivates of the TOE and/or
other production sites without any extra investigations.
Developer and evaluator tested the TOE in these configurations in which the TOE is
delivered and which is described above and in Section 2.

9.2.    Results of cryptographic assessment
The strength of the cryptographic algorithms was not rated in the course of this certification
procedure (see BSIG Section 9, Para. 4, Clause 2). But cryptographic functionalities with a
security level of lower than 100 bits can no longer be regarded as secure without
considering the application context. Therefore, for these functionalities it shall be checked
whether the related crypto operations are appropriate for the intended system. Some
further hints and guidelines can be derived from the 'Technische Richtlinie BSI TR-02102'
(https://www.bsi.bund.de).
The following table (which originates from the ITSEF-evaluated table in [7] and in this
certification report is enhanced by the 100 bit column) provides an overview of the
cryptographic functionalities inside the TOE to enforce the security policy and outlines its
rating from cryptographic point of view. Any Cryptographic Functionality that is marked in
column 'Security Level above 100 Bits' of the following table with 'no' achieves a security
level of lower than 100 Bits (in general context) only.

                                  Table 3: TOE cryptographic functionality

The TOE’s memory enryption, named ICS (“ICS-C8”) and not separately listed above, was
evaluated according to BSI’s “Methodology for cryptographic rating of memory encryption
schemes used in smartcards and similar devices” (Version 1.0, 2013-10-31).




                                                                                                         25 / 36
Certification Report                                                     BSI-DSZ-CC-1107-2020




Regarding the cryptographic functionalities listed in rows #32 - #34 (RSA key generation
based on CryptoRsaKeyGenMask_PQ), the following applies:
        CryptoRsaKeyGenMask_PQ is used for key component p, q (i.e. prime number)
        generation. It implements [FIPS186-4] section B.3.3 method using AIS31 PTG.2
        RBG for prime generation and [FIPS186-4] section C.3.1 primality test, extended by
        additional tests. It is to be remarked that [FIPS186-4] section B.3.3 allows this
        generation method only for 2048 and 3072 bit keys. That kind of conformance then
        was confirmed by the ITSEF in the course of the evaluation, regardless of said
        standard not being explicitly claimed in the respective FCS_CKM.1 SFRs of the
        Security Target [6] and [9].
The Flash Loader's cryptographic strength with regard to the mode “external authenticate”
(see #45 in table 4) was not assessed by BSI. However, the evaluation according to the
TOE's Evaluation Assurance Level (including VAN.5) did not reveal any implementation
weaknesses.
Please note, that this holds true also for those algorithms, where no cryptographic 100-Bit-
Level assessment was given at all (i.e where ”N/A” was stated). Consequently, the
targeted Evaluation Assurance Level has been achieved for those functionalities as well.
Further conformance evaluation and assessment to claimed cryptographic functionality
standards is documented in the confidential report “Cryptographic Standards Compliance
Verification” [21].

10. Obligations and Notes for the Usage of the TOE
The documents as outlined in table 2 contain necessary information about the usage of the
TOE and all security hints therein have to be considered. In addition all aspects of
Assumptions, Threats and OSPs as outlined in the Security Target not covered by the TOE
itself need to be fulfilled by the operational environment of the TOE.
The customer or user of the product shall consider the results of the certification within his
system risk management process. In order for the evolution of attack methods and
techniques to be covered, he should define the period of time until a re-assessment of the
TOE is required and thus requested from the sponsor of the certificate.
The limited validity for the usage of cryptographic algorithms as outlined in chapter 9 has
to be considered by the user and his system risk management process, too.
Some security measures are partly implemented in this certified TOE, but require
additional configuration or control or measures to be implemented by a product layer on



                                                                                          27 / 36
Certification Report                                                        BSI-DSZ-CC-1107-2020




top, e.g. the Embedded Software using the TOE. For this reason the TOE includes
guidance documentation (see table 2) which contains obligations and guidelines for the
developer of the product layer on top on how to securely use this certified TOE and which
measures have to be implemented in order to fulfil the security requirements of the
Security Target of the TOE. In the course of the evaluation of the composite product or
system it must be examined if the required measures have been correctly and effectively
implemented by the product layer on top. Additionally, the evaluation of the composite
product or system must also consider the evaluation results as outlined in the document
"ETR for composite evaluation" [10].
At the point in time when evaluation and certification results are reused there might be an
update of the document "ETR for composite evaluation" available. Therefore, the certified
products list on the BSI website has to be checked for latest information on
reassessments, recertifications or maintenance result available for the product.
Furthermore:
The TOE is delivered to the composite product manufacturer and to the security IC
embedded software developer. The actual end-consumer obtains the TOE from the
composite product issuer together with the application which runs on the TOE.
The security IC embedded software developer receives all necessary recommendations
and hints to develop his software in form of the delivered documentation.
●   All security hints described in the delivered documents in [11] - [20] have to be
    considered.
The composite product manufacturer receives all necessary recommendations and hints to
develop his software in form of the delivered documentation.
●   All security hints described in [15] have to be considered.
In addition the following hint resulting from the evaluation of the ALC evaluation aspect has
to be considered:
●   The security IC embedded software developer can deliver his software either to Infineon
    to let them implement it in the TOE (in the Flash memory) or to the composite product
    manufacturer to let him download the software in the Flash memory.
●   The delivery procedure from the security IC embedded software developer to the
    composite product manufacturer is not part of this evaluation and a secure delivery is
    required. The TOE provides a flash loader with mutual authentication to establish a
    secure channel. In this case a secure transport is not required.
●   The TOE can come with a pre-loaded image called Performance Flash Loader, which is
    a non-TOE component. Using the PFL results in a non-certified product.

11.     Security Target
For the purpose of publishing, the Security Target [9] of the Target of Evaluation (TOE) is
provided within a separate document as Annex A of this report. It is a sanitised version of
the complete Security Target [6] used for the evaluation performed. Sanitisation was
performed according to the rules as outlined in the relevant CCRA policy (see AIS 35 [4]).

12. Regulation specific aspects (eIDAS, QES)
None.
